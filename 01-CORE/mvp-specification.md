- **Cross-Module Intelligence**: Provides NLP, voice processing, and cultural context for all other modules
- **Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ 7 production-ready cookbooks with complete API documentation

**üí∞ Mudra (AI Personal Finance)**: Automatic transaction analysis via SMS/email with offline-first architecture
- **Soch Integration**: Uses Soch's language models for Hinglish financial communication parsing
- **Core Features**: UPI transaction detection, GST compliance, voice financial queries
- **Implementation Status**: üöß Active development with complete UI designs and SMS parsing algorithms

**üìö Sikshak (AI Educational Tutor)**: Culturally-aware AI companion for personalized learning
- **Soch Integration**: Leverages Soch's emotional intelligence and cultural awareness for age-appropriate education
- **Mudra Integration**: Financial literacy education using real expense data for practical learning
- **Implementation Status**: üìã Phase 2 ready with complete design specifications
