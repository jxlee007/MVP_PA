# Multi-Agent Architecture for AI Workflows (LangChain Supervisor Pattern)

## üìå Overview

This architecture involves a **Supervisor Agent** that delegates tasks to **specialized Sub-Agents**, each focused on a domain like email, calendar, or contact management. The model supports **sequential** and **parallel** execution paths, boosting scalability, reusability, and reliability.

---

## üß± Architecture Components

### 1. **Supervisor Agent**
- Central controller that understands high-level user intent
- Delegates tasks to domain-specific sub-agents
- Can invoke agents **sequentially** or **in parallel**

### 2. **Sub-Agents**
- **Email Agent**: Handles Gmail-based operations (send/read/respond)
- **Contact Agent**: Retrieves contact info from CRM, Slack, etc.
- **Calendar Agent**: Manages event creation, updates, and lookups

---

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Workflow Example

### üßë‚Äçüíº Scenario: ‚ÄúSend John an email to schedule dinner at 7pm tomorrow.‚Äù

#### Step 1: Supervisor receives user input
- Parses intent and identifies task as a combo: contact lookup + email send

#### Step 2: Contact Agent invoked
- Resolves "John" to `john.doe@email.com`

#### Step 3: Email Agent triggered
- Composes and sends the email:  
  _"Hi John, are you free for dinner tomorrow at 7 PM?"_

#### Step 4: User follows up: ‚ÄúDid John respond?‚Äù
- Supervisor again:
  - Queries Contact Agent for email
  - Asks Email Agent to check replies
  - Parses John's response and returns it to user

#### Step 5: User requests: ‚ÄúSchedule the meeting and notify John.‚Äù
- **Parallel Execution** triggered:
  - Calendar Agent schedules event
  - Email Agent replies with confirmation

---

## üéØ Core Design Principles

### 1. **Specialization & Separation of Concerns**
- Each sub-agent handles one task domain (e.g., calendar ‚â† email ‚â† contacts)
- Easier to manage and maintain

### 2. **Reusability**
- Agents can be reused across different workflows
- E.g., same Contact Agent can serve both Email Agent and Supervisor

### 3. **Improved Transparency & Debugging**
- Problems localized to individual agents
- Easier logging, testing, and optimization

### 4. **Parallelization**
- Supervisor can execute agents concurrently for faster workflows
- Example: Calendar & Email Agent invoked at the same time

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Tips

### Agent Tool Configuration
- Each sub-agent points to its own **LangChain Tool** or **custom workflow**
- Use `.tool` abstraction to wrap each agent

### Prompt Engineering
- Keep prompts simple and domain-specific
- Avoid bloating context with multi-domain responsibilities

### Execution Logic
- Use if-else or planning models to decide:
  - When to run in sequence
  - When to fork processes in parallel

# https://www.youtube.com/watch/Ah-1-Lda4DU

Based on the video transcript **"Don't Build Another AI Agent Until You See This: Langchain‚Äôs Multi-Agent Architecture"**, here's a detailed, structured **Markdown guide** that outlines the **steps and design principles** needed to build a scalable, maintainable AI agent architecture using a **Supervisor‚ÄìSub-Agent** model.
the multi-agent architecture in Langchain, where a supervisor agent delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents [00:06].

Here's a summary:

Architecture Overview: The supervisor agent intelligently breaks down tasks and assigns them to sub-agents, either sequentially or in parallel [00:13].
Demonstration: The video showcases a system built with this architecture, contrasting it with a system built without it [00:33].
Example Agents: The demo includes an email agent for Gmail queries, a contact agent for retrieving contacts, and a calendar agent for calendar-related tasks [01:18].
Workflow Template: The presenter provides a workflow template available in their School community [02:17].
Benefits of the Architecture:
Specialization: Each agent focuses on a specific task, improving accuracy [07:34].
Reusability: Agents can be reused across different workflows [09:50].
Transparency: Easier to identify and resolve issues [11:26].
Parallelization: Tasks can be executed simultaneously for faster processing [12:42].
Broader Applications: The concepts apply to general AI workflows, not just AI agents [13:31].

00:00:00.000 hey guys so today we are looking at this
00:00:01.520 multi- aent architecture that Langchain
00:00:03.520 calls the supervisor and in this
00:00:06.000 architecture we have a supervisor agent
00:00:08.480 that is connected to multiple sub aents
00:00:10.960 which are specialized in a particular
00:00:12.960 domain the supervisor is able to break
00:00:15.440 down tasks intelligently and delegate
00:00:18.000 them to designated agents and it's able
00:00:20.480 to do it either by sequentially calling
00:00:22.720 these agents one by one or calling them
00:00:25.199 at the same time to process the requests
00:00:27.439 parallelly depending upon the task at
00:00:29.760 hand and we'll see both of these
00:00:31.599 examples in just a minute so to
00:00:33.440 demonstrate this architecture I have
00:00:35.040 these two examples prepared where in one
00:00:37.200 of them I built a system using this
00:00:39.680 architecture and in the second example
00:00:42.079 we have the same exact system built
00:00:44.640 without using this architecture so I'm
00:00:46.640 going to first demonstrate the system
00:00:48.079 with the architecture and once I'm done
00:00:50.079 we're going to talk about the
00:00:51.360 differences between these two which are
00:00:53.840 actually tremendous so in my opinion I
00:00:56.079 think it's definitely something you
00:00:57.680 should know especially if you work with
00:00:59.359 AI agents specifically but this is also
00:01:01.840 something you should know if you are
00:01:03.199 someone who is building AI based
00:01:04.879 workflows in any way since this is a
00:01:06.880 foundational concept related to LLMs in
00:01:09.280 general but anyway without wasting any
00:01:10.960 more time let's just get to the demo all
00:01:12.400 right so let's first quickly take a look
00:01:13.760 at what we have here as you can see we
00:01:15.920 have a supervisor agent and then we have
00:01:18.640 three sub agents that are connected to
00:01:20.400 it just like what we had in the diagram
00:01:22.960 right the first agent we have is an
00:01:24.799 email agent which is only responsible
00:01:26.640 for Gmail based queries then we have a
00:01:29.360 contact agent in this case I passed it
00:01:31.600 two code tools to simulate retrieval of
00:01:34.079 contacts from different platforms in
00:01:36.079 this case we have CRM contacts and then
00:01:38.159 we have Slack contacts which might not
00:01:39.840 even make sense in a real world scenario
00:01:41.520 but like I said just to simulate
00:01:43.759 complexity the only contact here that is
00:01:46.320 real in the sense that the email is
00:01:48.159 legit belongs to John Doe right where
00:01:51.119 the email points to my own old email and
00:01:54.320 this is what we're going to be using in
00:01:55.680 this example then the next agent we have
00:01:57.680 here is the calendar agent and by now
00:01:59.280 you can already imagine that this agent
00:02:00.799 is only responsible for calendarbased
00:02:03.600 queries right with that we have our
00:02:06.479 architecture here so the supervisor
00:02:08.399 agent here knows how to interact with
00:02:10.080 these sub aents in order to complete a
00:02:12.480 user request and with that we can start
00:02:14.720 with our example but before we do I want
00:02:16.959 to let you know that I'm going to be
00:02:18.239 uploading this workflow template here to
00:02:21.040 my school community which is completely
00:02:23.040 free by the way and we are at 2K members
00:02:25.120 at the moment once you're in you can
00:02:26.560 just head to the YouTube video and
00:02:28.080 resources section where you can find all
00:02:30.080 the resources that I show in my videos
00:02:31.840 in this case the last video I posted was
00:02:33.760 on MCP which I also shared the workflow
00:02:36.879 template here right it's a JSON file and
00:02:39.360 what you'll have to do is just download
00:02:40.879 this file here and then go back to the
00:02:42.560 workflow that you want to import this
00:02:44.560 template into and you'll see this three
00:02:46.879 dotted button here just click on that
00:02:48.480 and then click on import from file and
00:02:50.720 once you select the file that you just
00:02:52.160 downloaded you would have imported the
00:02:53.599 workflow and that's how simple it is all
00:02:55.200 right so let's spin up a chat window to
00:02:57.040 chat with our supervisor agent right and
00:02:59.760 I'm going to tell it to please send an
00:03:03.120 email to John and let him or and ask him
00:03:07.519 if he is okay for a dinner meeting
00:03:11.760 tomorrow at 700 p.m for an hour okay I'm
00:03:15.680 going to click on that and let's see
00:03:18.159 what happens then you can see that it
00:03:20.800 first hits the contacts agent to get the
00:03:23.440 email for John right since we don't
00:03:24.959 specify to it here it's processing it
00:03:27.519 now got the information for his email
00:03:29.680 and after that the supervisor agent
00:03:31.360 passed it to the email agent to send off
00:03:33.680 the email and what we see here is the
00:03:35.680 sequential way of processing a request
00:03:38.560 from the one we discussed earlier where
00:03:40.400 we have two kinds sequential and
00:03:42.480 parallel in this case we went with
00:03:44.400 sequential since we first hit the
00:03:46.239 contact agent and then we hit the email
00:03:48.480 agent to send off the email and we can
00:03:51.120 see here it says I have sent an email to
00:03:52.959 John Do asking if he's available let's
00:03:54.720 take a look at if that's the case i'm
00:03:56.879 going to go to my inbox here and we can
00:03:59.360 see that indeed it did send us an email
00:04:01.519 and I'm just going to go ahead and
00:04:02.959 respond with one of these templates here
00:04:05.439 i'm going to say yes I'm available and
00:04:07.280 I'm going to click on respond and go
00:04:08.879 back to the agent and ask it the
00:04:10.799 follow-up question and say did John
00:04:13.040 respond okay did John respond like this
00:04:16.238 and with the hope that we did receive
00:04:17.680 the email I'm going to click on enter
00:04:19.199 again and let's see what happens this
00:04:20.798 time we have our supervisor processing
00:04:22.639 the request that hits the contact agent
00:04:25.440 again to get the email for John just
00:04:28.080 like it was instructed and now it's
00:04:29.680 processing the email and here we can see
00:04:31.360 that John replied and he's available for
00:04:33.120 the dinner meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.m
00:04:35.040 which is perfect right now I'm going to
00:04:36.880 tell it to do two things i'm going to
00:04:38.840 say great by the way the comma key is
00:04:41.759 not working guys so I'm going to use
00:04:43.199 full stop in its place so uh please
00:04:45.520 don't mind me
00:04:50.720 and let's see what it does this time
00:04:53.040 again the supervisor processes it goes
00:04:55.600 to the context agent as it's it was
00:04:57.520 instructed right so the context agent
00:04:59.440 returns the context and you can see how
00:05:01.600 this time we use the parallel processing
00:05:03.759 method where it hit both of these agents
00:05:06.160 at the same time so they are both
00:05:08.160 parallelly processing the request the
00:05:10.000 calendar agent already did its thing now
00:05:11.759 we're waiting for the email agent to
00:05:13.440 also do its thing let's see what happens
00:05:15.360 all right guys so it says the dinner
00:05:16.560 meeting with John has been scheduled for
00:05:18.320 tomorrow at 7:00 p.m and he has been
00:05:20.160 tagged in the event let's take a look at
00:05:21.919 if that's the case and we can see here
00:05:23.600 that that indeed is the case we have a
00:05:25.919 meeting set for tomorrow at 7:00 p.m
00:05:28.240 called dinner meeting with John Doe and
00:05:30.160 you can see the guest here is of course
00:05:32.880 the real owner of this email is me so
00:05:34.880 it's my name here but you can see that
00:05:36.160 it used the correct email right with
00:05:38.160 that let's check if it was able to
00:05:39.919 respond to our email and you can see
00:05:42.080 that it not only created a new email and
00:05:44.639 sent it to John or to us it actually
00:05:47.360 responded to John's email and said "Hi
00:05:50.160 John the dinner meeting has been
00:05:51.440 scheduled for tomorrow 7 at 7:00 p.m
00:05:53.840 best regards Mood." Again this format
00:05:55.759 could be fixed so it was able to do what
00:05:57.360 we told it to do right and that's pretty
00:05:59.440 much this architecture here we saw how
00:06:02.560 we have a supervisor agent that
00:06:04.479 intelligently delegates tasks to its sub
00:06:07.120 agents right in this case we had a
00:06:09.120 contact agent that was always called by
00:06:10.880 our supervisor to get the contact for a
00:06:13.199 particular user in this case John then
00:06:14.960 it used the email agent to send an email
00:06:17.120 or to see if John responded to our email
00:06:20.080 and then created a calendar using the
00:06:22.240 calendar agent and at one point it used
00:06:24.720 both of these agents parallelly so we
00:06:26.960 had two agents working at the same time
00:06:28.639 to process different parts of that task
00:06:31.120 which they were able to do successfully
00:06:32.800 and just a heads up by the way I didn't
00:06:34.560 really work on the prompt since this is
00:06:36.240 just an example to demonstrate the
00:06:38.560 architecture to you guys and one more
00:06:40.720 thing you guys might be wondering that I
00:06:42.319 forgot to explain is what's really going
00:06:44.400 on here since it's hitting these agents
00:06:46.319 but we don't see these agents doing
00:06:48.080 anything right the reason is because I
00:06:50.080 added these here just to help you
00:06:51.919 visualize what's going on under the hood
00:06:54.080 otherwise what's happening is we are
00:06:55.759 using this tool to point to the actual
00:06:57.680 instances of these agents for instance
00:06:59.440 in this case we have a calendar agent
00:07:01.840 tool what it does is it points to a
00:07:04.639 workflow that is called calendar agent
00:07:07.120 and it's over here right which contains
00:07:09.759 the actual instance of this agent and we
00:07:12.000 have the same thing for contact agent
00:07:14.160 and then for the email agent so that's
00:07:16.319 what was happening under the hood in
00:07:18.000 reality but like I said I added here to
00:07:20.160 visualize what's going on right now
00:07:22.080 let's take a look at the benefits of
00:07:24.080 this architecture and for this let's
00:07:26.080 take a look at the diagram again and
00:07:27.919 underneath we have this benefits section
00:07:30.080 here let's start looking at each of them
00:07:31.599 one by one and I'll be elaborating on
00:07:33.360 each of them as we go so the first one
00:07:34.880 is specialization and separation of
00:07:36.639 concerns each agent is responsible for a
00:07:38.960 specific task reducing the scope of
00:07:40.919 responsibility leading to better
00:07:42.720 accuracy basically saying that instead
00:07:45.199 of dumping everything into a single
00:07:47.360 agent what we do is we create
00:07:49.280 specialized agents that are only
00:07:51.120 responsible in a particular domain and
00:07:54.479 what it means by separation of concerns
00:07:56.879 is that each of these agents are only
00:07:59.199 concerned about what they are
00:08:01.360 responsible for doing right the calendar
00:08:03.360 agent does not care about how to send an
00:08:06.000 email or how to manage contacts it only
00:08:08.479 solely cares about how to handle
00:08:10.479 calendarbased queries and it's the exact
00:08:12.400 same thing for these other two agents
00:08:14.240 here where they are only concerned about
00:08:16.160 whatever domain they are specialized in
00:08:18.639 so that's what's meant by separation of
00:08:20.479 concerns right and when you think about
00:08:22.319 it there's a lot of things going on
00:08:24.319 fundamentally speaking because here we
00:08:26.319 have an agent that's been given all
00:08:28.160 sorts of things from all sorts of
00:08:29.840 domains like we have three different
00:08:31.280 domains that this agent has to focus on
00:08:33.679 which you can imagine makes it much more
00:08:36.080 difficult for this agent to perform
00:08:38.479 accurately and not make mistakes because
00:08:40.799 when we when we pass in these tools like
00:08:43.120 this in the way that we see it what's
00:08:45.200 going under the hood is a much more
00:08:47.200 different story where each of these gets
00:08:49.360 added into the context window for the
00:08:51.680 agent to have to process right each
00:08:53.600 tools have its own description own input
00:08:56.240 schema and all sorts of things that this
00:08:58.560 agent has to understand before deciding
00:09:00.720 on which tools to use adding different
00:09:02.880 domains to it is just making it worse
00:09:04.959 adding more options to it is just again
00:09:06.880 making it more difficult for the agent
00:09:08.959 to decide more accurately apart from
00:09:11.360 that we have prompt engineering for
00:09:13.040 these kind of agents as you can imagine
00:09:14.959 gets much more difficult this is an
00:09:16.880 example I created on how it might look
00:09:19.040 like for an agent that's supposed to
00:09:21.519 handle all sorts of things like trying
00:09:23.839 to at least get it to do it consistently
00:09:26.320 right and this is a simple example
00:09:28.160 normally we have things like examples to
00:09:30.399 allow the agent to understand how it
00:09:31.839 should behave and it just makes it more
00:09:33.839 difficult for both the developer that
00:09:36.320 maintains this agent and for the agent
00:09:38.240 itself to perform accurately and not
00:09:40.720 make mistakes so this is one of the
00:09:42.640 problems that this architecture tackles
00:09:45.279 and it does it really well in my opinion
00:09:47.600 so with that let's continue with the
00:09:49.600 second item in the list which is
00:09:51.279 reusability agents can be reused across
00:09:53.760 different workflows and context without
00:09:55.760 duplication and this is also very true i
00:09:58.800 actually demonstrated it in this example
00:10:00.399 but I haven't yet explained so we have
00:10:02.160 this context agent right and if you
00:10:03.920 notice again let me just pull this down
00:10:05.519 to so that we can see it better if you
00:10:07.600 notice what we have here is the contact
00:10:09.440 agent and this context agent is being
00:10:11.600 used by both the supervisor agent and
00:10:14.320 the email agent right and I added this
00:10:16.079 just to demonstrate that we can reuse
00:10:18.399 this in different parts of the workflow
00:10:20.240 or even in different workflows itself
00:10:23.120 like where it could be a part of a
00:10:24.640 different project and the good part
00:10:26.240 about this is because we are
00:10:28.160 specializing these agents what's
00:10:30.000 happening is they're only focused on a
00:10:32.160 single unit of work they're not focused
00:10:33.839 in multiple different domains so it
00:10:35.680 makes it easier for us to reuse them in
00:10:38.560 also different projects so you can just
00:10:40.320 prepare these agents once and just plug
00:10:43.200 and play them in different projects if
00:10:45.360 you'd like we also did it here the email
00:10:47.279 agent is also able to call the contact
00:10:49.680 agent to make sure it has the right
00:10:52.560 contact information but in cases where
00:10:55.040 we have an agent that has all these
00:10:57.160 responsibilities imagine in another
00:10:59.279 project or even in this project for this
00:11:01.279 email agent here for instance right if
00:11:03.519 that project just requires the contact
00:11:05.440 information you don't want to give it
00:11:07.120 this whole agent as that would be an
00:11:09.120 overkill like it's only concerned or
00:11:11.360 it's only interested in these two things
00:11:13.360 where it's trying to get the CRM based
00:11:15.600 contacts and Slackbased contacts and the
00:11:18.000 project does not want anything to do
00:11:19.519 with handling calendars or Gmail right
00:11:22.480 so this is what it means by reusability
00:11:24.959 and then we have improved transparency
00:11:26.880 and debugging process which is really
00:11:29.040 true so it becomes easier to identify
00:11:31.680 and resolve issues because the overall
00:11:33.760 task is divided into smaller units
00:11:36.000 handled by multiple agents so what it
00:11:38.240 means here is that as we break down the
00:11:40.800 responsibilities for these agents we are
00:11:42.880 also essentially breaking down the
00:11:44.720 problems themselves into simpler units
00:11:47.200 because if a problem occurs in this
00:11:49.279 personal assistant the first problem is
00:11:51.760 having to figure out where exactly this
00:11:53.920 problem occurred like you'll have to go
00:11:55.279 into this context trying to understand
00:11:57.040 what caused the problem let's say in the
00:11:59.120 case where it tried to create a calendar
00:12:01.600 event and then send an email you would
00:12:03.440 have to go through this whole prompt
00:12:05.440 here and understand what to change in
00:12:07.839 order to fix these two-step problem and
00:12:10.480 chances are because these are mangled in
00:12:12.639 together where the logic is intertwined
00:12:15.200 fixing one thing here might break
00:12:17.279 something in the bottom and it's just
00:12:19.519 going to make it much more complicated
00:12:21.279 for the developer again and this is what
00:12:24.160 this architecture here solves really
00:12:25.920 well now imagine if the same problem
00:12:27.519 occurred in this architecture here we
00:12:29.600 would be able to easily pinpoint where
00:12:31.680 the problem arises in by looking at
00:12:33.600 which agent is causing the issue right
00:12:35.600 and then we would just go in there and
00:12:37.440 fix it directly wherever it arises in so
00:12:39.920 that's how this architecture helps us
00:12:41.760 with debugging and improving
00:12:43.920 transparency and the last one here is
00:12:45.760 parallelization being able to execute
00:12:47.839 task parallelly and this is what we saw
00:12:50.160 when we wanted to send an email and also
00:12:52.959 schedule an event with John where the
00:12:55.760 agent called both of these agents the
00:12:58.079 calendar agent and the email agent to
00:13:00.560 complete the request the calendar agent
00:13:02.560 was scheduling an event while on the
00:13:04.800 other side simultaneously the email
00:13:06.959 agent was preparing the email to send to
00:13:09.279 him instead of having to do it
00:13:10.560 sequentially so the supervisor agent can
00:13:12.880 decide on cases where it wants to call
00:13:15.440 these agents one by one or like in this
00:13:18.160 case call them at the same time to
00:13:20.160 increase the speed of the whole process
00:13:21.920 all right guys with that we are done
00:13:23.200 with this video i hope you're able to
00:13:25.200 get value from this video and understand
00:13:27.200 why it's important to implement these
00:13:28.959 kind of architectures into our workflows
00:13:31.279 again it doesn't even have to be for AI
00:13:33.120 agents right these concepts
00:13:35.120 fundamentally apply to anything related
00:13:37.440 to AI in terms of LLMs in general right
00:13:40.639 even if you have a workflow with
00:13:42.560 standard predefined steps you can still
00:13:44.800 improve their performance by limiting
00:13:46.639 the scope of responsibility they each
00:13:48.800 have and I also showed that in my
00:13:50.560 previous video with effective agents
00:13:52.480 anyway so you can check that out if you
00:13:54.160 haven't yet it's a really good video in
00:13:56.000 my opinion it's actually my most watched
00:13:57.920 video anyway guys again you can also
00:14:00.399 join my school community to get access
00:14:02.320 to the resources shown in this video and
00:14:04.240 all the other videos right that video
00:14:06.240 for the effective agents is here by the
00:14:08.160 way so you can just come over here and
00:14:09.680 download this workflow here but anyway
00:14:11.360 if you enjoyed this video please leave a
00:14:13.120 like or a comment as it really helps me
00:14:15.440 reach out to more people with my videos
00:14:17.440 so thank you in advance bye
