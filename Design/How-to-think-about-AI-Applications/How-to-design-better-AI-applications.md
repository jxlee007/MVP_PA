# Designing Better AI Applications

## 🎯 Overview

This discussion between **Pete Kumman** and the interviewer explores how most current AI product implementations are **missing the mark**, and how founders can design **next-generation AI applications** that truly leverage the technology's potential.

## ❌ The Problem with Existing AI Implementations

### 1. **Disappointing User Experiences**  
> “Using AI in Gmail to draft emails is frustrating, unlike using purpose-built tools like Cursor or Windsurf.” — [00:59], [01:25]

- Most current apps bolt AI features onto legacy UI and workflows.
- This leads to shallow integrations and poor user experiences.

---

## 🐎 The "AI Horseless Carriage" Problem  
> “AI features are being grafted onto legacy paradigms—like early cars that looked like carriages.” — [10:47]

- Many tools replicate old software logic, limiting AI's impact.
- True innovation requires **rethinking interfaces and workflows** from the ground up with AI at the core.

---

## ✏️ The Case for User-Editable System Prompts  
> “Let users see and modify the prompts that drive AI behavior.” — [08:07], [08:36]

- System prompts are the new "codebase" of AI products.
- Giving users control creates **personalization** and **higher utility**.
- Example: Custom prompts for writing emails significantly improve relevance and tone.

---

## 🔁 Redefining the Developer-User Relationship  
> “The old model keeps code hidden—AI lets users program behavior with natural language.” — [09:30], [14:15]

- AI enables **user-driven logic configuration**.
- Users can steer application behavior by adjusting prompts or goals.
- This creates a more **interactive**, **user-centric** development paradigm.

---

## 🛠️ Agents Need Tools, Not Just Text  
> “AI agents must interact with the real world, not just generate words.” — [26:17], [26:23]

- Successful agents need:
  - APIs for apps (email, Slack, calendar)
  - File management tools
  - External database access
  - Workflow automation support
- Pure text generation ≠ real productivity

---

## 💬 Beyond Chatbots  
> “Slapping a chatbot onto your product isn’t the future of AI.” — [28:28]

- Most chatbot UIs are insufficient for actual task execution.
- AI needs to be embedded in **core workflows**, not added as a support feature.

---

## 🧠 Design Software Natively for AI  
> “Don’t retrofit old tools. Build AI-native systems that automate repetitive work.” — [29:22]

- Founders should rethink software categories:
  - What would this tool look like if AI did 80% of the work?
  - Where can automation be default?
  - How can natural language replace manual configuration?

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Stop retrofitting. Start reinventing.**
- **Empower users** by exposing and editable system-level instructions (prompts).
- **Shift from chat to action** — agents need tools and integration, not just conversation.
- **Design AI-first interfaces** that focus on automation, outcomes, and simplicity.
