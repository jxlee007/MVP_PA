Transliteration converts text from one script to another while preserving the original pronunciation. For example, ‘नमस्ते’ becomes ‘namaste’ in English, and ‘how are you’ can be written as ‘हाउ आर यू’ in Devanagari. This process ensures that the sound of the original text remains intact, even when written in a different script.

Transliteration is useful when you want to represent words phonetically across different writing systems, such as converting ‘मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ’ to ‘main office ja raha hun’ in English letters.

Translation, on the other hand, converts text from one language to another while preserving the meaning rather than pronunciation. For example, ‘मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ’ translates to ‘I am going to the office’ in English, changing both the script and the language while conveying the intended message.

Examples of Transliteration:
‘Good morning’ becomes ‘गुड मॉर्निंग’ in Hindi, where the pronunciation is preserved but the meaning is not translated.
‘सुप्रभात’ becomes ‘suprabhat’ in English.
