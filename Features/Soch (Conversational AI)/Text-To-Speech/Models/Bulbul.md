  <Tab title="Sample Rate">
    Choose the audio quality that best fits your needs. Higher sample rates provide better quality but larger file sizes.
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        # Control audio quality with sample rate
        response = client.text_to_speech.convert(
            text="Hello, how are you today?",
            target_language_code="en-IN",

        }'
        ````
</Tab>
</Tabs>

    <Note>
    Higher sample rates provide better audio quality but result in larger file sizes:
    - 8000 Hz: Basic telephony quality
    - 16000 Hz: Good quality voice
    - 22050 Hz: Default high-quality audio
    - 24000 Hz: Premium audio quality

  <Tab title="Text Preprocessing">
    Enable smart text normalization to improve pronunciation of numbers, dates, and mixed-language content. Essential for handling complex text inputs.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        # Enable smart text preprocessing
        response = client.text_to_speech.convert(
           text="The price is Rs. 1,00,000 on 25th December, 2024",
            target_language_code="en-IN",
            enable_preprocessing=True  # Handles numbers, dates, and mixed text
        )
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        // Enable smart text preprocessing
        const response = await client.textToSpeech.convert({
          text: 'The price is Rs. 1,00,000 on 25th December, 2024',
          target_language_code: 'en-IN',
          enable_preprocessing: true  // Handles numbers, dates, and mixed text
        });
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="cURL">

-H "api-subscription-key: <YOUR_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"text":"Welcome to Sarvam AI!",
"target_language_code": "en-IN",
"enable_preprocessing::True
}'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

    <Note>
    Text preprocessing improves pronunciation by handling:
    - Numbers and currencies (e.g., "Rs. 1,00,000" → "rupees one lakh")
    - Dates (e.g., "25th December, 2024" → "twenty-fifth December two thousand twenty-four")
    - Mixed-language text normalization
    - Common abbreviations and symbols
