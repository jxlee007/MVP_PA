# Integration Architecture
## Cross-Module Intelligence & API Design

**Last Updated**: June 4, 2025  
**Architecture Pattern**: Event-Driven + Shared Context  
**Integration Strategy**: Unified AI with Module Specialization

---

## 🏗️ **Integration Overview**

AssistantPro's power comes from its integrated architecture where three specialized modules (Soch, Mudra, Sikshak) share a unified AI foundation while maintaining clear separation of concerns. This document outlines how modules communicate, share context, and provide seamless user experiences.

---

## 🧠 **Core Integration Principles**

### **1. Shared AI Foundation (Soch as Platform)**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Soch AI Platform                         │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Sarvam AI   │  │ Cultural    │  │ Context Manager     │  │
│  │ Integration │  │ Intelligence│  │                     │  │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │ (Shared AI Context)
    ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
    │                 │                 │
┌───▼────┐    ┌──────▼──────┐    ┌─────▼──────┐
│ Mudra  │    │    User     │    │  Sikshak   │
│(Finance)│   │ Interface   │    │(Education) │
└────────┘    └─────────────┘    └────────────┘
```

### **2. Context Sharing Architecture**
```typescript
interface UnifiedAIContext {
  // Core Identity
  tenantId: string;
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  
  // Conversation State
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  currentIntent: Intent;
  lastInteractionTime: Date;
  
  // Cultural Profile
  culturalProfile: {
    primaryLanguage: 'hi' | 'en' | string;
    culturalMarkers: CulturalMarker[];
    formalityLevel: 'formal' | 'casual' | 'intimate';
    regionalContext: RegionalContext;
  };
  
  // Module-Specific Context
  mudraContext?: FinancialContext;
  sikshakContext?: EducationalContext;
  
  // Cross-Module Intelligence
  crossModuleInsights: ModuleInsight[];
  personalityProfile: PersonalityProfile;
}
```

---

## 🔄 **Module Integration Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: AI-Mediated Cross-Module Communication**

```typescript
class CrossModuleOrchestrator {
  async processUserInput(input: UserInput): Promise<AIResponse> {
    // 1. Soch processes the input with full context
    const aiAnalysis = await this.sochAI.analyze(input, this.getFullContext());
    
    // 2. Determine which module(s) should handle the request
    const targetModules = this.determineTargetModules(aiAnalysis);
    
    // 3. Execute module-specific actions
    const moduleResponses = await Promise.all(
      targetModules.map(module => this.executeModuleAction(module, aiAnalysis))
    );
    
    // 4. Soch synthesizes the final response
    return this.sochAI.synthesizeResponse(moduleResponses, this.getFullContext());
  }
  
  private determineTargetModules(analysis: AIAnalysis): Module[] {
    const modules: Module[] = [];
    
    // Financial intent detection
    if (analysis.intent.category === 'financial') {
      modules.push(Module.MUDRA);
    }
    
    // Educational intent detection
    if (analysis.intent.category === 'educational') {
      modules.push(Module.SIKSHAK);
    }
    
    // Cross-module scenarios
    if (analysis.intent.type === 'financial_education') {
      modules.push(Module.MUDRA, Module.SIKSHAK);
    }
    
    return modules;
  }
}
```

### **Pattern 2: Event-Driven Module Communication**

```typescript
// Event system for module coordination
class ModuleEventBus {
  private eventHandlers = new Map<string, EventHandler[]>();
  
  // Mudra publishes financial events
  publishFinancialEvent(event: FinancialEvent): void {
    this.emit('financial.transaction.detected', {
      userId: event.userId,
      transaction: event.transaction,
      culturalContext: event.culturalContext
    });
  }
  
  // Sikshak subscribes to financial events for educational opportunities
  onFinancialEvent(handler: (event: FinancialEvent) => void): void {
    this.on('financial.transaction.detected', async (event) => {
      // Educational opportunity detection
      const educationalTrigger = await this.detectEducationalOpportunity(event);
      if (educationalTrigger) {
        await handler(educationalTrigger);
      }
    });
  }
  
  private async detectEducationalOpportunity(event: FinancialEvent): Promise<EducationalTrigger | null> {
    // Example: High spending detected -> budget education opportunity
    if (event.transaction.amount > event.user.monthlyBudget * 0.1) {
      return {
        type: 'budget_education',
        urgency: 'high',
        context: event,
        suggestedContent: ['budgeting_basics', 'expense_tracking']
      };
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

## 💰 **Mudra-Soch Integration**

### **Financial Intelligence Pipeline**

```typescript
class MudraIntegration {
  constructor(private sochAI: SochAIService) {}
  
  // SMS Transaction Processing with AI
  async processSMSTransaction(sms: SMSMessage): Promise<Transaction | null> {
    // 1. Soch analyzes SMS with cultural context
    const analysis = await this.sochAI.analyzeSMS(sms, {
      language: 'hi',
      context: 'financial',
      bankFormats: this.getBankSMSFormats()
    });
    
    if (!analysis.isFinancial) return null;
    
    // 2. Extract transaction details using AI
    const transaction = await this.extractTransactionDetails(analysis);
    
    // 3. AI-powered categorization with cultural awareness
    const category = await this.sochAI.categorizeTransaction(transaction, {
      culturalContext: await this.getUserCulturalContext(transaction.userId),
      historicalPatterns: await this.getTransactionHistory(transaction.userId)
    });
    
    // 4. Store with enriched context
    return this.storeTransaction({
      ...transaction,
      category,
      culturalMarkers: analysis.culturalMarkers,
      confidence: analysis.confidence
    });
  }
  
  // Voice Financial Commands
  async processVoiceFinancialCommand(audio: AudioBuffer, userId: string): Promise<FinancialResponse> {
    // 1. Soch converts speech to text with financial context
    const transcription = await this.sochAI.speechToText(audio, {
      domain: 'financial',
      language: 'hi',
      vocabulary: this.getFinancialVocabulary()
    });
    
    // 2. Intent detection with cultural understanding
    const intent = await this.sochAI.detectIntent(transcription.text, {
      domain: 'financial',
      culturalContext: await this.getUserCulturalContext(userId)
    });
    
    // 3. Execute financial action
    const result = await this.executeFinancialAction(intent, userId);
    
    // 4. Generate culturally-appropriate response
    const responseText = await this.sochAI.generateResponse(result, {
      responseType: 'financial_confirmation',
      culturalContext: await this.getUserCulturalContext(userId),
      formality: intent.formality
    });
    
    // 5. Convert to speech
    const audioResponse = await this.sochAI.textToSpeech(responseText, {
      language: intent.language,
      emotion: 'helpful',
      speed: 'normal'
    });
    
    return {
      textResponse: responseText,
      audioResponse,
      actionResult: result,
      confidence: intent.confidence
    };
  }
}
```

### **Financial Context Sharing**

```typescript
interface FinancialContext {
  // Current Financial State
  monthlyIncome: number;
  monthlyExpenses: number;
  currentBalance: number;
  
  // Spending Patterns
  topCategories: CategorySpending[];
  spendingTrends: SpendingTrend[];
  budgetStatus: BudgetStatus;
  
  // Cultural Financial Behavior
  festivalSpending: FestivalSpending[];
  familyFinancialGoals: FinancialGoal[];
  investmentPreferences: InvestmentPreference[];
  
  // AI Learning Data
  categoryConfidence: Record<string, number>;
  merchantMappings: MerchantMapping[];
  languagePreferences: LanguagePreference[];
}
```

## 📚 **Sikshak-Soch Integration**

### **Educational Intelligence Pipeline**

```typescript
class SikshakIntegration {
  constructor(private sochAI: SochAIService, private mudraService: MudraService) {}
  
  // Adaptive Learning with Cultural Context
  async createPersonalizedLesson(topic: string, userId: string): Promise<LessonPlan> {
    // 1. Get user's cultural and educational context
    const context = await this.getUserContext(userId);
    
    // 2. AI generates culturally-appropriate content
    const lessonContent = await this.sochAI.generateEducationalContent(topic, {
      ageGroup: context.ageGroup,
      culturalBackground: context.culturalProfile,
      learningStyle: context.learningPreferences,
      language: context.primaryLanguage
    });
    
    // 3. Integrate real financial data for practical examples
    const financialExamples = await this.getRelevantFinancialExamples(userId, topic);
    
    // 4. Create interactive lesson with voice support
    return {
      content: lessonContent,
      practicalExamples: financialExamples,
      voiceInstructions: await this.generateVoiceInstructions(lessonContent, context),
      culturallyRelevantMetaphors: await this.generateCulturalMetaphors(topic, context),
      assessmentQuestions: await this.generateAssessment(topic, context)
    };
  }
  
  // Financial Literacy with Real Data
  async createFinancialLiteracyLesson(userId: string): Promise<FinancialLiteracyLesson> {
    // 1. Get user's actual financial data (anonymized)
    const financialData = await this.mudraService.getAnonymizedFinancialSummary(userId);
    
    // 2. AI analyzes spending patterns for educational opportunities
    const learningOpportunities = await this.sochAI.identifyLearningOpportunities(financialData, {
      culturalContext: await this.getUserCulturalContext(userId),
      ageGroup: await this.getUserAgeGroup(userId)
    });
    
    // 3. Generate practical lessons using real data
    const lessons = await Promise.all(
      learningOpportunities.map(opportunity => 
        this.generatePracticalLesson(opportunity, financialData)
      )
    );
    
    return {
      personalizedLessons: lessons,
      realDataInsights: financialData.insights,
      actionableAdvice: await this.generateActionableAdvice(financialData),
      culturallyRelevantTips: await this.generateCulturalFinancialTips(userId)
    };
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Cross-Module Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Voice Financial Query with Educational Response**

```typescript
// User: "इस महीने मैंने कितना खर्च किया?" (How much did I spend this month?)
async handleFinancialEducationQuery(query: VoiceQuery): Promise<IntegratedResponse> {
  // 1. Soch processes the voice input
  const analysis = await this.sochAI.analyzeVoiceQuery(query, {
    expectedDomains: ['financial', 'educational'],
    culturalContext: query.userContext.culturalProfile
  });
  
  // 2. Mudra provides financial data
  const financialData = await this.mudraService.getMonthlySpending(query.userId);
  
  // 3. Sikshak identifies educational opportunity
  const educationalInsight = await this.sikshakService.analyzeSpendingForEducation(
    financialData, 
    query.userContext
  );
  
  // 4. Soch synthesizes integrated response
  const response = await this.sochAI.generateIntegratedResponse({
    financial: financialData,
    educational: educationalInsight,
    culturalContext: query.userContext.culturalProfile,
    responseStyle: 'helpful_teacher'
  });
  
  return {
    textResponse: response.text,
    audioResponse: await this.sochAI.textToSpeech(response.text, query.userContext),
    visualData: financialData.charts,
    educationalTips: educationalInsight.tips,
    followUpQuestions: response.followUp
  };
}
```

### **Scenario 2: Educational Session with Financial Planning**

```typescript
// During a financial literacy lesson, use real expense data
async integrateFinancialDataInEducation(lessonId: string, userId: string): Promise<EnhancedLesson> {
  // 1. Get base educational content
  const baseLesson = await this.sikshakService.getLesson(lessonId);
  
  // 2. Get relevant financial data from Mudra
  const financialContext = await this.mudraService.getEducationalFinancialContext(userId);
  
  // 3. Soch creates personalized examples
  const personalizedExamples = await this.sochAI.createPersonalizedExamples(
    baseLesson.topic,
    financialContext,
    {
      culturalContext: await this.getUserCulturalContext(userId),
      simplificationLevel: baseLesson.difficulty
    }
  );
  
  // 4. Generate interactive scenarios
  const interactiveScenarios = await this.generateInteractiveScenarios(
    baseLesson,
    financialContext,
    personalizedExamples
  );
  
  return {
    ...baseLesson,
    personalizedExamples,
    interactiveScenarios,
    realDataInsights: financialContext.insights,
    practicalExercises: await this.generatePracticalExercises(financialContext)
  };
}
```

## 🔌 **API Integration Architecture**

### **Internal API Design**

```typescript
// Unified internal API for module communication
class InternalAPIGateway {
  private modules = {
    soch: new SochAIService(),
    mudra: new MudraService(),
    sikshak: new SikshakService()
  };
  
  // Cross-module request handling
  async handleCrossModuleRequest(request: CrossModuleRequest): Promise<any> {
    const { sourceModule, targetModule, action, context } = request;
    
    // Security check: ensure modules are authorized to communicate
    if (!this.isAuthorizedCommunication(sourceModule, targetModule, action)) {
      throw new Error('Unauthorized cross-module communication');
    }
    
    // Context enrichment with AI
    const enrichedContext = await this.enrichContext(context);
    
    // Execute target module action
    const result = await this.modules[targetModule].executeAction(action, enrichedContext);
    
    // Log for analytics and debugging
    await this.logCrossModuleInteraction(request, result);
    
    return result;
  }
  
  // AI-powered context enrichment
  private async enrichContext(context: any): Promise<EnrichedContext> {
    return {
      ...context,
      culturalContext: await this.soch.getCulturalContext(context.userId),
      conversationHistory: await this.soch.getRecentConversation(context.userId),
      crossModuleInsights: await this.getCrossModuleInsights(context.userId)
    };
  }
}
```

### **External API Endpoints**

```typescript
// RESTful API for external integrations
@Controller('/api/v1')
export class IntegratedAPIController {
  
  @Post('/ai/unified-query')
  async processUnifiedQuery(@Body() request: UnifiedQueryRequest): Promise<UnifiedResponse> {
    // Process query across all relevant modules
    const response = await this.orchestrator.processUnifiedQuery(request);
    return response;
  }
  
  @Get('/context/:userId')
  async getUserContext(@Param('userId') userId: string): Promise<UnifiedContext> {
    // Get complete user context across all modules
    return this.contextManager.getUnifiedContext(userId);
  }
  
  @Post('/webhooks/financial-education')
  async handleFinancialEducationWebhook(@Body() webhook: FinancialWebhook): Promise<void> {
    // Trigger educational content based on financial events
    await this.sikshakService.triggerEducationalOpportunity(webhook);
  }
}
```

## 📊 **Performance & Monitoring**

### **Cross-Module Performance Monitoring**

```typescript
class IntegrationMonitoring {
  private metrics = {
    crossModuleLatency: new prometheus.Histogram({
      name: 'cross_module_request_duration_seconds',
      labelNames: ['source_module', 'target_module', 'action']
    }),
    
    contextEnrichmentTime: new prometheus.Histogram({
      name: 'context_enrichment_duration_seconds',
      labelNames: ['user_id', 'context_type']
    }),
    
    aiSynthesisAccuracy: new prometheus.Gauge({
      name: 'ai_response_synthesis_accuracy',
      labelNames: ['response_type', 'cultural_context']
    })
  };
  
  async monitorCrossModuleRequest(request: CrossModuleRequest, handler: Function): Promise<any> {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    try {
      const result = await handler();
      
      // Record success metrics
      this.metrics.crossModuleLatency
        .labels(request.sourceModule, request.targetModule, request.action)
        .observe((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000);
      
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Record error metrics
      this.recordError(request, error);

00:00:00.719 Welcome to Meet AI, a video calling app
00:00:04.480 powered entirely by AI agents. These
00:00:08.000 aren't just summaries or transcripts.
00:00:10.719 Every meeting here was an actual
00:00:13.040 real-time call with an AI trained for a
00:00:16.160 specific role. Whether it's a language
00:00:18.560 tutor, interview coach, sales assistant,
00:00:21.600 or something completely custom, the AI
00:00:24.240 is there to actively help during the
00:00:26.400 call. To start a new call with an AI
00:00:29.279 agent, I click on the new meeting
00:00:31.559 button. I'm going to name this one
00:00:34.239 startup coaching call. I'll also create
00:00:37.520 a new agent here called Hustle Coach.
00:00:41.040 And just for fun, in the instructions,
00:00:43.680 I'll tell it to be direct, hyperdriven,
00:00:46.559 and a bit over the top, like a founder
00:00:49.280 who just raised a seed round. Once the
00:00:52.559 agent's created, I can select it and I'm
00:00:55.520 ready to start the meeting. With
00:00:57.520 everything set, I click create meeting
00:01:00.239 and land on the new meeting
00:01:02.359 page. Right now, the meeting is
00:01:04.879 scheduled as upcoming, which means I can
00:01:08.080 come back to it later, cancel it, or
00:01:11.439 start the call whenever I'm ready. So,
00:01:14.320 I'll go ahead and hit start. That takes
00:01:17.200 me into a familiar looking lobby just
00:01:19.759 like Zoom or Google Meet where I can
00:01:22.400 check my camera and microphone before
00:01:24.600 joining. Once I enter the call, our new
00:01:27.759 agent, Hustle Coach, shows up right
00:01:30.600 after. This is a live AI in the meeting
00:01:34.159 with me responding in real time powered
00:01:37.200 by Stream Video SDK and Open AI Realtime
00:01:41.360 API.
00:01:42.880 Hey, hustle coach. What makes a good
00:01:45.759 startup idea? All right, listen up. A
00:01:49.439 killer startup idea boils down to three
00:01:52.320 things. Massive market potential, a
00:01:55.119 unique value proposition, and
00:01:57.399 scalability. You want a problem that's
00:01:59.680 begging for disruption and a solution
00:02:02.000 that screens innovation. And don't
00:02:04.640 forget, your model needs to scale like
00:02:07.600 wildfire. If you can pitch it in one
00:02:10.560 sentence and it sounds epic, you're on
00:02:13.200 to something hot. Now go out there and
00:02:15.920 disrupt, disrupt, disrupt. When the call
00:02:19.520 ends, the meeting switches to processing
00:02:22.440 status. Behind the scenes, background
00:02:25.120 jobs kick off automatically, powered by
00:02:28.000 ingest and agent kit. These workflows
00:02:31.360 handle everything. Fetching the
00:02:33.519 transcript, summarizing with AI, and
00:02:36.239 saving the results back to the database.
00:02:38.800 When the meeting is done processing,
00:02:41.040 it's marked as completed, and all the
00:02:43.599 content is ready. First, there's the
00:02:46.000 summary. A clean breakdown of what was
00:02:48.800 discussed, organized by topic, and
00:02:51.400 timestamp. Next is the transcript. It's
00:02:54.640 fully searchable and when you search for
00:02:56.800 a word, it highlights every place it
00:03:00.040 appears. The whole call is also recorded
00:03:03.280 and available to replay. And finally,
00:03:06.720 there's a chat GPT like interface that
00:03:09.599 actually understands the meeting powered
00:03:11.920 by stream chat SDK. You can ask for
00:03:15.560 specifics like who asked for advice and
00:03:19.040 it will give you the answer. Meet AI is
00:03:22.400 a SAS product. So, it runs on a
00:03:25.040 subscription
00:03:26.200 model. Down here, you can see I've hit
00:03:29.200 the limits of the free trial. When I try
00:03:32.400 to create a new meeting, I'm redirected
00:03:34.799 to a page with three upgrade options.
00:03:38.400 I'll go ahead and upgrade. And that
00:03:40.400 takes me through a quick checkout
00:03:42.319 powered by
00:03:46.280 Polar. Authentication is powered by
00:03:49.360 better out a fully free and open-source
00:03:52.720 out solution built for modern web apps.
00:03:56.480 It handles email login, social
00:03:58.879 providers, session management, and even
00:04:01.519 a seamless integration with Polar, our
00:04:04.400 payment
00:04:06.200 infrastructure. Our app is also fully
00:04:09.120 responsive. Every screen adapts cleanly
00:04:12.159 to mobile. Models and dropdowns turn
00:04:15.439 into mobile drawers for a smoother
00:04:17.839 experience on smaller
00:04:22.440 devices. In this course, we won't just
00:04:25.600 write the code. We'll also follow a
00:04:28.400 proper Git workflow throughout the
00:04:30.639 tutorial. Each chapter ends with a new
00:04:33.759 branch and a pull request reviewed
00:04:36.759 automatically using code rabbit AI.
00:04:40.400 Let's quickly go over the test stack.
00:04:42.560 We'll be using Nex.js 15 with React 19
00:04:46.479 together make our full stack framework
00:04:49.360 supporting server components and
00:04:51.440 serverside rendering. TRPC for full
00:04:54.800 stack type safety used together with
00:04:57.280 tanstack query. Drizzle OM with
00:05:00.479 Postgress provided by Neon for the
00:05:02.960 database. Tailwind version 4 for styling
00:05:06.240 combined with Chats UI for accessible
00:05:08.960 and reusable components. Better out for
00:05:11.880 authentication. Polar for payments.
00:05:14.720 Stream for video and chat SDK. Ingest
00:05:18.320 for background jobs. Code rabbit for AI
00:05:21.360 powered code reviews. And finally, Open
00:05:24.720 AI for real-time agents and AIdriven
00:05:28.440 features. And of course, we'll deploy
00:05:31.280 everything to production when it's
00:05:33.199 ready. And now, without further ado,
00:05:36.000 let's get started. In this chapter,
00:05:38.880 we're going to go ahead and set up our
00:05:40.880 project. This will include configuring
00:05:43.120 Nex.js, JS, confirming our environment,
00:05:46.240 installing Shhatzy UI, and finally
00:05:48.960 pushing our project to GitHub to
00:05:50.960 introduce some Git workflows. Let's
00:05:54.000 start with
00:05:55.400 Next.js. From their official
00:05:57.360 installation guide, we can find some
00:05:59.440 system
00:06:00.520 requirements. Let's go ahead and confirm
00:06:02.880 that we have the proper Noode.js
00:06:05.039 version. Purther instructions, it needs
00:06:07.440 to be at least
00:06:08.919 18.18 or higher than that. You can go
00:06:12.319 inside of your terminal and run
00:06:14.840 node-v. If you have a lower version or
00:06:17.759 you've gotten an error running this
00:06:19.600 command, you most likely have to
00:06:21.759 reinstall NodeJS. You can head to
00:06:25.240 nodejs.org and simply install the latest
00:06:27.919 long-term support version, which is in
00:06:30.479 my case
00:06:32.360 22.15.1, the exact same I'm using. After
00:06:36.000 that, you can restart your terminal and
00:06:37.919 run the command again to confirm. And
00:06:40.080 while you're there, it's a good idea to
00:06:42.319 also confirm these two commands, npm and
00:06:45.479 npx. These two commands come alongside
00:06:48.479 node. So you will automatically have
00:06:50.479 them installed, but it's always good to
00:06:52.720 double
00:06:53.880 check. Once you have confirmed those
00:06:56.880 three commands, you are ready to install
00:07:00.319 Next.js.
00:07:02.720 In their automatic installation chapter,
00:07:05.280 they instruct you to use the create next
00:07:07.800 app with the at latest
00:07:11.080 version. The latest version at the time
00:07:14.080 of me building this tutorial is
00:07:18.360 15.3.2. So instead of using at latest,
00:07:21.520 this is what I'm going to do. npx create
00:07:24.880 next app at 15.3.2.
00:07:29.120 The reason I'm doing this is so that you
00:07:31.759 the viewer is completely aware of the
00:07:34.479 version that I am using because I don't
00:07:37.680 know if you found this video 6 months
00:07:39.680 from now or a year from now. In that
00:07:42.400 case, the at latest will be
00:07:45.280 significantly different than the one I
00:07:47.440 am using. So my advice to you, if you
00:07:50.319 want to follow this tutorial exactly as
00:07:53.120 I am, use the exact same versions that
00:07:55.840 I'm using. So I'm going to be using
00:07:58.240 create next app at
00:08:01.400 15.3.2. Let's call our project meet AI.
00:08:05.039 And now we have to select some options.
00:08:07.280 You can use arrow keys to select between
00:08:09.360 yes or no. For TypeScript, select yes.
00:08:12.800 This is crucial. Slint is also yes.
00:08:16.479 Tailwind is also yes. Source directory
00:08:20.400 should also be yes. Make sure to change
00:08:22.560 it if no is default.
00:08:25.520 App router also yes. Turbo pack also
00:08:29.599 yes. And the only option I will leave at
00:08:32.399 no is to customize the import alias. I
00:08:35.519 don't want to customize it. I will leave
00:08:37.519 it the default. Let's wait for the
00:08:40.080 dependencies to
00:08:42.279 install. Once you get the success
00:08:44.800 message, you can go ahead and enter the
00:08:47.120 new directory. Change directory meet AI.
00:08:52.080 And inside you can enter ls command
00:08:55.120 which should list all the files and
00:08:57.120 folders
00:08:58.600 inside. Now that you've done
00:09:01.240 that before we run the project let's
00:09:04.160 quickly set up our IDE. In my case that
00:09:07.279 will be Visual Studio Code. So I'm going
00:09:10.160 to select open and I will select the
00:09:12.720 meet AAI repository. If you get a big
00:09:16.399 prompt asking if you want to trust the
00:09:18.320 authors you can select yes here.
00:09:21.360 Now let's quickly go inside of package
00:09:23.200 JSON and confirm the versions. React 19,
00:09:26.560 next
00:09:27.800 15.3.2, TypeScript 5, and Tailwind
00:09:31.920 version
00:09:32.839 4. Now let's quickly confirm our config
00:09:35.959 files. TS config, host CSS config, next
00:09:41.040 config, and slant config. There is no
00:09:44.399 Tailwind config because thanks to
00:09:46.720 Tailwind version 4, we have one less
00:09:50.240 config file which is absolutely
00:09:54.120 amazing. And also confirm that you have
00:09:56.640 the public folder. Confirm that you have
00:09:58.720 the source folder and inside the app
00:10:01.519 folder with favicon globals layout and
00:10:05.160 page. Once you have confirmed all of
00:10:07.600 that, you are ready to start the app
00:10:10.399 using npm rundev. And you can head to
00:10:13.680 localhost 3000 to see the
00:10:16.120 result. Depending on the light or dark
00:10:18.800 mode, you might see a white or black
00:10:21.880 background. Now, let's go ahead and
00:10:24.000 learn how to change something. Go inside
00:10:26.160 of the AMP folder,
00:10:28.120 page.tsx. And you can remove everything
00:10:30.320 from the return method. And you can
00:10:31.839 remove the image import. And instead,
00:10:34.640 just return a hello
00:10:37.240 world. And there we go. You should see
00:10:39.600 your change the moment you save your
00:10:41.600 file.
00:10:43.600 Now let's quickly try out Tailwind. So
00:10:46.800 I'm going to go ahead and write some
00:10:48.560 class names. Text for Excel font bold
00:10:52.720 and text green 500. And you have
00:10:55.839 probably immediately noticed that I have
00:10:58.320 some help writing this tailwind. I have
00:11:01.240 autocomplete. I have the color helper.
00:11:04.079 And when I hover over classes, I can see
00:11:06.800 the actual CSS. If you're interested in
00:11:10.079 having the same help, go ahead and
00:11:13.279 install the Tailwind CSS
00:11:17.000 IntelliSense, this package right here.
00:11:19.760 It is immensely helpful when writing
00:11:21.959 Tailwind. Go ahead and save this file
00:11:24.640 and immediately you should see your new
00:11:26.959 Tailwind changes.
00:11:29.399 Perfect. What we have to do next is we
00:11:32.240 have to install ChatsN UI. What is
00:11:35.680 Chatnen UI? So it is a set of
00:11:39.040 beautifully designed accessible
00:11:41.200 components and a code distribution
00:11:43.720 platform but it is not a component
00:11:46.480 library. Instead it is how you build
00:11:49.760 your component library. Let's go ahead
00:11:52.320 and add it to our project to understand
00:11:54.480 a bit better. I'm going to click
00:11:57.320 installation next.js and instead of
00:12:00.640 using at latest I'm first going to
00:12:02.720 confirm what is the actual latest
00:12:04.880 version. So you can use the same version
00:12:07.040 as I am. So I will just do d- version
00:12:11.240 here. And there we go.
00:12:14.680 2.5.0. So npx shaden at
00:12:18.839 2.5.0 in it. Make sure you're doing this
00:12:21.680 inside of your
00:12:23.639 project. Go ahead and select neutral for
00:12:26.720 the base color. and go ahead and select
00:12:30.360 d-leacy pure depths as the solution in
00:12:34.800 case some packages fail. Why would any
00:12:37.920 packages fail? Because we are using
00:12:40.240 React 19. React 19 is the latest React
00:12:43.600 version at the time of recording this
00:12:45.760 video, but not all packages have adapted
00:12:48.720 their peer dependencies to support React
00:12:51.600 19. And while they're still probably
00:12:54.720 working inside of React 19, installing
00:12:57.519 them throws warnings in some cases
00:13:00.399 errors which completely break the
00:13:02.160 installation cycle. So you have to
00:13:04.560 override them by using either d-force or
00:13:08.639 d- legacy peraps. In our case, we will
00:13:13.040 use d- legacy peer deps. So select the
00:13:16.639 arrow keys and choose d- legacy pure
00:13:20.720 deps and wait for the installation to
00:13:25.079 complete. Once the installation is
00:13:27.279 completed, you will be able to go back
00:13:29.120 to your project and you will notice some
00:13:31.519 new files here. If you're wondering
00:13:33.920 exactly which files are new, you can
00:13:36.000 click in on this little source control
00:13:38.639 icon and you will see everything that
00:13:41.360 has changed. So some of this was changed
00:13:44.320 by us. For example, this page which now
00:13:47.519 only displays hello world. So obviously
00:13:50.240 we are not interested in this. But we
00:13:52.639 are interested in the new utils file
00:13:55.440 which seems to have added a new function
00:13:58.240 called CN which is actually short for
00:14:00.880 class name or class names which we will
00:14:03.360 be using to safely merge, combine and
00:14:06.480 dynamically add tailor wind classes.
00:14:08.880 It's going to come in very very handy.
00:14:11.040 So that's one of the files that our chat
00:14:13.839 init command has added. Another thing it
00:14:16.880 has modified is our
00:14:19.959 globals.css. What it modified it with is
00:14:22.720 adding an actual theme for our project
00:14:25.920 and we will be able to modify this theme
00:14:28.720 and then our project will look unique
00:14:31.440 later on. And it also installed a couple
00:14:34.480 of packages like class variance
00:14:36.880 authority
00:14:38.279 clsx lucid react uh tailwind merge and I
00:14:43.839 believe one more tailwind animate css
00:14:46.959 everything else was already here but uh
00:14:49.760 it might have moved position like next
00:14:52.399 you can see the next version didn't
00:14:54.000 change it just moved the position so
00:14:56.480 don't worry the next version was not
00:14:58.399 modified and we also have the
00:15:00.240 components.json JSON which you can think
00:15:02.079 of as a config file for chat and UI and
00:15:05.600 I didn't mention but also or did I uh
00:15:08.240 lucid react these are our icons which we
00:15:11.120 will use for the project but we still
00:15:14.079 can't really see any components here and
00:15:16.480 they instruct us to add a button
00:15:18.480 component here. So while we can do that
00:15:21.920 two things that will annoy us throughout
00:15:24.000 this project is first of all remembering
00:15:26.639 what is our version and the second one
00:15:29.519 is remembering to choose d-leacy peer
00:15:33.279 depths every time. So instead how about
00:15:36.320 we add all components at once and then
00:15:39.440 later just get rid of those we don't
00:15:42.480 need. So we only have to remember the
00:15:44.959 chatsen version one more time and we
00:15:47.279 only have to select d- legacy peer deps
00:15:50.399 one more time as well. So I will select
00:15:54.600 this and I will select d- legacy peer
00:15:58.240 deps one last time and let's wait for
00:16:01.680 this to install all
00:16:04.440 dependencies. And there we go. All of
00:16:06.880 these components have now been added to
00:16:09.199 our project.
00:16:11.199 You can go inside of your source
00:16:12.639 components UI and you will see all of
00:16:14.800 them here. And that's the power of
00:16:17.120 shhatsen UI. They are not just added as
00:16:20.320 npm packages. Instead, they are actual
00:16:24.560 coded components inside of your project,
00:16:27.440 which gives you the power to customize
00:16:29.519 every single last bit of them. And
00:16:31.600 that's exactly what we will do in this
00:16:33.959 tutorial. So, let's go and try one
00:16:36.639 component out. Let's go inside of the
00:16:38.800 app folder page. Instead of returning a
00:16:41.600 div, let's return a button from
00:16:43.839 components UI
00:16:46.360 button. In case it's your first time
00:16:48.639 seeing the add sign, it's basically an
00:16:51.480 alias which makes it easier for us
00:16:54.079 instead of doing this all the time. So
00:16:57.759 basically the alias sign moves the
00:17:00.800 import to
00:17:02.360 source if that makes sense. you will see
00:17:05.359 uh it will make more sense later as we
00:17:07.359 work with the project. And now let's go
00:17:10.240 ahead and add click me
00:17:13.559 inside. Once you save this and go ahead
00:17:16.720 and mpm rundev your project
00:17:19.640 again, instead of the hello world, you
00:17:22.240 should now see a click me button. And if
00:17:25.599 you add a variant here like
00:17:27.960 destructive, it will change its color.
00:17:31.120 But the cool thing is if you click
00:17:33.039 command or control and click on the
00:17:35.600 button to enter it or of course manually
00:17:38.640 go inside of source components UI button
00:17:42.160 you will be able to add or change any
00:17:44.640 variant. For example, after link, make
00:17:47.600 sure you have a comma, and add custom
00:17:51.200 text white, background, purple 500,
00:17:55.799 border two, and let's do border red
00:18:00.679 500. Now, let's go back to the page. And
00:18:04.320 what you will notice now is that it has
00:18:06.559 automatically been added to the types
00:18:08.480 here. And there we go. We now have our
00:18:11.760 fun funky new variant. Of course, we
00:18:14.880 just used that for demonstration. You
00:18:16.880 can remove that now. And you can see how
00:18:18.559 you immediately get an error here.
00:18:21.280 Great. So, we now learned how to add
00:18:24.080 Chatsen components and how to use them.
00:18:26.640 And we've also learned the difference
00:18:28.480 between your usual component libraries
00:18:31.200 and Chatzen, which allows us to actually
00:18:33.919 see the code behind each component and
00:18:36.080 modify it to our liking.
00:18:38.799 One more thing we have to do is push
00:18:40.720 this project to
00:18:43.960 GitHub. So before we do that, we have to
00:18:46.880 commit all of our changes. And there's
00:18:49.600 quite a lot of them here. Since I'm
00:18:52.080 using Visual Studio Code, I will click
00:18:54.480 on the source graph here. And I will
00:18:57.200 simply use the plus icon to add or stage
00:19:00.880 all of these changes. This is equivalent
00:19:03.520 to get add dot command. Once all of
00:19:07.360 these have been changed have been staged
00:19:10.400 you will find them under the staged
00:19:13.120 changes
00:19:14.760 accordion and then you have to enter a
00:19:17.679 commit message. In my case I follow the
00:19:21.280 following convention. This is chapter01
00:19:24.840 setup. So I'm going to call this 01
00:19:28.320 setup as well. And I will simply click
00:19:31.039 commit. That's it. I'm not going to
00:19:33.120 touch anything else. We still haven't
00:19:36.240 pushed this to GitHub, but now we are
00:19:38.640 ready to do so. So go ahead and click
00:19:40.880 create new new repository and you will
00:19:43.039 see this screen. I'm to call this meet
00:19:46.240 AI and I will select it to private and I
00:19:49.840 will create a
00:19:52.440 repository. After that I'm going to go
00:19:54.799 ahead and select the second option which
00:19:57.440 is push an existing repository from the
00:20:00.240 command line. So just copy these three
00:20:02.880 lines here. go inside of your terminal.
00:20:05.200 You can shut down the app. You shouldn't
00:20:07.520 have any numbers here or anything
00:20:09.840 because uh nor should you have any
00:20:12.000 numbers here. Basically, it should all
00:20:14.160 be committed. And just paste those three
00:20:20.280 lines. And once you've done that,
00:20:23.360 refresh. And there we go. Your project
00:20:26.080 is now on GitHub. And you are ready to
00:20:28.400 follow the proper Git workflows. And you
00:20:31.039 can create pull requests, branches,
00:20:33.080 everything. Perfect. You can go ahead
00:20:35.520 and check inside of your source app
00:20:37.840 page. And inside of here, you should
00:20:39.840 have a button with click me. Perfect.
00:20:43.039 So, I think that wraps up our setup
00:20:45.120 chapter. We have set up Nex.js. We
00:20:47.600 confirmed our environment. We installed
00:20:50.080 Shatsen UI. And we pushed our project to
00:20:53.039 GitHub. Amazing job, and see you in the
00:20:55.520 next chapter.
00:20:58.559 In this chapter, we're going to go ahead
00:21:00.559 and set up a database and an OM for our
00:21:04.760 project. Let's get started and let's
00:21:07.200 obtain a Postgres database using Neon.
00:21:10.880 You can visit neon.te or you can use the
00:21:14.000 link in the description to let them know
00:21:16.080 you came from this video. Let's go ahead
00:21:19.280 to the Neon homepage and let's quickly
00:21:22.080 create or log in using
00:21:25.080 Google. After you are inside of your
00:21:27.600 dashboard, you will be able to create a
00:21:29.840 new project. I'm going to call this one
00:21:32.720 meet AI and I will set the database name
00:21:36.000 to meet AI as well. Once I create the
00:21:39.760 project, I can click on the connect
00:21:41.440 button and this will help me obtain my
00:21:44.640 database URL connection string.
00:21:48.720 Once you've obtained that, go inside of
00:21:50.799 your project and create a new
00:21:52.960 environment file in the root of your
00:21:55.480 application. Go ahead and create a
00:21:57.440 database URL. And inside of the quotes,
00:22:00.799 simply paste the copied snippet. It goes
00:22:04.000 without saying that you should never
00:22:05.440 share this with anyone. All environment
00:22:08.080 variables that I will be using are for
00:22:10.240 this tutorial and it will be removed
00:22:12.480 after this tutorial. You however should
00:22:15.200 not share this with anyone.
00:22:18.400 Make sure you didn't misspell database
00:22:20.559 URL here. And also do one more thing.
00:22:23.360 Confirm that your environment file is a
00:22:26.240 little grayed out. That means that it's
00:22:28.880 added to Git ignore and that you will
00:22:30.960 not be able to accidentally commit it.
00:22:34.280 Great. After you've added the database
00:22:36.880 URL, it is time for us to set up our
00:22:40.640 Drizzle OM. So, let's go to orm.driel.te
00:22:44.880 theme or use the link in the description
00:22:47.360 to let them know you came from this
00:22:49.960 video. So, let's go to Drizzle ORM here.
00:22:53.520 Let's click get started. New database
00:22:57.799 Neon. And now what we're going to do is
00:23:00.640 we're going to install some packages.
00:23:03.760 What I've prepared here is the versions,
00:23:06.880 right? So, what we're going to do is
00:23:08.720 we're going to prepare and without
00:23:10.320 pressing enter, we're just going to go
00:23:11.840 ahead and get the latest versions of
00:23:13.840 each one. Just in case you're watching
00:23:16.000 in the future, you will know what
00:23:18.799 versions I'm using.
00:23:21.600 So
00:23:23.159 drizzlem04 43.1 neon database serverless
00:23:27.120 is
00:23:32.919 1.1.1.1 and my environment is
00:23:43.240 16.5.0 and I will also add
00:23:48.679 d-leacy-per depths. So this is all in
00:23:51.600 one line and this will basically help me
00:23:54.159 avoid those errors which I was talking
00:23:56.880 about regarding peer dependencies.
00:23:59.760 Please use this line otherwise you will
00:24:02.559 get an error. If you get an error no
00:24:05.520 worries just try again and add- legacy
00:24:09.120 pure
00:24:11.320 depths. After you run this command you
00:24:13.760 should have three new packages. Let's go
00:24:16.400 inside of a package JSON. We can check
00:24:19.279 here as well. Neon database
00:24:22.440 serverless environment and drizzle ORM.
00:24:26.480 There we
00:24:27.960 go. So neon database serverless is
00:24:30.480 version
00:24:31.400 1.0 environment 16.5 and Drizzle OM
00:24:37.080 0.43.1.
00:24:39.080 Perfect. Now let's add Drizzle Kit and
00:24:43.000 TSX as our dev dependencies.
00:24:47.120 So the drizzle kit version I will be
00:24:49.200 using is
00:24:54.919 0.31.1 and the TSX version I will be
00:24:58.640 using is
00:25:02.520 4.19.4 and let's add legacy here deps
00:25:06.880 here as
00:25:08.440 well. This will add these two
00:25:11.720 packages right here in the dev
00:25:14.159 dependencies. We now have Drizzle Kit
00:25:16.880 and
00:25:18.600 TSX. Great. Now we can close all of
00:25:21.919 these. I mean, you didn't even have them
00:25:24.320 open, but I will close them. We've
00:25:27.120 already established step two, adding the
00:25:29.520 connection variable. So, we can go
00:25:31.120 immediately to step three. I'm going to
00:25:33.760 copy this snippet here, and I will go
00:25:35.600 inside of
00:25:36.679 source database folder and inside an
00:25:40.240 index DS. Let's paste this inside. And
00:25:44.080 I'm going to change this to double
00:25:45.679 quotes and I will add an exclamation
00:25:47.360 point here at the end. And I will do
00:25:49.919 export const
00:25:51.880 database. One thing I want you to double
00:25:54.320 check is go inside of your environment,
00:25:57.600 copy this key and paste it here because
00:26:01.440 you would be surprised how easy it is to
00:26:03.919 misspell this and no errors will be
00:26:06.640 thrown if you for example put an I here
00:26:09.120 instead of an L. It just won't work. So,
00:26:12.159 what I recommend is just copy it from
00:26:14.320 here and then paste it here. There we
00:26:16.840 go. And add an exclamation point to get
00:26:19.840 rid of the error. Great. Now, let's go
00:26:23.440 ahead uh and do the following thing. So,
00:26:26.559 in here, we we are okay with using neon
00:26:29.480 http. Uh if you need a synchronous
00:26:31.840 connection, you can use the neon
00:26:33.760 database serverless. We have it
00:26:35.520 installed. So, if you want to uh you can
00:26:38.000 do it like this as
00:26:39.559 well. Great. So now what I want to do is
00:26:43.440 I want to create a table and we can do
00:26:47.440 this exactly. So I'm just going to copy
00:26:49.919 whatever they did. Source databases
00:26:53.799 schema.ts. Let's go inside of
00:26:57.080 schema.ts. There we go. And this really
00:27:00.320 doesn't matter because we will remove it
00:27:02.440 later. But for now, yeah, let's use
00:27:04.880 integer pg table and vchart here.
00:27:08.799 uh and for the id it will be generated
00:27:11.440 always as identity here this will be
00:27:14.400 unique uh and these will be integers and
00:27:17.520 these will be vars with a fixed length
00:27:21.360 once you've done that we have to set up
00:27:23.279 a drizzle config file so we can copy
00:27:26.400 this as well and create drizzle
00:27:29.400 doconfigts in the root of our
00:27:36.679 application there we
00:27:39.200 I'm going to go ahead and just modify
00:27:40.880 these two double quotes. I love using
00:27:43.760 double quotes. There we go. And let's
00:27:46.480 just confirm that this is correct. So my
00:27:50.400 out will be uh slashdrizle. My schema is
00:27:56.000 at source database schemas. Let's double
00:27:59.039 check source database schemas. My
00:28:01.919 dialect is Postgress and my database
00:28:04.960 credentials are correct. And once again,
00:28:07.919 just double check database URL and just
00:28:10.720 add it here. Make sure you have the
00:28:13.360 Drizzle config outside of any folders
00:28:16.919 here. Great. And now what you have to do
00:28:19.520 is you have to apply the changes to the
00:28:21.880 database. The easiest way to do that is
00:28:24.720 by using npx drizzle kit push.
00:28:29.880 Alternatively, there are more advanced
00:28:32.320 methods such as generating the actual
00:28:34.960 migrations and then applying the
00:28:37.320 migrations. But since we are not working
00:28:40.080 in a team, we are working solo. This is
00:28:42.480 just a tutorial. We're going to keep it
00:28:44.640 simple and we will directly push our
00:28:46.720 changes to the database. So let's go
00:28:49.520 ahead and clear this and let's just do a
00:28:52.720 comparison. So if you go inside of your
00:28:54.240 neon now and go inside of your tables
00:28:56.720 here, you will see that for the meet AI,
00:28:59.760 there are zero tables in the public
00:29:01.600 schema. But if I do npx drizzle kit push
00:29:05.520 right here, you can see that it pulled
00:29:08.640 the schema from the database and it
00:29:10.880 applied the changes. So if I try
00:29:13.120 refreshing now, I have the users. The
00:29:16.799 user has an ID, name, age, and email.
00:29:21.360 There we go. Perfect. So, we've added
00:29:25.279 Drizzle OM, we've added the schema, we
00:29:28.559 pushed the schema, and we verified the
00:29:30.480 changes in Neon. But one thing that we
00:29:32.640 didn't do is verify changes in Drizzle
00:29:35.039 Studio. So, let's go ahead and do that.
00:29:39.559 Now, using a similar
00:29:42.600 command, npx
00:29:44.919 drizzle-kit, instead of push, you can
00:29:47.200 type
00:29:48.440 studio. And in here you can click on
00:29:52.440 local.drizle.studio. So you have two
00:29:54.000 options. You can either locally use the
00:29:56.080 drizzle studio like this or you can use
00:29:58.880 them in the neon
00:30:00.919 console. There we go. So these are in
00:30:04.000 sync. They are the same uh studio.
00:30:07.760 Amazing. Right. And now what I want to
00:30:10.880 do is create some scripts just to help
00:30:14.720 us in the future. So let's go inside of
00:30:16.399 package.json JSON here and let's go
00:30:19.360 ahead and add database push and let's
00:30:22.960 map that to
00:30:24.840 drizzle-kit push and database
00:30:30.039 studio will be
00:30:34.760 drizzle-kit studio. So
00:30:37.880 now instead of doing npx I don't have to
00:30:41.679 do that anymore because drizzle kit is a
00:30:44.320 part of our dev dependencies here. So
00:30:47.679 instead I can do npm run database studio
00:30:51.200 like this. It's going to be more
00:30:53.520 generic. So later on if for any reason
00:30:56.399 you replace your database you can keep
00:30:58.720 the uh command that you can keep the
00:31:02.080 familiarity with your command. Right?
00:31:04.320 And we are also not going to have to
00:31:06.799 remember this command anymore. npx drik
00:31:10.000 studio. We can just use our database
00:31:12.480 push then database studio like that.
00:31:16.720 Excellent. So I believe that is it. We
00:31:19.120 have verified the changes in the studio.
00:31:21.120 Now what we have to do is create, review
00:31:23.279 and merge this pull request.
00:31:26.720 Let's go inside of our source control
00:31:28.799 here and under the changes, let's click
00:31:31.919 the big plus button and this will mark
00:31:36.240 them as staged changes and this is zero
00:31:40.240 to database. I believe it is. So I will
00:31:44.080 press commit and since we have already
00:31:46.480 connected with GitHub this time uh what
00:31:49.440 we can do is we can check out to a new
00:31:52.480 branch and I'm going to call this 02
00:31:56.279 database. There we go. So I have
00:31:59.120 committed but I'm in a new database
00:32:01.360 because I didn't push yet. In case you
00:32:03.360 already pushed, no worries, okay? We are
00:32:05.440 just learning the git workflow here. You
00:32:07.519 can do the branch process in another
00:32:09.200 chapter. It's completely fine. No
00:32:10.960 worries. But uh if you didn't push, you
00:32:14.080 can create the new branch using the IDE
00:32:16.799 just like I did. And I will just click
00:32:18.880 publish branch. That's it. And now my
00:32:23.120 branch will be published. So I'm going
00:32:25.360 to go inside of GitHub repository and
00:32:27.519 see what
00:32:29.559 happens. Inside of my GitHub repository,
00:32:32.640 you can see that I have a new branch
00:32:34.320 with recent uh pushes here. So I will
00:32:36.880 click compare and pull request. But just
00:32:39.840 in case you don't have this, you can go
00:32:42.000 inside of pull requests manually, click
00:32:44.240 on new pull request, keep the main as
00:32:47.440 base, and select your new branch here
00:32:50.720 just in case you want to do it manually.
00:32:52.559 And then click create pull request. And
00:32:55.120 I'm going to now click create pull
00:32:59.480 request. Now in here, uh yours will
00:33:03.760 probably look like mine was a second
00:33:06.399 ago. you probably don't have Code
00:33:09.519 Rabbit. So, what is Code Rabbit? Code
00:33:12.320 Rabbit is an AI tool which will uh
00:33:15.440 almost act like a teammate for me and
00:33:18.240 it's going to review all of the changes
00:33:21.039 that I just added here and it's going to
00:33:24.240 give me a summary of what I just did and
00:33:27.919 also some comments, even some
00:33:31.000 potentially breaking issues. So, it's a
00:33:34.080 very useful teammate for us. And we're
00:33:36.880 going to see our code being reviewed by
00:33:39.120 AI for each chapter. So, we know we
00:33:42.640 didn't commit any bugs. And you'd be
00:33:45.640 surprised. In my last tutorial, Code
00:33:48.720 Rabbit caught so many bugs. I was
00:33:52.399 shocked. So, I'm excited to see what it
00:33:55.039 will catch. Now, I'm going to pause the
00:33:57.840 video and play it when it's
00:34:01.880 finished. And here we go, a summary by
00:34:05.200 code rabbit. We introduced some new
00:34:07.279 features. Integrated Drizzle OM and the
00:34:09.839 Neon database support. We added a what
00:34:12.879 is a temporary database schema for users
00:34:15.679 including fields for ID, name, age, and
00:34:18.960 unique email. We've also added some
00:34:21.359 environment variable management for
00:34:23.199 secure database connections. So, no
00:34:25.440 worries. It did not detect a new
00:34:27.520 environment variable. It detected that
00:34:30.480 we're using it for database connections.
00:34:32.639 So no, we did not commit any environment
00:34:36.000 variables here. And we also detected
00:34:38.560 some chores such as new scripts for
00:34:41.359 database migrations and studio access.
00:34:44.879 And we in here we have a more in-depth
00:34:47.280 walk through. Uh specifically we have
00:34:50.280 changes file by file exactly what we
00:34:54.320 modified and how. And we even have a
00:34:57.040 sequence diagram which will in become
00:35:00.079 increasingly useful as we add some
00:35:02.560 complex things. Right now the only
00:35:04.800 sequence it can create is our app
00:35:07.359 connection with the neon database
00:35:09.440 through Drizzle OM. But later on when we
00:35:12.400 add some hooks and components, it will
00:35:15.040 create equally if not even more useful
00:35:17.760 diagrams to help us understand that. And
00:35:21.520 in here we have some actionable
00:35:23.760 comments. As you can see here, it
00:35:26.160 recommends adding an environment
00:35:28.320 variable validation for database
00:35:30.920 URL. Basically, inside of our let me see
00:35:35.520 index here, we put an exclamation point
00:35:38.960 here because we just know that the
00:35:41.599 database URL will exist. But Code Rabbit
00:35:46.000 recommends doing an if clause and
00:35:48.240 throwing an error if it's not set. And
00:35:50.480 then we can use it without uh the
00:35:52.640 exclamation point. It also recommends
00:35:54.800 using the Neon database serverless
00:35:56.680 driver. So in our case, I'm fine the way
00:35:59.760 it is. Uh I'm always open to suggestions
00:36:02.960 like this one. But uh this is how I
00:36:05.680 initially built the project and I didn't
00:36:07.440 have any problems whatsoever. And I
00:36:09.920 think it's okay because with if we are
00:36:12.320 missing the database URL, nothing is
00:36:14.480 going to work either way. So we don't
00:36:16.000 have to put an explicit if clause for
00:36:18.160 that. And as per database uh neon
00:36:20.960 database serverless well using the
00:36:23.760 drizzle you know configuration here we
00:36:26.000 can see it's fine to use neon http
00:36:28.720 serverless is if we want a synchronous
00:36:30.880 connection more specifically if we want
00:36:32.640 to use websockets. Uh but it's
00:36:35.119 completely fine to use neon http for
00:36:37.760 this tutorial. Let's see what else it
00:36:39.920 gave advice for. So in here I think it's
00:36:43.119 the same thing. It's recommending an if
00:36:45.440 check for the database URL. Of course, a
00:36:48.160 good suggestion, but as I said, if this
00:36:50.640 is missing, everything will break
00:36:53.240 anyway. And here's an interesting thing.
00:36:55.680 So, it actually detected that some
00:36:57.920 issues were opened in Drizzle or Drizzle
00:37:00.640 Kit where they had a mismatch between
00:37:03.200 Drizzle Kit and Drizzle OM. So, our
00:37:06.079 Drizzle Kit version is 0.31
00:37:09.440 uh and our Drizzle RM is 0.43. So, it's
00:37:13.280 telling us to be careful here, but it's
00:37:16.000 completely fine. Uh, they don't have to
00:37:18.720 match exactly. Perhaps that was an issue
00:37:21.760 previously in some previous versions,
00:37:23.599 but it's completely fine. You can see
00:37:25.520 it's working with no problems
00:37:27.720 whatsoever. Great. So, I'm ready to
00:37:30.480 merge my pull request. We got a very
00:37:32.720 good review. Uh, and this is how we are
00:37:36.720 going to review our code every time.
00:37:39.920 Great. So once you have merged this, you
00:37:42.720 will see this says merged. And you can
00:37:44.960 now go back to your code and you can
00:37:47.440 change your branch uh back to
00:37:51.960 main like this. And you can press
00:37:56.599 this and click okay. And it should
00:37:59.960 synchronize your branch with main. And
00:38:03.520 when you look at your graph here, you
00:38:05.920 will see that we had our 01 setup commit
00:38:10.480 and then we branched out into a new
00:38:13.359 version uh I mean into a new branch and
00:38:17.119 then we merged that pull request back
00:38:20.320 here. So it's important that next to
00:38:23.440 your main branch here you don't see any
00:38:26.400 numbers. You can click this button as
00:38:27.920 much as you want. It will simply
00:38:29.880 recsynchronize. So, make sure you don't
00:38:32.160 have any weird numbers here or any
00:38:34.400 numbers here. Make sure your graph looks
00:38:36.880 like this. And that means that you are
00:38:39.440 ready to go onto the next chapter.
00:38:42.640 Amazing. So, if you want to have code
00:38:45.680 reviews like this, you can visit coder
00:38:48.359 rabbit.ai or use the link in the
00:38:50.720 description if you want to let them know
00:38:52.400 you came from this video. I highly,
00:38:55.040 highly recommend this, especially if
00:38:56.880 you're working solo and have no one to
00:38:58.880 review your code.
00:39:00.960 There we go. So, let's go ahead and wrap
00:39:03.119 this up and see you in the next
00:39:07.560 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
00:39:10.079 go ahead and create our authentication
00:39:13.320 setup. We're going to be doing that
00:39:15.440 using better AL. We're going to
00:39:18.240 configure the new ALF schema. We're
00:39:21.040 going to push those changes to Neon
00:39:22.960 database. And we will create a very
00:39:25.520 basic temporary UI which will allow us
00:39:28.400 to create a new user. And we will
00:39:31.040 finally create review and merge the pull
00:39:34.079 request for this chapter. Let's start by
00:39:37.119 adding better out. So you can head to
00:39:40.920 better-al.com or use the link in the
00:39:43.280 description to let them know you came
00:39:45.200 from this
00:39:46.280 video. So we're going to go ahead and
00:39:48.720 click get started right here. And if you
00:39:51.760 want to read more about Better Out, you
00:39:54.160 can read it here. It's an absolutely
00:39:57.200 amazing library. I I have not seen a
00:40:00.640 library as good as this in a while. So,
00:40:03.920 I'm going to go inside of the
00:40:05.200 installation tab here, and we're going
00:40:07.280 to do mpm install better out. And just
00:40:10.560 for this project's longevity sake, I
00:40:13.280 will use an exact version uh
00:40:18.599 1.2.8 like this. And let's see. Uh, I
00:40:22.000 forgot to add d-leacy peer depths. So,
00:40:25.119 of course, we get an error. So, let's
00:40:27.359 repeat this. But let's add d-leacy peer
00:40:31.680 depths. And let me confirm that this was
00:40:33.520 the correct version
00:40:35.400 1.2.8. It is. There we go. So, when I
00:40:37.839 add d- legacy per depths, we have no
00:40:40.960 error
00:40:42.280 whatsoever. Great. Now, let's go ahead
00:40:45.200 and let's add the better secret
00:40:47.760 environment variable here.
00:40:50.400 So I'm going to add this and you can add
00:40:53.520 whatever you want inside or you can use
00:40:55.599 the button generate secret here and just
00:40:58.319 copy whatever is here. It really doesn't
00:41:01.440 matter but it must not be empty. You
00:41:03.760 need to write something inside. For
00:41:05.680 production obviously it would be a good
00:41:08.000 idea that it's something the length of
00:41:10.319 this rather than just you know secret.
00:41:13.440 Uh but for development it doesn't
00:41:15.440 matter. Just make sure it's not empty.
00:41:19.359 Let's also set the better out URL
00:41:23.480 here and we can set it to be localhost
00:41:27.359 3000 under the HTTP
00:41:30.280 protocol. So it's important that you
00:41:32.480 know the protocol of your app and you
00:41:34.480 can find it every time you do npm
00:41:37.640 rundev. In here you can see my protocol
00:41:40.400 is http localhost 3000. So you can copy
00:41:43.680 this and add it here. It needs to
00:41:47.240 match. Great. And now let's go ahead and
00:41:50.240 let's create a better ALF instance. So
00:41:53.440 the place I'm going to do this is inside
00:41:56.800 of source and inside of lib I will
00:42:00.160 create ALF.
00:42:03.160 DS and I will simply import better from
00:42:07.040 better out. And I will export const
00:42:11.000 here. And let's quickly just visit my
00:42:13.920 package JSON just so you can doublech
00:42:16.800 check my versions
00:42:19.240 1.2.8. There we
00:42:21.640 go. Now let's go ahead and configure a
00:42:24.240 database. As you can see, it immediately
00:42:26.319 offers Postgress here, but we will
00:42:28.560 actually be using Drizzle. So it has an
00:42:31.839 option for that as well. Of course, it
00:42:34.319 does. So I'm going to add the Drizzle
00:42:37.280 adapter here from better al adapters.
00:42:41.480 Drizzle and I will import
00:42:44.760 database from at / database which is our
00:42:49.040 Drizzle instance. So this is the exact
00:42:51.359 location that my database is in database
00:42:56.040 index. Now that we have both of them we
00:42:58.880 can add the database option
00:43:01.960 here and we can select the provider to
00:43:04.880 be PG which stands for posgress. Of
00:43:07.599 course, since we are using Posgress,
00:43:09.599 this is the correct
00:43:11.480 option. Let's see what else we have to
00:43:13.839 do. Now, we have to create the database
00:43:17.079 tables. So, better out includes a CLI
00:43:20.000 tool to help manage schema required by
00:43:22.640 the library. So, you have two options to
00:43:25.520 create the actual schema for your
00:43:28.000 authentication.
00:43:29.599 If you want to, you can use npx better
00:43:31.839 al cli generate or you can manually
00:43:35.520 create it by going inside of the
00:43:37.599 database section here and you will see
00:43:40.720 every single database item that we have.
00:43:45.520 What we are going to do is we are going
00:43:47.520 to use the CLI
00:43:50.520 here. So we are just going to use the
00:43:53.119 generate one. We are not going to use
00:43:54.800 the migrate one because we will be
00:43:56.640 pushing directly to the database.
00:44:00.319 Now, for longevity sake, I'm also going
00:44:02.720 to show you the version at the time. It
00:44:05.280 looks like the version uh of better out
00:44:07.839 CLI needs to match the better out. I'm
00:44:11.200 not sure if this is a coincidence, but
00:44:13.280 it makes sense that these two match. So,
00:44:16.640 yes, the version I'm using is 1.2.8. And
00:44:19.680 we don't need d- legacy pure deps here
00:44:22.079 because we're not installing anything.
00:44:23.680 We're just generating. Uh so, let's
00:44:26.560 click generate and let's see what
00:44:27.839 happens. I have to install this package
00:44:29.880 first
00:44:31.960 1.2.8 and let's see what will happen
00:44:34.319 once this
00:44:37.160 completes. So it's asking me do you want
00:44:39.760 to generate the schema to do /all schema
00:44:42.960 ts. I'm going to select yes. I want it
00:44:45.760 to be in a separate file so it doesn't
00:44:47.599 accidentally overwrite whatever I have
00:44:49.839 in my schema. So I will press yes. And
00:44:52.640 there we go. Schema was generated
00:44:55.119 successfully.
00:44:57.040 So now what we're going to do is we're
00:44:59.520 going to go inside of the out schema
00:45:01.040 here. We can remove integer. We don't
00:45:02.960 need
00:45:04.119 it. And now uh what I want to do is I
00:45:07.680 want to copy things just one by one from
00:45:10.079 out schema to my source database schema.
00:45:14.480 So instead of this users, you know, we
00:45:17.359 will have an actual user here. So we can
00:45:19.359 remove this actually. Uh, and we can
00:45:24.359 also add this
00:45:26.920 here. There we go. Uh, and what I would
00:45:30.000 like to do is just fix the indentation
00:45:32.960 of these so it looks a little bit
00:45:36.920 better. There we
00:45:39.960 go. Like
00:45:41.960 that. After we defined our user, let's
00:45:45.839 add our session. So the reason I'm doing
00:45:47.760 it one by one is just so we are a little
00:45:50.079 bit more aware of what we are adding to
00:45:52.319 our
00:45:54.599 schema and I'm just formatting it a
00:45:57.520 little bit. So what do we have so far?
00:45:59.119 We have the user here and we have a
00:46:01.920 session and you can see that session has
00:46:03.680 a relation to the user and once the user
00:46:07.760 it's deleted the session will be deleted
00:46:10.400 as well thanks to the cascade method
00:46:12.480 here. We also know that uh the email has
00:46:15.680 to be unique for example. So that's why
00:46:17.599 we are going one by one just so we're a
00:46:20.000 tiny bit more aware of what's going on
00:46:22.680 here. Now let's copy the account one. So
00:46:25.359 the accounts will be used for social
00:46:27.359 login here. Uh let me go ahead and fix
00:46:30.960 the indentation on this one here. And
00:46:33.920 this one is pretty simple. So it has a
00:46:36.160 relation to user as well.
00:46:40.160 And let's add the verification which
00:46:43.119 looks like to be the last one here. And
00:46:46.720 verification is self-explanatory. If we
00:46:49.440 want to add verification, we have the
00:46:51.359 table for that as well. Uh there we go.
00:46:55.280 So one, two, three, four tables. It
00:47:00.400 looks like we've added here. So let me
00:47:03.359 just confirm here. One, two, three,
00:47:07.040 four. We did not miss any. So we can now
00:47:10.240 go ahead and remove the out- schema. We
00:47:13.119 no longer need that here because we have
00:47:15.680 added it to our schema right here. Uh
00:47:18.800 and it looks just fine. Let's see what
00:47:21.920 else do we have to do now. So the next
00:47:24.880 step here is to migrate. But we are not
00:47:27.599 doing migration. We don't have to do
00:47:29.839 that. We have our script for
00:47:31.839 synchronizing with the database. And
00:47:34.079 that's going to be database push. It's
00:47:36.400 much simpler uh this way. So it looks
00:47:40.240 like uh we can do that already. So let's
00:47:44.560 do it. Let's see if we will encounter
00:47:46.720 any errors or will this work uh by
00:47:50.560 itself. So I'm going to try and do npm
00:47:54.400 run database push. I think we might
00:47:57.200 actually encounter some uh errors here.
00:48:01.599 So actually no errors but we do have a
00:48:03.680 question. Is account table created or
00:48:06.359 renamed? So uh this is asking us a
00:48:10.240 question because we previously had uh
00:48:13.599 the users table which we deleted right.
00:48:17.440 So we have two options here. If you want
00:48:20.319 to you can just nuke the database from
00:48:23.359 neon and just create a new project with
00:48:25.520 the new database and have a clean slate.
00:48:28.440 Right? But what you can also do is just
00:48:31.200 answer to these questions. So I'm going
00:48:33.040 to try answering the questions. If it
00:48:34.800 seems to be okay, no problem. But if you
00:48:38.800 for whatever reason think you've messed
00:48:40.720 this up, you can always just create a
00:48:42.480 new database and just obtain uh a new
00:48:45.839 database URL. Paste the new database
00:48:48.640 URL, run the command again and you won't
00:48:51.200 have these questions. So the account
00:48:53.359 table is a new table. So using the arrow
00:48:55.920 keys, I will select the plus option and
00:48:57.920 press enter. Same for the session. The
00:49:00.400 only thing I will uh say is the users.
00:49:02.880 So the users have actually been renamed
00:49:05.040 here and the verification has been uh
00:49:08.760 added. Now in here uh is email verified
00:49:12.800 column created or renamed. Uh so this is
00:49:17.280 a create created column. Image is the
00:49:20.400 created column. Created at is created
00:49:23.119 updated at is created. Uh and looks like
00:49:26.000 at the end of all of that uh I got some
00:49:29.680 errors. So, I'm not exactly sure if this
00:49:32.079 worked correctly. So, that's why I
00:49:34.559 wanted to tell you you don't have to
00:49:36.160 worry even if you mess this up like I
00:49:38.160 did. What you can do very simply is go
00:49:40.800 inside of your settings here, just
00:49:43.200 delete the
00:49:44.760 project, right? So, you have to learn
00:49:46.960 how to work with your database here. Of
00:49:48.880 course, obviously, this is just for
00:49:50.480 early development phases. You would not
00:49:52.640 consider actually doing this in
00:49:54.640 production. You would have proper
00:49:55.920 migration status, right? But let's just
00:49:58.240 try again. Meet AI 2 for example and
00:50:01.520 let's click create and again let's click
00:50:04.319 connect and copy the snippet and in here
00:50:07.680 let's just paste this
00:50:09.559 here. So just make sure you have the new
00:50:11.920 database URL and you don't have to
00:50:13.440 change anything else. Let's do npm run
00:50:18.319 push now and let's see if we will have
00:50:20.880 any errors. No errors at all because
00:50:23.760 this is a completely clean database. And
00:50:25.920 if you go inside of your tables here now
00:50:27.920 in Meet AI 2, you have account, session,
00:50:31.119 user, and verification. Those four
00:50:33.200 tables which we just added. So even
00:50:35.839 though we could probably work our way
00:50:38.640 around this issue and resolve it, I just
00:50:41.680 want you to see how I actually do these
00:50:44.160 kinds of things. When I develop things,
00:50:45.680 I often get into these kinds of
00:50:47.119 conflicts. Since I'm in early
00:50:48.640 development phases, I can just nuke my
00:50:50.559 database and speed up the process.
00:50:52.319 Again, please only do this in early
00:50:54.480 development phases like this one where
00:50:56.960 we are just learning how all of this
00:50:59.000 works. Excellent. So, we have done the
00:51:03.040 following. We have configured the out
00:51:04.880 schema and we have pushed the changes.
00:51:07.359 Uh I'm not sure if we can mark this as
00:51:10.720 completely integrated. I'm going to
00:51:12.240 check this one last. Let's see what else
00:51:14.079 we have to do. So, we now have to add
00:51:16.720 some authentication methods. We are
00:51:18.800 going to add social providers later. The
00:51:21.119 first one we're going to do is the
00:51:22.480 normal email and password. So let's go
00:51:24.960 inside of the out here and let's add
00:51:28.160 email and password
00:51:30.680 enabled. True. And just like that we
00:51:33.520 have enabled normal email and password.
00:51:36.480 But besides that you have pass key,
00:51:38.559 username, magic link. You have so many
00:51:42.079 different ways of authenticating here.
00:51:45.359 And that's only uh what they provide you
00:51:48.000 with. There's also the community
00:51:49.440 plugins. So it's it's absolutely insane.
00:51:52.319 Now what we have to do is we have to go
00:51:54.079 inside of app folder API out. So let's
00:51:58.480 quickly go ahead and do that. Source app
00:52:01.520 folder let's create a new one called API
00:52:04.319 and inside inside of square brackets
00:52:07.440 out. So we are following instructions
00:52:09.680 exactly as they say which I've messed up
00:52:12.640 my apologies. out without square
00:52:14.880 brackets and then inside of square
00:52:18.680 brackets three dots all. So this is kind
00:52:22.079 of a catch all route and then finally
00:52:24.640 inside of that a reserved file name in
00:52:27.280 nex.js route.ts which represents an API.
00:52:31.599 So we can then copy this and paste it
00:52:33.520 inside. So we are registering our AL
00:52:37.359 client here to post and get route for
00:52:41.280 our localhost 3000/ API/ and then
00:52:45.280 whatever comes after it. This is like a
00:52:48.000 catch all universal
00:52:49.880 route. Excellent. So now that we have
00:52:52.720 that, we also have to create the client
00:52:55.960 instance. Uh so let's go inside of our
00:52:59.359 lib here.
00:53:02.000 The same way we created ALF, we will now
00:53:04.319 do
00:53:06.680 ALF-client.ts like this. And we can just
00:53:09.839 copy this entire thing here and paste
00:53:12.760 it. So the base URL of the server, you
00:53:16.000 can see it says optional if you're using
00:53:18.000 the same domain. So you actually don't
00:53:20.240 need this at
00:53:21.960 all because we are on the same domain.
00:53:26.640 And finally, you now have uh uh you can
00:53:30.960 now Yeah, my apologies. No, I thought
00:53:32.880 that this was an example, but um they
00:53:35.440 are showing you that you can also export
00:53:37.599 individual methods and hooks from create
00:53:40.640 out client instead of exporting the
00:53:43.599 entire AL client, but I'm fine with this
00:53:46.559 way. And there we go. So that's it. You
00:53:49.280 are now ready to use better AL in your
00:53:51.680 application. continue to basic usage to
00:53:54.400 learn how to use the ALF instance uh to
00:53:58.000 sign in users. So let's go inside of the
00:54:00.960 basic usage here. And what we're going
00:54:04.000 to do is inside of
00:54:06.760 page.tsx
00:54:08.760 here, we will just create a very simple
00:54:12.319 uh form here. So I'm going to mark this
00:54:16.880 as use client so I can make it reactive
00:54:19.760 and add some hooks here. And I'm going
00:54:22.960 to add email set email use
00:54:27.640 date. And then I will do the same thing
00:54:30.079 for name. Set name and
00:54:33.640 password. Set password. Obviously uh
00:54:37.280 this is not how we will build forms. But
00:54:39.440 what we we are doing now is just a very
00:54:41.599 very basic confirmation that our uh
00:54:44.800 better out has been integrated properly.
00:54:47.440 So what I'm going to do here is just a
00:54:50.880 div and then I'm going to add an input
00:54:53.920 from components UI input which we have
00:54:56.160 because we added all components from
00:54:57.920 chats UI. I'm going to give this a
00:55:00.920 placeholder of name. This one will be
00:55:04.559 email. This one will be password with a
00:55:07.119 type of
00:55:08.200 password. And I will just go ahead and
00:55:11.040 give this one a value of name. and on
00:55:14.920 change
00:55:16.839 event target
00:55:19.440 uh
00:55:20.359 value. And I will just copy these and
00:55:23.520 add them down here. There we go. Uh
00:55:29.040 oops, I completely forgot to actually
00:55:30.960 wrap this. Uh so this will be set name.
00:55:36.800 This will
00:55:38.119 be set
00:55:42.520 email. This will be set
00:55:48.520 password. The value
00:55:50.839 here will be email and the value here
00:55:54.640 will be
00:55:56.440 password. I will just collapse this so
00:55:59.599 you can see better.
00:56:02.640 Okay, I just collapsed these elements so
00:56:05.680 you can see them
00:56:06.920 better. And let's go ahead and try it
00:56:10.079 out. All we need is a button here which
00:56:12.640 will say create
00:56:20.359 user. So I'm going to do npm rundev and
00:56:24.160 I will visit my localhost 3000 which
00:56:27.119 should now show my very simple form.
00:56:29.760 Here we can give this a class name
00:56:32.640 padding four flex flex column and gap y
00:56:35.760 of four just so they have a little bit
00:56:38.480 more space here. And what I will focus
00:56:41.440 on here is my network tab. I want to see
00:56:44.799 what's going on here as well. So what we
00:56:48.640 want to do now is we want to learn how
00:56:51.119 to use better out here. So let's import
00:56:54.799 out client in here.
00:57:01.760 And let's use the out client in our
00:57:05.680 onsubmit method
00:57:07.720 here. So what I'm going to do is call
00:57:10.799 out
00:57:11.640 client dot sign in and let's see if is
00:57:15.839 that the correct one? My apologies. It
00:57:17.680 is sign
00:57:19.559 up
00:57:21.079 email. And inside of here I have to pass
00:57:24.240 in the email. I have to pass in the
00:57:26.559 name. and I have to pass in the
00:57:28.640 password. So these are the three
00:57:30.319 required ones. You can also pass the
00:57:32.240 image if you want to and the callback
00:57:34.280 URL. And let's also add these right
00:57:40.119 here. So on
00:57:43.319 error, let's do window
00:57:46.040 alert. Something went
00:57:49.240 wrong on success.
00:57:54.079 window
00:57:55.000 alert success just so we are aware of
00:57:58.880 what's going
00:58:00.520 on. Great. So now that we have this
00:58:04.960 um let's go ahead and try submitting. So
00:58:09.720 const on click on
00:58:14.599 submit. So I think by default we should
00:58:17.359 get an error here just by clicking this.
00:58:19.760 Let me try. There we go. something went
00:58:22.799 wrong. Obviously, we get an error
00:58:24.960 because we have an invalid email because
00:58:26.799 the email was not passed at all. So, I'm
00:58:29.599 going to set my name to be Antonio, my
00:58:31.920 email to be Antonio at uh
00:58:35.079 demo.com. And let's use the password to
00:58:37.920 be
00:58:39.000 password. One hint, your password needs
00:58:41.839 to be I think at least eight characters,
00:58:45.040 otherwise it will throw an error. So, if
00:58:46.720 I just do one to three and click create
00:58:48.480 user again, we have an error here.
00:58:51.040 password is too short. So try 1 2 3 4 5
00:58:54.640 6 7 8 and let's see again something went
00:58:58.799 wrong. Let's see what exactly it
00:59:02.119 is. There we go. So uh this one wasn't
00:59:06.000 exactly clear from the return here from
00:59:08.960 the network tab. But if you go inside of
00:59:11.359 your terminal, you will see some errors.
00:59:14.000 Server error, weather out error, drizzle
00:59:16.559 adapter, the model user was not found in
00:59:19.599 the schema object. Please pass the
00:59:21.839 schema directly to the adapter options.
00:59:25.280 So this is what I was waiting for
00:59:27.280 because I knew that my AL configuration
00:59:31.119 looked a little bit different. So I was
00:59:32.880 waiting for the reason why. And it looks
00:59:35.599 like because we need to add our entire
00:59:38.240 schema. So let's import asterisk as
00:59:41.040 schema here from at database schema and
00:59:46.559 let's go ahead and pass the schema here
00:59:51.040 and simply spread the
00:59:53.880 schema like that. So we have now
00:59:56.880 connected our schema user session all of
01:00:01.200 these things with the schema here. And I
01:00:03.680 think that if you kind of like try and
01:00:06.000 rename something here, you might
01:00:08.799 actually get an error here or not. Maybe
01:00:11.680 not. But let's try again now. So I'm
01:00:15.119 going to try Antonio. Antonio demo.com.
01:00:18.319 And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Create
01:00:23.000 user. Looking promising. And there we
01:00:25.920 go.
01:00:27.559 Success. 200. And we can now go inside
01:00:32.400 of our neon console here. Refresh this
01:00:35.920 and go inside of user. And there we go.
01:00:38.240 You can see the actual user. So Antonio
01:00:41.559 demo.com. You can see when we are
01:00:43.839 created. You can see the matching
01:00:45.440 account with the credential provider ID
01:00:48.000 because we didn't use the social login.
01:00:49.839 We used credentials. And you can also
01:00:51.839 see the active session because we are
01:00:54.200 automatically logged in actually. And
01:00:57.040 the verification doesn't exist because
01:00:58.720 we didn't add anything regarding
01:01:01.640 verification. But yes, this is the part
01:01:04.240 that was missing adding our schema here.
01:01:07.680 Uh and one more thing I want to check
01:01:09.599 here is is there a nice way to maybe
01:01:12.240 display that we are logged in. Uh let's
01:01:14.559 say uh can I
01:01:18.280 check let's actually try and follow the
01:01:22.000 documentation here. So this is sign in.
01:01:24.079 Okay, that works just fine. social sign
01:01:27.200 on. How do I actually see the session?
01:01:31.040 That's what I'm using. There we go. The
01:01:34.680 session. So, I'm just going to go ahead
01:01:37.920 and add this here from
01:01:40.119 outclient use
01:01:42.280 session. All that I care about is the
01:01:45.040 data which remaps to session here.
01:01:50.799 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:01:52.880 check if I have a session. We are going
01:01:56.559 to return a div here with a class name
01:02:00.240 flex flex column padding four and gap
01:02:04.760 y of four and I will add a paragraph
01:02:08.559 logged in
01:02:10.680 as session do user
01:02:14.280 name like this and let's add a button
01:02:18.000 here sign out on click and I think we
01:02:22.319 can just do
01:02:23.480 outclient sign out
01:02:27.000 here like
01:02:29.160 this. There we go. You can see that in
01:02:31.839 initially it shows the the register.
01:02:34.720 That's because this is an actual fetch
01:02:36.640 request. So it's loading for some time.
01:02:38.559 You can of course extract is pending
01:02:40.640 here if you want to handle that. But
01:02:42.720 this is just for demo. And when I click
01:02:44.799 sign out, uh there we go. And the cool
01:02:47.920 thing now is that if I try registering
01:02:52.680 again, I will get thrown an error
01:02:55.920 because this email is already taken.
01:02:59.680 User already exists. Perfect. So the
01:03:02.960 only thing that's missing here is a way
01:03:05.359 to uh log in. So let's quickly add this
01:03:09.440 as well just for fun. Let's do it. Let's
01:03:13.119 do a class name here. Flex flex call.
01:03:16.000 Yep. Y10 and we can just copy this
01:03:19.039 entire thing and paste it below and this
01:03:21.520 will be login. This just needs the name
01:03:26.240 and onsubmit will be on login here and
01:03:29.359 let's just copy onsubmit
01:03:33.079 here. Let's call it on
01:03:35.480 login outclient sign
01:03:40.839 in. Looks like we can also use email
01:03:44.079 just like that. There we go. So let's
01:03:46.160 try this. Let's try
01:03:49.480 antoniodemo.com. And yes, both of them
01:03:51.599 will be filled, but that's completely
01:03:53.200 fine. Let's try the wrong password
01:03:55.680 first.
01:03:57.400 Password. Click
01:04:00.760 login. Something went wrong and I didn't
01:04:04.559 open my network tab. But I'm pretty
01:04:06.400 confident that we got, as you can see
01:04:08.480 from the code
01:04:10.119 401. Let's try again.
01:04:13.599 invalid email or password. Now let's try
01:04:16.720 actual password here. Actually 1 2 3 4 5
01:04:19.680 6 7 8. Let's try logging
01:04:22.200 in. And success. There we go. Logged in
01:04:26.319 as Antonio. Just like that, we have
01:04:29.599 implemented credential out. And it only
01:04:32.240 gets easier from here. This was the
01:04:34.160 hardest part of our authentication.
01:04:36.319 Absolutely amazing amazing library. Uh,
01:04:40.079 and of course we only tested this in the
01:04:43.119 client mode because it's just, you know,
01:04:44.799 easier to create a form here and add all
01:04:47.200 of these callbacks and things, but you
01:04:49.680 can have equally uh good developer
01:04:53.359 experience with server components and
01:04:55.760 their server util and we will use that
01:04:58.640 later on. But as I said for this
01:05:01.039 chapter, I just wanted to build like a
01:05:03.599 very dirty basic UI to ensure that we
01:05:06.960 can actually create the new user. And
01:05:08.720 now let's go ahead create review and
01:05:10.559 merge this pull request. So I'm going to
01:05:13.200 go inside of my graph here. My apologies
01:05:16.319 my source uh source control here. Uh and
01:05:20.400 I'm going to go ahead and add all
01:05:22.280 changes and I before you commit you can
01:05:25.119 open the branch whenever you want. So
01:05:26.640 you can for example add the changes make
01:05:28.480 sure they are in staged go ahead and
01:05:31.119 click uh checkout to and then create a
01:05:36.319 new branch. So, I'm going to call this
01:05:39.280 uh 03
01:05:42.039 authentication
01:05:43.880 setup. I think that's the branch name.
01:05:46.319 Yeah, authentication setup. And the
01:05:49.119 message will be the
01:05:51.079 same. You can see your branch is down
01:05:53.760 here. You can click commit here and you
01:05:55.599 can publish your branch. As simple as
01:05:58.559 that. So, your branch is now available
01:06:01.359 for
01:06:03.000 review. Let's go ahead and click compare
01:06:05.599 and pull request.
01:06:07.839 And let's create a pull request. And in
01:06:10.480 a couple of seconds we will see the
01:06:12.640 review by code
01:06:16.280 rabbit. And here we have the summary. So
01:06:19.920 new features. We have introduced a
01:06:22.319 complete authentication system with user
01:06:24.880 sign up, login and sign out
01:06:27.039 capabilities. We have added a user
01:06:29.280 interface for authentication including
01:06:31.359 forms for registration and login as well
01:06:34.000 as conditional rendering based on the
01:06:35.839 authentication status, a new API
01:06:38.559 endpoint to handle authentication
01:06:40.559 requests and we have expanded the
01:06:42.960 database schema and of course the new
01:06:46.000 authentication library dependency. In
01:06:49.359 here, we have a more in-depth
01:06:52.000 walkthrough as well as file by file
01:06:54.720 change and a sequence diagram explaining
01:06:57.920 how our current form actually works. So
01:07:01.760 you can see here that when we fill up
01:07:03.920 the sign up or sign in form, we call the
01:07:06.640 sign up or login method which actually
01:07:09.839 reaches the API
01:07:11.720 al route which then handles the AL
01:07:15.359 request and then using the uh to the
01:07:18.079 database it validates or stores the user
01:07:21.200 session and account entities and then it
01:07:25.680 equally returns that state back to the
01:07:28.160 user and the UI. Of course, it left a
01:07:31.520 ton of comments in regards to our form
01:07:34.559 because that is just a temporary form
01:07:36.720 which is missing a ton of things. So,
01:07:39.240 naturally, all of these recommendations
01:07:41.760 are correct. But no point in resolving
01:07:44.079 them because we will be deleting that
01:07:45.920 entire component uh in place of a proper
01:07:48.960 one here. But if you're interested, you
01:07:51.200 can pause and read just to see how this
01:07:53.839 AI bot actually works because it is
01:07:56.160 quite impressive as well as the
01:07:57.599 suggestions it gives you. Uh, excellent.
01:08:00.960 And it actually refactors like your
01:08:03.119 entire component, but we will be doing
01:08:05.119 that later. So, no need to accept this.
01:08:07.839 Uh, in here, it adds some suggestions
01:08:11.520 for our schema. And regardless if this
01:08:14.640 is uh more correct or not, I don't want
01:08:17.439 to change anything because I want this
01:08:20.080 to be strictly compatible with better
01:08:22.319 out. I don't want to, you know, uh,
01:08:25.080 accidentally mess it up. Uh great. Uh so
01:08:30.080 in in here it marked a potential issue.
01:08:32.479 Sensitive credentials stored as plain
01:08:34.719 text. I think that is a confusion
01:08:36.960 because this is called text. That
01:08:39.679 doesn't mean that what's stored inside
01:08:41.520 is not encrypted, right? It is just a
01:08:45.600 text type. This is true. It could be a
01:08:49.198 varcher with a uh token limit. But I
01:08:52.560 think they do exactly that. They encrypt
01:08:55.679 it, but they just store it under a text
01:08:58.880 type from
01:09:00.679 Drizzle. All of these other suggestions
01:09:03.040 are semantic or new syntax here. So, I'm
01:09:06.799 going to go ahead and merge this pull
01:09:08.960 request because I am satisfied with this
01:09:11.759 result. Excellent. Once you have merged
01:09:14.238 this, go back to your IDE here and
01:09:19.359 switch to your main branch. So you just
01:09:23.120 have to find the origin
01:09:25.560 main and then just go ahead and click
01:09:28.399 this and fetch origin here and that
01:09:31.279 should recsynchronize everything here.
01:09:33.839 When you go to your graph, there we go.
01:09:36.158 You can see that uh we have added the
01:09:38.640 database in the previous one and in this
01:09:40.399 one we added the authentication setup
01:09:43.439 and everything regarding authentication.
01:09:46.080 Let me just close package lock so you
01:09:48.399 can see the actual uh code like our
01:09:50.640 session and our form and we just merge
01:09:52.880 that into main. You can of course go
01:09:55.520 inside your app page to confirm that you
01:09:57.840 can see the code in here. Excellent. So
01:10:01.840 that's it. We just merged our code. You
01:10:04.880 can always try this multiple times in
01:10:08.000 case you think it's not synchronized for
01:10:09.679 whatever reason. And that's it. Let's go
01:10:13.360 ahead and mark this as completed.
01:10:15.760 Amazing job and see you in the next
01:10:19.080 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
01:10:21.760 develop the UI for our authentication.
01:10:24.719 This will include the AL pages, out
01:10:27.520 layout, out module, and finally the AL
01:10:30.560 views or
01:10:32.600 components. Let's go ahead and let's do
01:10:35.360 one thing first. So right now if you
01:10:39.199 take a look at our package JSON in here
01:10:41.520 you can see the d-turbo packac option
01:10:44.640 and when you run your app you will see
01:10:47.679 the turbo pack here and you will see
01:10:49.600 turbo pack right here. What I want you
01:10:52.480 to do is to remove turbo pack. That is
01:10:55.920 because I found an issue with the
01:10:58.960 layouts which is something that we will
01:11:00.960 be learning in this chapter. And that
01:11:03.600 issue simply makes it a bit harder to
01:11:05.360 demonstrate uh what I want to teach you
01:11:07.920 in this chapter. So for now go ahead and
01:11:10.480 remove that and save package JSON. And
01:11:13.199 then go ahead and do npm rundev again.
01:11:16.400 If you you will know that you've done it
01:11:18.480 correctly when you no longer see turbo
01:11:20.400 pack as opposed seeing it right here. So
01:11:23.280 just go ahead and do that. That is the
01:11:25.679 first thing we have to do. The next
01:11:27.840 thing we are going to do is create our
01:11:29.920 first route. So let's go inside of
01:11:31.600 source app folder and let's do sign dash
01:11:35.280 in and inside a page dsx file. Let's go
01:11:40.640 ahead and do an export default and let's
01:11:43.520 simply return sign in
01:11:45.960 page. Two things you have to know here.
01:11:49.199 Page is a reserved file name. If you've
01:11:52.560 named it something other than page,
01:11:55.040 Nex.js will not recognize this as a
01:11:58.159 route. The second important thing is to
01:12:01.520 always do a default export in that
01:12:04.159 reserved page file name. Otherwise,
01:12:07.360 Nex.js will not be able to find the
01:12:10.159 component it needs for
01:12:12.600 routing. Now, if you want to find this,
01:12:16.080 what you have to do is simply go to
01:12:19.520 localhost
01:12:22.920 3000/sign. So, let's go ahead and visit
01:12:25.440 that page right here. So you can see I
01:12:28.560 still have my old form here. But if I go
01:12:31.840 to localhost
01:12:34.199 3000/sign-in, we can find the sign in
01:12:37.320 page. So now let's go ahead and copy and
01:12:39.920 paste this and let's rename this one to
01:12:42.239 sign up. Let's go inside of the page and
01:12:44.880 change this to sign up page. This one is
01:12:47.840 visible at the same one, just dash sign
01:12:52.360 up. There we go.
01:12:54.960 Now let's say that I want to add some
01:12:57.120 design here. For example, for this
01:12:59.840 signin page, I will add a class name
01:13:02.400 background muted flex minimum height of
01:13:07.400 svh flex column items center justify
01:13:12.800 center padding of six medium padding of
01:13:16.560 10.
01:13:18.560 And then I'm going to add an inner div
01:13:21.520 here which will be used to limit the
01:13:25.000 width. Width will be full by default but
01:13:28.400 on mobile devices the maximum it will be
01:13:31.280 able to expand to is 24 rem or 384
01:13:35.719 pixels. On larger devices we are going
01:13:38.560 to increase this to 3 XL or 768 pixels.
01:13:47.280 Now let's go ahead and check this out.
01:13:50.400 So sign up page is all the way here. But
01:13:52.719 if I go into sign in, you can see how it
01:13:55.040 is uh pushed down here. And this is
01:13:58.080 actually centered and it will be easier
01:14:01.040 for you to understand that if you for
01:14:03.120 example wrap it with a card component,
01:14:06.239 you have the card component available
01:14:08.560 since we have added all components from
01:14:10.640 shatzen UI. So it is right here in
01:14:13.679 source components UI card and that's
01:14:16.159 where you can import it from. So now it
01:14:19.120 makes more sense. This is definitely a
01:14:21.040 centered
01:14:22.280 component. What I want you to do now is
01:14:24.880 go inside of sign up page here and
01:14:27.360 simply add the same
01:14:29.640 card without anything else. So just the
01:14:33.400 card. So now you can see a clear
01:14:35.679 difference between sign in and sign up
01:14:37.840 pages. They are they have different
01:14:39.840 backgrounds and they have different
01:14:42.520 positions. But since we know that we
01:14:44.960 want the exact same style for both of
01:14:47.440 these routes, there should be a way to
01:14:49.440 reuse this layout. And there is. Let's
01:14:52.800 learn that by creating a new folder
01:14:54.640 called AL. Let's go ahead and select
01:14:57.040 both sign in and sign up and let's drag
01:14:59.199 and drop them inside. If you are asked
01:15:01.600 to update the imports, you can select
01:15:03.520 yes.
01:15:05.960 Now first thing you will notice is that
01:15:08.400 our page has turned into a 404. That's
01:15:11.520 because it is no longer available at /s
01:15:14.080 sign in. Now it needs out sign in.
01:15:17.520 That's how you create nested
01:15:20.040 routes. There we go. And same thing is
01:15:23.199 true for sign
01:15:24.600 up. But what we've unlocked now is a
01:15:27.760 parent folder. Parent folder can now
01:15:30.800 have a layout file. Layout is a reserved
01:15:34.719 file name just like page and it behaves
01:15:38.000 pretty similar. It needs to have a
01:15:40.159 default export. The name of the
01:15:42.000 component does not matter. But what does
01:15:45.760 matter is that you always return the
01:15:47.920 children from here. Children are a type
01:15:50.400 of React
01:15:51.880 node. Let's go ahead and destructure
01:15:54.320 them from
01:15:55.880 here and let's render them inside of
01:15:58.480 this empty div.
01:16:01.120 So right now not much will change. Sign
01:16:04.480 up still looks like this and sign in
01:16:06.800 still looks like this. But what I want
01:16:09.920 to do is I want to go inside of sign in
01:16:11.840 here. And I want to copy these two divs.
01:16:16.320 And I will instead put it here in the
01:16:18.800 layout. And I will add an additional
01:16:21.120 closing div here. And I will indent the
01:16:23.600 children. And now I'm going to go inside
01:16:26.080 of the sign-in page and I will remove
01:16:28.080 everything besides the card here. So my
01:16:31.520 signin page and my sign up page now look
01:16:34.480 identical besides the text inside of
01:16:37.560 them. And in my layout I have now added
01:16:40.880 the class names. And what happens now?
01:16:43.760 The signin looks exactly the same and
01:16:46.000 the signup also looks the same. signup
01:16:50.159 has now gotten those styles that it
01:16:53.040 didn't previously have. So that's the
01:16:55.280 power of layout files. Layout files are
01:16:58.440 reusable well layouts that you can use
01:17:01.600 and this will apply to every route that
01:17:04.719 I create inside of the out folder.
01:17:07.679 That's why we needed a parent folder.
01:17:10.560 But you are probably wondering what if
01:17:13.360 you just want to have an organizational
01:17:15.520 folder, right? Because while this is
01:17:18.000 cool, it also extended our URL, right?
01:17:21.360 We now have to visit using /out here.
01:17:24.159 What if I want to go back to this? Do I
01:17:26.640 have to write the layout file
01:17:29.040 individually in each page as I did
01:17:31.000 before? No, you don't. What you can do
01:17:33.679 is use something called route groups. Go
01:17:36.560 ahead and rename this into AL in
01:17:39.400 parenthesis. If it asks you to import to
01:17:42.239 update the imports, you can select yes.
01:17:45.120 What this will do is it will mark this
01:17:47.840 as an out uh as a route group which
01:17:51.360 means that your routes are now
01:17:52.880 officially accessible back through its
01:17:55.280 original URL. You can see that the
01:17:57.520 current one is 404. But if I go back to
01:17:59.760 my old ones, there we go. Now I have a
01:18:02.560 much cleaner URL, but I also preserved
01:18:05.679 the ability to create a unique layout
01:18:08.960 file for that group of routes. So this
01:18:13.600 basically tells the Nex.js router do not
01:18:16.640 include this in the URL. That doesn't
01:18:19.600 mean don't include this folder in
01:18:22.159 routing. It simply means this specific
01:18:25.120 folder it's just a grouping folder.
01:18:28.560 Right? This will not be a part of the
01:18:30.480 URL. This will be a part of the URL. And
01:18:33.440 you can nest this kinds of things as
01:18:36.159 deep as you want. They won't stop
01:18:38.159 working. Right? Whenever you have
01:18:40.239 something in parentheses inside of the
01:18:41.920 app folder, it will be excluded from the
01:18:46.600 URL. But that does not mean excluded
01:18:49.760 from routing. That's important to
01:18:52.600 understand. Great. So now that we have
01:18:55.040 this set up and we have learned about
01:18:56.800 the layout and how we can use it, how
01:18:58.960 about we go and create the actual
01:19:01.600 module. So let's go inside of the
01:19:03.520 source. Make sure you are in the source
01:19:05.360 and create modules. And inside of here,
01:19:08.320 create the ALF module. And in here, I'm
01:19:11.760 going to keep everything ALF related.
01:19:14.239 Let's start with our UI. In here, we're
01:19:18.159 going to have views. So, modules out UI
01:19:21.679 views. Go ahead and create signin
01:19:25.800 view.tsx just like this. This is a
01:19:28.640 component, so it does not need to have a
01:19:30.640 default export. We can just do sign in
01:19:36.840 view and return sign in
01:19:40.760 view like this. Or let's be a bit more
01:19:44.440 specific uh let's return a card from
01:19:47.600 components UI card. And now if you go
01:19:50.719 inside of your sign in
01:19:54.120 page. So right here in the out route
01:19:57.199 group you can just return that sign in
01:20:01.480 view. So now our page here is used
01:20:04.800 purely for routing and it just renders
01:20:08.600 this and we are going to develop the
01:20:11.040 actual code inside of the module where
01:20:12.960 it belongs. So now sign in looks
01:20:16.360 identical.
01:20:18.000 So let's go ahead and do the same thing.
01:20:20.560 Sign in view. Let's copy it. Sign up
01:20:24.920 view. Let's rename this to sign up view.
01:20:28.719 And change this to sign up view. And
01:20:30.960 just to clarify, this is a my code
01:20:34.000 structure. This is not something you
01:20:35.520 have to do. Modules is not a reserved
01:20:37.679 folder in Nex.js. This is simply how I
01:20:40.640 like to separate my modules. Right?
01:20:43.520 Instead of writing the actual code in
01:20:45.280 pages, I mostly use page for redirects
01:20:48.800 for prefetching uh and then I just
01:20:51.280 render the actual component I need maybe
01:20:53.199 for some suspense or something like
01:20:55.040 that. But I keep them as server
01:20:57.679 components so that I can leverage
01:20:59.760 everything server components has to
01:21:01.360 offer and then I simply do the client
01:21:03.040 stuff inside of these views right
01:21:05.880 here. So now let's go ahead and go
01:21:08.719 inside of sign up here and let's do the
01:21:11.199 same thing here. So sign in view, my
01:21:13.520 apologies, sign up
01:21:15.239 view, remove the unused imports and you
01:21:18.080 can remove these comments. We now know
01:21:20.320 how to access these routes, right? And
01:21:23.120 uh now before we move on, I just want to
01:21:25.679 go quickly back inside of these views
01:21:27.840 and into both of them, go ahead and add
01:21:30.880 use client at the top. So signup view
01:21:33.600 and signin view, both of them should
01:21:36.000 have use client at the top. And what I
01:21:38.640 want you to do is add a console log sign
01:21:41.760 up
01:21:43.480 view and go inside of sign in and add
01:21:46.960 sign in
01:21:49.880 view and then go inside of these pages
01:21:54.040 here. So sign in page add a console log
01:21:58.120 here sign in
01:22:01.960 page and sign
01:22:05.320 up sign up page. So all of these four
01:22:09.840 should have both the views and the
01:22:12.320 pages. The only difference is that
01:22:14.400 signup views have these use client
01:22:17.159 thingies. I'm purposely doing this to
01:22:20.480 show you something. So you can see that
01:22:22.480 when I'm on my signin view, the signin
01:22:25.840 page console logs from
01:22:28.920 page.tsx, but it has a server prefix.
01:22:32.800 This means that it's actually logging
01:22:35.360 this on the server and not on the page,
01:22:39.040 right? So I just wanted to show you that
01:22:41.520 difference. And if you go inside of the
01:22:42.960 sign
01:22:44.360 up, you will see the same thing. You can
01:22:46.880 see we have signup page on the server
01:22:49.520 whereas signin view is the actual client
01:22:52.360 component. So you can now remove these
01:22:54.560 console logs and uh I'm going to talk
01:22:57.040 more about server and client components
01:22:59.120 moving on but I think this is this will
01:23:01.520 gives you like the most basic uh
01:23:03.440 difference between the two. So our views
01:23:06.320 need to have use client because we're
01:23:08.719 going to do client stuff in them. So
01:23:11.199 let's start with the signin view. What
01:23:13.920 I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap
01:23:15.360 this inside of a div. Whoops. Let's just
01:23:17.679 move that here. I'm going to wrap the
01:23:20.239 card inside of a div. And I'm going to
01:23:22.080 give the class name flex flex column and
01:23:25.760 gap of six. Now for the card, I'm going
01:23:29.440 to give it a class name overflow hidden
01:23:31.679 and padding of zero. Then I'm going to
01:23:34.080 import card
01:23:36.120 content from the same at /components UI
01:23:40.400 card like this.
01:23:43.120 In the card content, let's give it a
01:23:45.040 class name here, grid padding of zero.
01:23:48.960 And on desktop, grid columns 2. So right
01:23:53.520 now, if you add a paragraph, for
01:23:55.760 example, column one, and then another
01:23:57.760 one, column two, and head into sign
01:24:03.000 in, you will see that these columns are
01:24:06.320 next to each other. But when you zoom
01:24:08.080 in, they collapse because that's exactly
01:24:10.960 what we told them to do. Only on
01:24:12.920 desktop, this has to become two columns
01:24:15.600 next to each other. Otherwise, it's
01:24:17.360 going to be beneath one another. That's
01:24:19.280 exactly how we want them to behave.
01:24:21.920 Great. So now what I'm going to do is
01:24:25.120 I'm going to uh create a form element
01:24:31.480 here like this. And in here I will
01:24:36.080 create a div
01:24:37.480 element simply so we can begin
01:24:40.080 separating these two. Now let's go ahead
01:24:43.679 and do the following. Let's do the
01:24:45.199 second column uh first because it's
01:24:47.760 easier. So this column right here. We're
01:24:50.480 going to do a class name here.
01:24:52.800 background
01:24:54.040 radial from and then in here uh let's go
01:24:59.040 ahead and say green 500 to green
01:25:06.040 800. Something like this. We can
01:25:08.639 experiment a bit. Let's try 700 to 800.
01:25:12.800 Or maybe make this a bit
01:25:15.960 darker. Something like this for now.
01:25:18.320 It's okay. Uh let's keep it relative.
01:25:24.040 hidden MD
01:25:26.920 flex flex column gap Y of four items
01:25:33.520 center and
01:25:35.000 justify center. So now you should see
01:25:37.840 column two here in the center like that.
01:25:41.040 And now what we're going to do is we're
01:25:43.760 going to render a paragraph here with a
01:25:46.960 class name text to Excel font semibold
01:25:51.679 and text white. And this will have meet
01:25:55.760 AI text inside or whatever you are going
01:25:58.639 to call your app. And then above this we
01:26:03.040 should have a normal image element. So
01:26:05.199 yes, it should have this warning. That's
01:26:06.880 okay. We should go to /lo.svg.
01:26:10.159 SVG and give it an alt here of image and
01:26:13.840 give it a class name here of height 92
01:26:17.280 pixels and the width of 92
01:26:20.280 pixels. Now you will get this because we
01:26:23.760 don't have a logo yet and I'm going to
01:26:27.280 show you where you can get one. So I
01:26:30.080 find my placeholder logos on logo Ipsum.
01:26:33.600 I think it's an amazing website with a
01:26:35.600 bunch of placeholder logos. All right.
01:26:38.320 So, you should only use this for your
01:26:40.400 demo applications. And the one I found
01:26:43.520 is this one. So,
01:26:47.000 logoipsum.com. You can of course find
01:26:48.880 the link in the description. All you can
01:26:51.440 do is just click on this logos and that
01:26:53.520 will copy the SVG. You can of course use
01:26:55.440 the normal download or you can just
01:26:57.840 click copy and then go inside of public
01:27:03.280 logo SVG and paste it inside. Let me
01:27:06.880 just
01:27:09.080 uh yes, if it asks you to open that uh
01:27:13.360 just click yes to open the editor and
01:27:15.520 then paste it inside. And then this will
01:27:18.880 uh have the logo. And when you refresh,
01:27:21.440 there we go. We have the logo. Now,
01:27:23.280 let's go ahead and just change the
01:27:24.719 colors a little bit here. So, we have
01:27:28.719 this color E22935.
01:27:32.000 Go ahead and use the find and replace
01:27:34.159 option here and change it to the
01:27:36.800 following color 6 a34 A and click uh
01:27:42.080 this one to replace all instances.
01:27:44.639 There's two of them. There we go. So
01:27:48.560 already when you refresh you will see a
01:27:50.639 change of color but now we have four
01:27:53.520 more instances of the red color. So use
01:27:56.400 the find method again. You can use
01:27:58.320 control F or command F if you haven't
01:28:00.480 been able to find it and replace this
01:28:03.199 one with
01:28:06.040 6cc58D. And you can use this one to
01:28:08.320 replace all four instances. And refresh.
01:28:11.520 And there we go. Perfect. So that is it
01:28:15.600 for this column right here. And now we
01:28:17.840 can focus on actually developing uh the
01:28:21.280 form. So what I'm going to do is I'm
01:28:25.120 going to go back in my sign in view
01:28:27.880 here. And since we installed all
01:28:31.679 components from chaten, we also got some
01:28:34.880 new packages. Uh and one of them is zod.
01:28:39.360 So we can import z from zod. And you can
01:28:42.719 go inside of package json and search for
01:28:44.880 zod to confirm that you have it.
01:28:47.760 Besides
01:28:48.920 this, we are also going to need uh zod
01:28:54.040 resolver from at hook form resolvers
01:29:00.600 /zod. And we are also going to need the
01:29:04.159 input component from components UI
01:29:07.639 input. We are also going to need the
01:29:10.719 button from components UI button. And
01:29:15.520 we're also going to need all the
01:29:18.600 components from components UI form. So
01:29:23.600 let's add this as well. You have all of
01:29:25.280 this installed, right? All of this
01:29:27.120 already exists in your project. Uh don't
01:29:30.800 confuse this ad sign with this ad sign.
01:29:33.520 So this is the name of the npm package
01:29:35.520 and this is the name of our alias.
01:29:37.920 That's where I add space between imports
01:29:40.000 to separate my npm imports versus my
01:29:43.360 local imports.
01:29:46.560 Besides this, let's also import the
01:29:49.920 alert component. So, alert and alert
01:29:52.560 title from components UI
01:29:54.840 alert. And uh let's also
01:29:59.320 prepare octagon alert icon from Lucid
01:30:03.040 React. I think that's enough for us to
01:30:04.719 start with the development of the form.
01:30:07.360 So, let's define the form schema here to
01:30:09.520 be Z.Object
01:30:11.400 object
01:30:12.920 email a type of string and email and
01:30:17.800 password also a type of string and the
01:30:21.520 only thing I'm going to pass here is the
01:30:23.360 minimum length with the message password
01:30:26.639 is
01:30:27.480 required I will not change this to be
01:30:30.880 any other length because this is the
01:30:33.120 sign in view so it really does not
01:30:36.320 matter what length I put here right uh
01:30:40.080 the length matters for the registration
01:30:42.560 but I don't think you should ever
01:30:44.000 enforce the length on the sign in view
01:30:47.600 because uh what if you change your
01:30:50.800 requirement later on and you have a
01:30:52.560 bunch of users who no longer meet the
01:30:54.760 requirement you will prevent them from
01:30:57.040 logging in. So it only makes sense to
01:31:00.400 enforce that on
01:31:02.120 registration. So now that we have the
01:31:04.159 form schema, let's go ahead and let's
01:31:07.440 get use form. My apologies const form
01:31:11.679 from use form. And we did not import
01:31:14.800 this, but we should from
01:31:17.400 react-hook-form. This is another package
01:31:19.360 that we have installed. React hook form.
01:31:22.560 You can find it here. You can find hook
01:31:25.199 form resolvers. You can find lucid
01:31:27.920 react. All of those are installed when
01:31:30.800 we added all components from SHA CN
01:31:33.480 UI. Great. So now that we have this
01:31:35.920 inside of this, let's define Z infer and
01:31:39.040 let's add type of form schema. Inside of
01:31:43.040 this, let's add a resolver to be Zod
01:31:45.440 resolver and pass in the form schema.
01:31:47.679 And let's finally add the default
01:31:49.719 values. This should be an email and a
01:31:53.159 password just like this.
01:31:57.120 Now, let's go ahead and let's go back
01:31:59.679 inside of our card content here. And I'm
01:32:02.719 going to uh separate these with a space
01:32:06.400 just so I can find them more easily. And
01:32:08.639 let's actually add
01:32:10.280 our form with a capital F to wrap our
01:32:14.400 native form element. So this form with a
01:32:17.280 capital F is the import from
01:32:19.800 Shadnui and it
01:32:22.199 needs the entire form props. So this is
01:32:25.679 like a provider for all the form hooks
01:32:28.639 and components which we are going to use
01:32:30.960 going forward. Let's give this form a
01:32:34.000 class name of padding six and on large
01:32:38.320 devices padding
01:32:40.120 8. Then let's finally remove this text
01:32:43.280 and inside let's open a div and another
01:32:45.920 div inside. With the first outer div
01:32:49.120 give it a flex flex column and gap six.
01:32:52.800 And in the inner div, give it a flex
01:32:55.199 flex column again, items center and text
01:33:00.199 center. Inside of this inner div, you're
01:33:03.120 going to render an H1 element and below
01:33:05.520 it, you're going to render a paragraph
01:33:07.280 element. The H1 element will render out
01:33:10.960 welcome back with a class name of text
01:33:14.400 to Excel and font bold. And let's
01:33:17.280 quickly see how that looks like. There
01:33:19.040 we go.
01:33:20.400 And in the paragraph here, add a class
01:33:23.440 name text muted foreground and text
01:33:28.040 balance. And in here, you're going to
01:33:30.600 render log into your
01:33:35.000 account. Now, let's go ahead and outside
01:33:37.840 of this inner div, but still inside of
01:33:40.639 this outer div, you're going to render a
01:33:44.000 div with a class name grid and gap 3.
01:33:49.440 And inside you are going to render the
01:33:51.760 form field which is a self-closing tag.
01:33:55.120 Pass the control prop which is form
01:33:58.520 control name which is
01:34:01.800 email
01:34:03.320 render which will destructure our field
01:34:07.280 and go ahead and then inside render form
01:34:11.800 item. Inside of form item, add a form
01:34:15.360 label and write in your label for this
01:34:18.960 field which is email. Then add a form
01:34:22.639 control and finally inside the component
01:34:25.440 you want to use which in our case is a
01:34:27.760 normal input component. Type is email
01:34:32.440 placeholder can be
01:34:37.800 m@example.com and go ahead and spread
01:34:40.960 field. So now this input becomes a
01:34:43.280 controlled component. So that's how we
01:34:45.520 are going to build our forms modularly
01:34:48.719 and you can also add a self-closing form
01:34:51.719 message which will be used to render
01:34:55.040 errors if there are
01:34:57.480 any. Excellent. So now you have your
01:35:00.320 email uh right here. Perfect. And now
01:35:04.320 what you can do is you can copy this div
01:35:06.719 including the form field, paste it below
01:35:10.239 and change the name of this to be
01:35:12.080 password. And if you haven't noticed
01:35:14.080 already, this is uh strictly typed. So I
01:35:17.360 can only choose between email and
01:35:19.040 password because it reads from our
01:35:21.920 default values here. It reads from our
01:35:24.320 form schema.
01:35:26.880 So now in here where we added the name
01:35:29.199 password, change the form label to be
01:35:31.280 password and change the type to be
01:35:33.800 password. And for the placeholder, well,
01:35:36.320 you can just add some asterisks here. 1
01:35:38.400 2 3 4 5 6 7
01:35:41.480 8. There we
01:35:43.480 go. So now uh let's go ahead below this
01:35:48.639 and outside of this div we are going to
01:35:51.760 do the following. Let's do true. So
01:35:54.719 literally hardcode the word true and
01:35:58.080 render the alert component and inside
01:36:00.960 render the octagon alert icon and close
01:36:04.159 it. And then add an alert title and
01:36:07.360 render
01:36:08.760 error. In the alert give the class name
01:36:11.600 of background destructive divided by 10
01:36:15.120 which basically means 10%
01:36:17.639 opacity. Then uh let's go ahead and add
01:36:21.639 border-none. And for the octagon alert
01:36:24.320 icon, give it a class name height four
01:36:26.639 width four and add an exclamation point
01:36:30.239 text
01:36:33.239 destructive. This marks as dash
01:36:35.920 important uh I mean exclamation point
01:36:38.239 important. So now you have an error
01:36:40.560 here. So this is where we are going to
01:36:42.719 display our server errors because we
01:36:46.000 don't know what field exactly caused an
01:36:48.239 error but maybe our connection went out.
01:36:51.040 Maybe the database is down. This is
01:36:52.960 where we're going to display server
01:36:55.360 errors. That's why I have hardcoded it
01:36:57.280 to true. Later, this will be an actual
01:36:59.600 uh boolean value. Below this, add a
01:37:02.679 button and sign in text. Go ahead and
01:37:06.960 give it a type of submit and a class
01:37:10.159 name with
01:37:12.280 pool like this. There we go.
01:37:16.480 And now uh let's go ahead and do the
01:37:20.159 following here. Below this button, add a
01:37:23.600 div with a class
01:37:26.440 name. After border dash
01:37:30.760 border a relative text center text small
01:37:36.960 after absolute after inset zero after
01:37:42.960 top 1 and a half after zindex of zero
01:37:49.040 after flex after items center and after
01:37:54.159 border top.
01:37:56.880 Add a span element here or continue with
01:38:01.760 and give this a class name background
01:38:04.560 color of card text muted foreground
01:38:10.600 relative zindex of 10 and px of
01:38:15.080 two. So now you have this cool looking
01:38:18.560 line crossing text. And in here we're
01:38:21.440 going to add the buttons to log in with
01:38:24.080 socials. So outside of this
01:38:27.159 div, go ahead and add another div which
01:38:30.159 will serve as our grid specifically
01:38:33.520 handling two columns here. If you have
01:38:36.320 three social login, you would change
01:38:38.080 this to three. Right in here, add a
01:38:42.520 button. Go ahead and give it a variant
01:38:45.119 of outline, a type of button, and a
01:38:49.360 class
01:38:50.440 name with pool. type button is quite
01:38:54.080 important otherwise this button would
01:38:56.400 submit the
01:38:57.639 form and inside of here uh what we are
01:39:01.360 going to do is render the Google icon.
01:39:04.239 So for now let's just add the text
01:39:07.480 Google and in here
01:39:10.520 GitHub. So now you have Google and
01:39:13.199 GitHub texts right here. Great.
01:39:17.119 Uh, and then what I want to do is go
01:39:21.280 outside of this div right after we close
01:39:24.480 this button and add one more div here
01:39:26.719 with a class name text center and text
01:39:30.199 small. And in here you're going to add
01:39:34.040 don't have an account. And you can use
01:39:38.000 you can't exactly put an apostrophe
01:39:40.679 here. You have to use at signappos like
01:39:44.800 this.
01:39:46.480 So don't have an account import
01:39:50.679 link from next
01:39:55.480 slashlink. And in here you're simply
01:39:57.760 going to
01:39:59.639 redirect to slash sign up if you don't
01:40:03.440 have it. And inside just sign
01:40:06.360 up. Uh you can also do if it's easier
01:40:09.440 for your eyes you can add an empty space
01:40:11.920 like this and then collapse this. There
01:40:14.480 we go.
01:40:15.920 and give this link a class name
01:40:18.800 underline and underline offset
01:40:21.800 4. There we go. Don't have an account.
01:40:24.960 Sign up like this. Great. So now uh what
01:40:30.719 I want to do is just one more thing here
01:40:34.159 outside of this card here. Add a div
01:40:37.840 with a class name text muted foreground
01:40:42.440 asterisk column square brackets href
01:40:47.040 element column hover column text
01:40:51.159 primary text center text extra small
01:40:55.119 text
01:40:57.239 balance again this type of
01:41:00.679 sign but this time for underline and
01:41:04.159 then just copy it and add underline
01:41:07.320 offset four. And inside of here, you can
01:41:11.119 add a text by clicking continue. You
01:41:15.040 agree to
01:41:16.520 our and you would probably use an href
01:41:19.679 or link here for terms of
01:41:24.840 service
01:41:26.679 and privacy
01:41:29.800 policy and give this also an href. So
01:41:33.600 just some template for you to have.
01:41:35.520 There we go.
01:41:38.040 Perfect. So now let's go ahead and
01:41:41.040 actually make this form work. So in
01:41:44.480 order to do that, we have to create uh
01:41:48.440 the we have to add our ALF utils. So
01:41:52.480 let's go ahead and import the ALF
01:41:56.760 client, which we can do here. There we
01:41:59.840 go. out client from lib out client like
01:42:03.000 that and let's do the following. Let's
01:42:06.080 add con router here. Use
01:42:09.719 router. You can import that from next
01:42:15.400 navigation like
01:42:18.360 that. And then let's also add error set
01:42:23.199 error to be use state from
01:42:26.199 react by default. Set it to null. and
01:42:30.000 give it a type of string or null. You
01:42:32.880 can import use state of course from
01:42:37.880 react. And now let's create our const
01:42:41.679 onsubmit
01:42:43.000 method which is an asynchronous method
01:42:45.840 which accepts data which will be z.info
01:42:49.920 type of form schema. So we know exactly
01:42:52.480 what kind of data we are getting here.
01:42:55.119 First of all we are going to reset our
01:42:58.159 error here. And then we're going to
01:43:00.800 extract the error by using await
01:43:03.639 outclient
01:43:05.560 signin
01:43:08.600 email. And in the first argument for
01:43:12.159 this option, we will pass the email to
01:43:14.400 be
01:43:15.560 data. And password to be
01:43:19.880 data.pass. And in the second argument,
01:43:22.560 we are going to pass in the on success
01:43:25.880 here, which will be router.push.
01:43:29.719 push to the front
01:43:35.080 page and then in here if we have an
01:43:38.080 error actually we can do this
01:43:41.080 better we don't need this to be
01:43:43.360 asynchronous at all we can just I think
01:43:45.760 do
01:43:47.639 this and then in here on
01:43:51.800 error set error error which we have to
01:43:55.760 get from is
01:43:59.400 error and let's see dot
01:44:04.639 error
01:44:06.199 dot message like this or yeah I think
01:44:10.239 this will always be available maybe we
01:44:11.840 can destructure this
01:44:14.199 yeah and then like
01:44:20.040 this I think this should
01:44:24.360 work and now what we I have to do is go
01:44:26.800 inside of this form here. It's a native
01:44:28.719 HTML element and add on submit here to
01:44:31.119 be form handle submit
01:44:34.840 onsubmit. Let's see any errors. We do
01:44:37.440 have an error here. Unused variable. So
01:44:39.760 let's go and find our alert button.
01:44:42.639 Instead of true, it will be if we have
01:44:44.960 an error. And you can add double
01:44:47.199 exclamation points here. Make sure
01:44:49.199 there's double. So this turns it into a
01:44:51.600 boolean. And in here, just render the
01:44:53.760 error.
01:44:56.480 So let's go ahead and try it out. So
01:44:58.719 just by clicking sign in, you should
01:45:00.639 have the normal forward validation
01:45:02.400 errors. But if I try using something
01:45:04.080 that doesn't
01:45:05.320 exist. So I'm pretty sure I don't have
01:45:07.840 this
01:45:08.679 user and click sign in, I should be
01:45:12.239 getting an error back. There we go.
01:45:14.560 Invalid email or password. So this came
01:45:17.040 from the server, right?
01:45:21.600 If I if I try this
01:45:25.560 again, you can see that this error
01:45:28.000 message is coming from the server and we
01:45:30.560 are rendering it here. So the user knows
01:45:33.199 something went wrong. We can improve
01:45:35.360 this a little bit by also adding uh the
01:45:40.000 let's see what we can do disabled if we
01:45:42.880 are submitting but I'm trying to find a
01:45:45.280 good way of doing this. So we could of
01:45:48.560 course you know just add a new field set
01:45:51.199 is loading.
01:45:54.080 Maybe I should do that because yes, we
01:45:57.040 can also use the form state is
01:45:59.360 submitting. But since we will be using
01:46:01.960 um social login buttons, I think it's
01:46:05.040 more reliable for us to actually
01:46:06.880 introduce loading and actually this will
01:46:10.000 be
01:46:10.920 pending set pending use
01:46:14.280 state false by
01:46:16.920 default. So set pending here false as
01:46:20.560 well. And let's go ahead. Actually, this
01:46:24.080 will be set pending to true. And then in
01:46:26.639 here, we're going to add on. Let's see.
01:46:28.480 Do we have on
01:46:31.400 uh we can just do it after this, I
01:46:34.480 suppose.
01:46:36.040 Then set
01:46:38.199 pending
01:46:39.960 false. Maybe this isn't No, this will
01:46:42.880 not work like
01:46:45.960 that. We can just do this. It's
01:46:49.480 easier. and
01:46:51.400 then find the button and if it's pending
01:46:54.560 disable it. So now you have a nicer
01:47:00.040 experience. You can see the button is
01:47:02.080 disabled until it either returns with an
01:47:06.239 error or success. So you can copy this
01:47:09.760 and also add it to these buttons right
01:47:15.639 here. There we go. Perfect. So, this
01:47:19.440 form should now work. Now, let's go
01:47:21.920 ahead and copy it. So, we can copy
01:47:25.280 everything in here and go inside of
01:47:27.280 signup view and paste everything in
01:47:29.960 here. I'm first going to rename this
01:47:32.880 back to sign up view and go inside of my
01:47:36.320 sign up page to ensure no errors are
01:47:39.520 being thrown. And when I control or
01:47:41.440 commandclick here, I will be redirected
01:47:44.239 to this newly copied component. Make
01:47:46.960 sure you are working in the new copied
01:47:48.880 component so you don't override
01:47:50.239 anything. And let's start by introducing
01:47:54.480 uh the new form schema. So besides the
01:47:58.560 password
01:47:59.639 here, we are also uh I'm also just going
01:48:03.520 to say password is required. I won't
01:48:05.280 introduce any validation here because we
01:48:07.280 have backend validation from better out.
01:48:09.679 But what I will do is ensure that user
01:48:12.080 has to
01:48:13.320 confirm
01:48:15.080 password and I will also add a name
01:48:18.880 which will be Z string and min one
01:48:23.000 message name is
01:48:25.320 required. The reason we don't need that
01:48:27.760 for email is because this takes care of
01:48:30.840 that. But the confirm password uh will
01:48:34.560 be a little bit different. So this can
01:48:37.440 stay the same. And we're then going to
01:48:40.159 add
01:48:42.119 dotrefine get the data and check if
01:48:45.199 data.p password matches data confirm
01:48:50.199 password. But if it doesn't, the message
01:48:52.960 we're going to pass is
01:48:55.000 passwords don't whoops passwords don't
01:48:59.880 match. And the path well this basically
01:49:03.480 means what field should show this error
01:49:07.119 that should be the confirm
01:49:10.119 password like this. There we go. So now
01:49:13.920 inside of here everything can stay the
01:49:15.679 same but we now also have
01:49:18.119 name and we have confirm
01:49:21.480 password. And now what we have to do
01:49:24.280 here is we have to change the onsubmit
01:49:26.960 method to call the sign up method. And
01:49:30.080 we also need the name here. So
01:49:33.560 data.name. That's it. No errors at all.
01:49:37.199 And now in here we're going to change
01:49:39.360 instead of welcome back this will be let
01:49:42.639 and let's use at@ appos. So let's get
01:49:46.199 started. And this will be create your
01:49:51.560 account. The first field here will be
01:49:55.040 name. So you can copy the the entire
01:49:57.760 form field with the grid gap and paste
01:50:01.040 it
01:50:01.719 above. Change this name to be name and
01:50:05.280 this to be
01:50:06.600 name and the type can be text and this
01:50:09.600 can be John Doe for
01:50:14.119 example. So you can click sign up here
01:50:16.719 and you should be seeing that new form
01:50:18.800 which now has name here.
01:50:23.119 Now below this we have email below that
01:50:26.080 we have password and then copy the div
01:50:28.639 grid gap and the form
01:50:32.119 field. Paste it
01:50:34.679 below and change just the name here to
01:50:38.159 be confirm password. And well uh we
01:50:41.760 should also change this to be confirm
01:50:43.600 password I
01:50:45.880 guess. There we go. So let's just zoom
01:50:48.159 out a
01:50:49.159 bit. There we go.
01:50:52.560 So let's just try something
01:50:55.480 here. Let's try 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 4. There
01:51:00.239 we go. Passwords don't match. But if I
01:51:02.960 try 1, two, three, you can see that it
01:51:05.280 works. So let's try adding a new user
01:51:07.840 for example. And I will also prepare my
01:51:10.239 database here.
01:51:12.560 So what we can do of course is run mpm
01:51:16.880 run database studio
01:51:19.159 here which should get us you can click
01:51:22.080 this link and this should open the
01:51:23.600 studio then and in here I think I have
01:51:26.080 one user Antonio demo so let's go ahead
01:51:29.600 now and create a john john john john
01:51:32.239 john john john john john john john john
01:51:32.239 john john john john john john john john
01:51:32.320 john john john john john john john john
01:51:32.320 john john john john
01:51:33.159 johnondo.com and let's add 1 2 3 4 5 6
01:51:37.760 and let's do 1 2 3 4 5 6 I'm purposely
01:51:40.560 doing something wrong to see if This
01:51:42.239 will throw an error. There we go.
01:51:43.520 Password too short. So, let's add 78
01:51:47.800 78. And let's see what's going to happen
01:51:50.800 now. There we go. Logged in as John. And
01:51:55.199 if I go ahead and check uh my Drizzle
01:51:58.320 Studio here and refresh this and refresh
01:52:01.280 this. There we go. johndemo.com.
01:52:04.719 So, if I sign out now and if I go back
01:52:07.840 to sign in here, I should be able to log
01:52:10.960 in as John demo.com. Let's try an
01:52:14.080 invalid password
01:52:16.360 first. There we go. Let's try the
01:52:19.760 correct
01:52:20.599 password. And there we go. I'm logged
01:52:23.760 in. Perfect. So, we have completely uh
01:52:27.920 modified the form from the previous one.
01:52:30.400 Now it looks much better of course, but
01:52:32.880 there are some things we still have to
01:52:34.639 fix, including this one. Let's wrap up
01:52:36.719 the chapter with this. So inside your
01:52:38.639 sign up view, go down here and change
01:52:42.000 this to sign in and this to sign in. And
01:52:46.000 instead of don't have an account, it
01:52:47.760 will be already have an account. So now
01:52:51.040 you can switch between sign up and sign
01:52:53.360 in here. So what we have to do is we
01:52:55.840 have to improve this gradient a bit. I
01:52:57.920 don't like how it looks. And we have to
01:53:00.800 add proper icons for this. And of
01:53:02.880 course, we have to actually enable
01:53:04.159 Google and GitHub social signins, but
01:53:07.520 that will be for another chapter. And
01:53:09.599 also this button might need have might
01:53:12.560 need to have a different primary color.
01:53:15.119 We'll see about that later. But yes, you
01:53:18.719 can play around with the form. I'm
01:53:20.639 pretty satisfied with how it turned out.
01:53:23.440 Great. Let's go ahead now and wrap up
01:53:25.440 the chapter. We created the out pages,
01:53:27.920 out layout and the out module. We
01:53:30.159 created the out views. We got the
01:53:32.239 register login and the app logo. And now
01:53:34.480 let's create review and merge this pull
01:53:38.360 request. So what I'm going to do is uh
01:53:42.320 you can change your branch either from
01:53:44.960 using the three dots here and then
01:53:46.800 clicking check out too and but I think
01:53:49.280 you can also do clicking here and then
01:53:52.320 create a new branch from here. Maybe
01:53:53.840 that's easier. And let's call this 04
01:53:57.400 authentication UI. Let me just double
01:53:59.840 check it is 04 authentication UI. There
01:54:04.000 we go. I'm on my new branch. Now I will
01:54:06.320 go inside of the uh source control and I
01:54:09.679 will click plus here. Now all of these
01:54:12.400 are staged changes. I will add 04
01:54:15.800 authentication UI here. Confirm one more
01:54:19.280 time. I'm on the new branch and I will
01:54:21.040 click commit and publish branch. Now
01:54:24.400 let's head to
01:54:26.599 GitHub. Let's go ahead and open a pull
01:54:29.119 request here and create a pull request
01:54:32.159 and let's wait a second for our AI
01:54:35.040 reviewer to
01:54:37.400 start. And here we have our code
01:54:40.400 summary. So let's for change read the
01:54:43.280 walk through instead. This is a bit more
01:54:45.840 detailed. So this update introduces a
01:54:48.880 new authentication related react
01:54:50.639 components for signin and signup flows
01:54:53.040 including form validation and UI
01:54:55.040 layouts. We also add a layout wrapper
01:54:57.440 for authentication pages and we updated
01:55:00.159 the development script to remove the
01:55:02.159 turbo pack flag. So that's precisely
01:55:05.360 what we did in here. As always we have a
01:55:08.239 file by file change. And in here we have
01:55:10.719 an interesting sequence diagram. This is
01:55:12.719 what I was talking about. This will make
01:55:14.480 it easier for us to understand what we
01:55:16.560 just developed. So the user navigates to
01:55:19.360 sign in and that renders the signin view
01:55:22.320 component from the signin page. The user
01:55:25.520 submits email and password in the signin
01:55:28.000 view which is then sent through the out
01:55:30.800 client. Depending on success or failure,
01:55:34.159 we either redirect to home or we display
01:55:37.360 the error alert. And the same
01:55:39.679 functionality is for sign up view and
01:55:42.639 signup page. In here we have some
01:55:45.199 actionable comments here. And this is an
01:55:47.679 actual issue I forgot to do. So it
01:55:50.719 caught that in my sign up view. I forgot
01:55:54.080 to change the submit button label. It
01:55:56.800 still says sign in. So this is something
01:55:59.920 we're going to fix in the next chapter.
01:56:02.400 Great catch by Code Rabbit AI. And then
01:56:06.239 of course it gave us actionable advice
01:56:08.960 here to enable the social login. But
01:56:12.000 since we don't yet have them u
01:56:14.800 configured, we will not be doing that.
01:56:18.320 Nevertheless, let's go ahead and merge
01:56:20.800 this pull request. Once the pull request
01:56:24.560 is merged, you can go back to your IDE
01:56:28.480 here. Go ahead and click here and find
01:56:31.840 the main branch. Whether you will use
01:56:34.960 this main or origin main, it does not
01:56:39.040 matter. Just make sure it's main or if
01:56:42.000 you use anything else for your default
01:56:44.080 branch. And once you're there, click on
01:56:46.880 this button to pull and push commits
01:56:50.000 from origin main. This will make it
01:56:52.960 synchronized with everything else. So
01:56:55.119 there we go.
01:56:57.639 Perfect. Amazing. Amazing job. Now,
01:57:00.880 let's go ahead and mark this as
01:57:02.560 completed and see you in the next
01:57:06.440 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
01:57:09.040 go ahead and implement social provider
01:57:12.239 login for GitHub and Google. We're also
01:57:16.159 going to learn how to protect our
01:57:18.000 non-ALF
01:57:19.560 pages. Let's go ahead and check if you
01:57:23.040 are running your app. So, npm
01:57:27.000 rundev. After that, go to localhost
01:57:31.800 3000/sign. So, you're viewing the same
01:57:34.080 form as I am. After that, let's go to
01:57:37.679 better out. I would highly suggest that
01:57:40.239 you follow the documentation alongside
01:57:42.560 with me. Go inside of the
01:57:45.159 documentation authentication and find
01:57:48.440 GitHub. The reason I told you to follow
01:57:50.800 alongside is so you can copy the code
01:57:52.960 snippets, but also use the very useful
01:57:56.159 links they have added. So in here they
01:57:58.800 have prepared the redirect URL for us.
01:58:01.679 So go ahead and copy this. Click on
01:58:03.920 GitHub developer portal. It's located in
01:58:06.960 your settings developer settings. Click
01:58:09.760 new or out app. Let's call it meet AI
01:58:14.000 and authorization callback URL is the
01:58:16.560 redirect
01:58:17.639 URL. For the homepage URL, you can just
01:58:20.800 set the local host 3000. If you are
01:58:23.920 unsure if the protocol or the port are
01:58:27.239 correct, you can double check here. When
01:58:29.840 you run npm rundev, you can see your
01:58:32.639 local URL. If it's anything different,
01:58:35.520 for example, https or
01:58:38.280 3001, no problem. Just modify it here
01:58:41.760 and here. After you are ready, go ahead
01:58:44.880 and click register application. This
01:58:47.440 will uh allow you to copy the client ID.
01:58:50.320 So go to environment and add GitHub
01:58:52.719 client ID and prepare GitHub secret. My
01:58:57.199 apologies. GitHub client
01:59:00.520 secret. Go ahead and click generate a
01:59:03.440 new client secret and copy
01:59:06.520 it. Go ahead and paste it
01:59:09.080 here. And that's all you need. Now what
01:59:12.480 we have to do is configure the provider.
01:59:14.560 So let's go ahead and copy the social
01:59:16.239 providers here.
01:59:18.639 Now let's go inside of source lib out
01:59:23.199 and go ahead and add the social
01:59:25.280 providers
01:59:27.480 here. Make sure that you have added the
01:59:29.920 client ID and the client secret for the
01:59:32.159 GitHub social provider. As always, what
01:59:35.360 I like to do is copy from here and then
01:59:38.719 paste here just to double check. So copy
01:59:41.920 from here and paste here. The reason I
01:59:45.360 always advise doing this is in case you
01:59:47.760 misspelled this, for example, like this.
01:59:50.719 You can't really see it immediately, but
01:59:53.119 this is a different variable, right? I
01:59:56.239 missed the letter T, for example. So,
01:59:58.320 that's why you always copy from here and
02:00:00.719 paste
02:00:02.199 here. Great. Now, let's go to sign in
02:00:05.480 view and find your or continue with
02:00:10.000 part. Find your two buttons Google and
02:00:13.159 GitHub and go ahead and add on click
02:00:16.760 here and simply call our client sign in
02:00:21.960 social and add the provider and set it
02:00:25.760 to
02:00:27.480 GitHub like this.
02:00:30.320 So now if you go to your sign in view
02:00:33.199 here and click on GitHub regardless if
02:00:36.239 you are trying to register or log in uh
02:00:39.360 all out works the same way. If the user
02:00:42.000 doesn't exist it will create it. If it
02:00:44.480 does exist it will just log in. So it
02:00:46.639 does not matter that we are doing this
02:00:48.480 from the signin page. Also double check
02:00:51.440 that you didn't accidentally register
02:00:54.080 with your existing GitHub email. If you
02:00:56.800 have, go ahead and remove that user from
02:00:58.960 your database. You can visit Dusel
02:01:00.880 Studio or Neon Tables. So, let's click
02:01:03.760 GitHub here. And in a few seconds, we
02:01:06.000 should see the authorization screen.
02:01:08.239 Let's authorize. And I should now be
02:01:11.080 redirected back to the homepage here. If
02:01:14.639 you, for whatever reason, were not
02:01:16.239 redirected, you can manually go to
02:01:18.400 localhost 3000 here. Wait a second, and
02:01:20.800 you will see your GitHub username right
02:01:23.360 here. Great. Now let's go ahead and
02:01:25.840 let's sign out. Let's go back to sign in
02:01:28.679 here. So what I want to do now is I want
02:01:31.599 to copy this here and I want to go to
02:01:34.639 sign up view. Find the GitHub button
02:01:38.119 here and add the on click here. So now
02:01:41.679 both from the sign up and from the sign
02:01:43.840 in GitHub should
02:01:45.960 work. What we have to do now is the
02:01:49.199 Google login.
02:01:51.280 Let's go ahead and click on Google here
02:01:53.679 and let's go inside of the Google Cloud
02:01:56.360 Console. So before you do anything here,
02:01:59.119 what you have to do is create a new
02:02:01.040 project. Using your navbar, you can
02:02:03.199 select your current project. And in here
02:02:05.199 you can click new project. I'm going to
02:02:08.000 go ahead and call this
02:02:11.320 meet
02:02:12.840 AI. You don't have to select any
02:02:15.159 organization. And go ahead and click
02:02:17.800 create. And now just wait for your
02:02:20.639 project to be created. It should be done
02:02:23.440 in a second and click select
02:02:27.320 project. Now you will see your project
02:02:30.400 name here in the project picker. And if
02:02:33.599 you try clicking on these credentials or
02:02:36.800 oath consent screens, uh you will
02:02:39.520 probably at one point be redirected to
02:02:42.480 this Google out platform. That's because
02:02:45.440 I've noticed that Google is in some kind
02:02:47.679 of migration phase where they are
02:02:49.599 introducing this Google AL platform. So
02:02:52.400 to make this easier for you to follow,
02:02:55.280 let's follow from the actual better AL
02:02:57.920 documentation. So let's together click
02:02:59.840 on Google Cloud Console that seems to
02:03:02.560 take us to APIs and services here. And
02:03:05.679 usually what you would do is you would
02:03:07.440 go and create the credentials. But in
02:03:10.159 here I have this warning. Remember to
02:03:12.239 configure the Oout screen. uh before we
02:03:15.440 create the credentials. So usually you
02:03:18.239 would click here right and as you can
02:03:20.800 see that takes me to Google out platform
02:03:24.159 and tells me that the Google out
02:03:26.480 platform is not configured yet. So
02:03:29.199 basically you need to find a way to
02:03:31.280 configure the out platform. I just
02:03:33.119 showed you one way of getting to here
02:03:35.520 and then click get started here and that
02:03:38.400 basically takes you to the overview. So
02:03:40.400 let's call this app meet AI. Let's use
02:03:43.840 whatever you have for the user support
02:03:45.920 email and click next. For your audience,
02:03:48.800 select external so that anyone can test
02:03:51.199 the app. Go ahead and click next and
02:03:53.920 enter your uh contact email address here
02:03:57.440 and click next. Agree to the terms and
02:03:59.840 service and continue and click
02:04:03.080 create. And this will set up the Google
02:04:06.239 AL platform right here. So what I would
02:04:10.000 suggest you do now uh is click on
02:04:13.040 branding just to see everything's okay.
02:04:15.599 So the app name is meet AI. This is the
02:04:18.320 support email. And here's an advice. Do
02:04:21.280 not add a logo. If you add a logo, you
02:04:24.320 will need to submit your app for
02:04:25.840 verification which can take some time.
02:04:28.560 So don't add any logos. Do you don't
02:04:30.880 have to add anything here. I'm just
02:04:32.719 checking that the name is correct. Now
02:04:35.520 let's click through audience here. And
02:04:37.520 this is important. Before you create the
02:04:39.840 credential, click on the publish app
02:04:42.159 push to production. So here here it is.
02:04:45.920 If your app's configuration has more
02:04:47.599 than 10 domains or if it has a logo or
02:04:51.199 request sensitive or restricted scopes,
02:04:53.679 you will need to submit for
02:04:55.000 verification. So that's why I told you
02:04:57.119 to not add a logo because this way you
02:05:00.800 can just push to production like this.
02:05:02.719 That's it. That's all you have to do.
02:05:04.960 Make sure this says external here. And
02:05:08.080 now let's go inside of the clients here.
02:05:10.239 And now we can finally click create
02:05:13.800 client. In here, go ahead and select web
02:05:16.960 application. And go ahead and call this
02:05:20.239 meet AI. And now in here, select add
02:05:24.800 authorized redirect URIs. And in here,
02:05:27.440 you can just copy this one.
02:05:33.599 Let's go here and let's add it here. So
02:05:36.159 double check the protocol and the port
02:05:38.080 and click create. And this will now show
02:05:41.199 you your client ID and your client
02:05:44.679 secret. So let's go ahead and add to
02:05:46.880 Google client
02:05:49.000 ID and Google client
02:05:55.000 secret. There we go. Make sure you have
02:05:57.920 both of them here and click okay.
02:06:01.760 And now you're ready to go inside of
02:06:04.000 your sign in view here. Copy the on
02:06:07.199 click. Go to
02:06:10.280 Google and add the Google provider here.
02:06:15.440 Go to the sign up view and do the same
02:06:19.159 thing. Now let's go ahead and try it
02:06:21.599 out. So I'm going to go ahead and click
02:06:24.080 Google. It doesn't matter from sign up
02:06:26.159 or from sign in. Let's click Google. And
02:06:28.800 let's wait a second.
02:06:30.960 This should uh open up the Google
02:06:35.719 login. Let me try refreshing or maybe
02:06:38.639 there is an error. Maybe we did
02:06:40.079 something
02:06:43.719 incorrectly. Well, we did something
02:06:46.320 incorrectly most certainly. And what I
02:06:49.360 don't like is that we are not getting
02:06:50.880 any Oops, I just clicked GitHub. Uh no,
02:06:53.760 no, no. I don't want to log in with
02:06:55.119 GitHub. So, basically, we are not
02:06:57.280 getting the errors here. So what I want
02:06:59.360 to do here is set error to be
02:07:03.400 null. And then in here I'm going to do
02:07:06.960 on
02:07:09.320 error. How about we let's standardize
02:07:13.280 this, shall we? So okay, go inside of
02:07:16.960 sign up view right
02:07:19.719 here and you can copy the onsubmit
02:07:23.360 method entirely.
02:07:26.800 Paste it below itself and rename this on
02:07:30.760 social. Change this to be provider.
02:07:34.719 Change it to GitHub or Google. Set the
02:07:39.920 error to null and the pending to true.
02:07:42.159 Change this from email to social and
02:07:45.040 simply pass the provider. As you can see
02:07:47.599 the
02:07:48.840 provider it has to be sign in dosocial.
02:07:52.400 So even in the sign up view you have to
02:07:54.719 use the sign in for the onsocial. So the
02:07:57.599 provider type can be all of these as you
02:08:00.800 can see when I hover it's an
02:08:03.079 enum not an enium sorry it's this type
02:08:06.239 of type. So this actually matches so I
02:08:09.360 can just set the provider prop here and
02:08:11.920 the error goes
02:08:14.040 away. And in here you can set the
02:08:17.840 pending false here and set the error
02:08:19.599 message here like this. And then you can
02:08:21.280 use the on social in the buttons below.
02:08:25.119 So let's try it like that. Or sign in
02:08:27.199 with and let's
02:08:29.960 do on social
02:08:33.880 Google and in
02:08:36.040 here on social
02:08:39.480 GitHub. So now what I would like to do
02:08:42.000 is copy the on social here. Go to sign
02:08:45.040 in view here.
02:08:51.199 and keep it like
02:08:53.320 this. And then just change these as
02:08:56.599 well. So on social
02:09:01.159 Google and in here on social GitHub. So
02:09:06.560 now the reason I did this is because
02:09:08.239 when you click on Google, it should now
02:09:10.320 say provider not found. That's because
02:09:12.719 we actually forgot to add the provider
02:09:15.199 here. So let's quickly do that.
02:09:18.480 Let's add
02:09:19.560 Google to our alph.ts where we just
02:09:23.119 added GitHub. So, let's just add Google
02:09:25.119 below this. And as always, let's double
02:09:28.000 check
02:09:29.800 this. So, Google client
02:09:32.360 ID.
02:09:34.280 Oops. So, copy
02:09:36.679 this, paste it
02:09:38.679 here, copy this, paste it
02:09:42.440 here. And now, let's go ahead and try
02:09:44.719 again. Google
02:09:47.280 There we go. Let's click on this one.
02:09:50.320 Let's click continue. And I should now
02:09:52.480 be logged in as John Doe. There we go.
02:09:55.520 So, what I want to do now is I don't
02:09:57.360 know if you've noticed, but even before
02:09:59.920 I selected my account, I already got
02:10:02.000 redirected to the root page. That's
02:10:04.400 probably because of the way this on
02:10:07.760 social
02:10:09.320 here handles the on success. So I think
02:10:12.639 on success here might be just
02:10:16.239 successfully making the oalf request. So
02:10:19.119 it already pushes me here which is not
02:10:21.119 good because at this point the user
02:10:22.639 would not be logged in. So what we can
02:10:25.679 do here is add a callback
02:10:27.960 URL like
02:10:29.960 this and I just want to confirm. Let me
02:10:33.679 just check inside of better
02:10:36.440 out. Can I search for call back
02:10:44.280 URL? As you can see, we can also do it
02:10:47.040 like
02:10:48.760 this. I'm trying to find the fallback
02:10:53.440 URL. Okay, so we can use relative
02:10:55.920 imports, relative URL. I was wondering
02:10:58.239 if I need to do the whole local host or
02:11:00.239 not. And then I'm going to remove the
02:11:02.800 router.push from here. So that's in the
02:11:04.719 signin view.
02:11:06.560 Let's do the same thing for the sign up
02:11:08.079 view. So remove router.push here and add
02:11:11.280 call back URL to forward slash. And how
02:11:15.360 about we do the same thing for sign up
02:11:17.679 with
02:11:19.000 email. So we can add call back URL. So
02:11:22.159 we don't have to do router.push which
02:11:24.400 means we don't have to use router which
02:11:26.719 means we don't need the next navigation
02:11:28.760 import. And do the same thing in the
02:11:30.880 signin
02:11:31.880 view. So in the onsubmit sign in with
02:11:35.280 email remove router.push and add a call
02:11:38.000 back URL to be a forward slash remove
02:11:41.280 use router and remove next
02:11:44.840 navigation. So let's go ahead back to /
02:11:47.840 signin now and let's try logging it with
02:11:51.880 GitHub. So I should now only be
02:11:54.199 redirected in the call back. There we
02:11:56.960 go. Perfect. So I think that now we can
02:12:00.079 officially mark this as completed. Now
02:12:02.880 let's learn how to protect our non pages
02:12:06.159 here. So I think we can finally now go
02:12:08.639 inside of source app folder page and
02:12:11.280 remove this entire
02:12:16.360 thing div homepage. We can remove all of
02:12:20.480 this
02:12:23.400 imports. The only thing I would actually
02:12:26.000 like to leave here. Yeah, let me just
02:12:28.400 revert it a bit. Sorry for telling you
02:12:29.920 to remove it. I mean, I just I'm just
02:12:31.599 using it so I have so I can copy these
02:12:33.360 two
02:12:34.199 things. This is the only thing I care
02:12:41.800 about. There we go. So I just want this
02:12:44.480 to be here which means that uh I need to
02:12:47.520 get data session from out client use
02:12:53.320 session and I need to mark this as use
02:12:57.400 client and I need to import button from
02:13:01.760 components UI
02:13:03.560 button and in
02:13:05.719 here if there is no session
02:13:10.440 return loading
02:13:14.520 Okay. So, make sure you've marked this
02:13:16.639 as use client and I just want this. I
02:13:18.400 don't need the entire form or anything.
02:13:21.360 So, the problem now is uh as you can
02:13:24.639 see, well, I didn't really handle this
02:13:26.320 correctly, right? Because there is no
02:13:28.560 session here. So, I just return loading.
02:13:31.840 But I actually want to handle it a
02:13:33.280 little bit differently. So, this is how
02:13:34.560 we would do it. Let's go inside of
02:13:36.639 source modules and I will just create a
02:13:38.880 home module.
02:13:41.360 And inside of the home module, I will
02:13:43.920 create a UI folder. And then I will
02:13:46.560 create views. And this will be a home
02:13:51.159 view.tsx. So that will actually be this
02:13:53.760 page
02:13:55.079 here. Let's paste it here. And let's
02:13:57.520 just export con home view here. And we
02:14:01.679 can remove the default export entirely.
02:14:04.719 So this can be the use client part right
02:14:08.239 in our home module here. home view. So
02:14:12.159 now we are free to use our server
02:14:14.960 component here as an actual server
02:14:17.199 component. So we can remove everything
02:14:20.040 here and just use it as a server
02:14:23.239 component. So inside of here what we
02:14:26.000 would do is we would return home view
02:14:29.920 like this. So right now it should work
02:14:33.119 exactly the same. It's displaying
02:14:34.719 loading because I didn't do any out here
02:14:40.239 to I didn't I I basically if there's no
02:14:42.719 session I just say it's loading right so
02:14:46.000 what I want to do instead is use a
02:14:48.159 server component to redirect the user
02:14:51.840 back to my AL pages and the reason I
02:14:54.560 want to use a server component for that
02:14:56.239 is well so we learn how to use the
02:14:58.560 server uh util of better AL and simply
02:15:02.320 because it's better to redirect direct
02:15:03.840 from the server side than from a client
02:15:05.840 component. If we already have server
02:15:08.400 components, right? Why not use them to
02:15:10.800 for what they're good
02:15:12.840 at? So let's go ahead and get the
02:15:16.159 session here using await which means
02:15:18.880 that we have to turn this into an
02:15:20.400 asynchronous component. Let's import out
02:15:23.679 from lib out. So not outclient out
02:15:26.639 directly API.get session. And inside of
02:15:30.560 the session here we have to pass the
02:15:32.360 headers. So this can be await headers
02:15:35.280 from next headers and execute them. It's
02:15:38.639 a function. Make sure you don't have use
02:15:41.440 client here in the page. And then if
02:15:44.159 there is no session redirect using next
02:15:48.040 navigation to
02:15:51.159 /signin. There we go.
02:15:54.480 So now you don't really have to worry
02:15:56.719 about this because never will a user see
02:16:00.800 the home view client component even
02:16:03.440 being rendered if they don't have a
02:16:05.679 session. So yes, this is technically
02:16:08.159 correct way of doing it now because in
02:16:10.800 here we are going to detect that there
02:16:12.719 is no session sooner than we detected
02:16:15.119 that there is no session here because
02:16:17.360 this is a fetch request whereas this is
02:16:20.400 an actual deconstruction of the header
02:16:23.239 parameters. So if I try manually going
02:16:26.320 to logos 3000 now you can see that I am
02:16:29.040 redirected back. I cannot see the
02:16:31.280 homepage anymore. But if I click on
02:16:34.160 GitHub for example, let's wait. Let's
02:16:37.478 wait. There we go. Logged in as Antonio.
02:16:41.040 So now I can visit the homepage. What I
02:16:44.398 want to do now is I want to do the
02:16:47.280 reverse of this. So I'm going to go
02:16:49.840 ahead and just copy this pattern and I'm
02:16:53.359 going to go inside of source app out
02:16:56.558 signin page.tsx dsx and I'm going to add
02:16:59.920 this here and turn this into an
02:17:01.599 asynchronous method and I'm going to
02:17:03.599 import out from lib out and I'm going to
02:17:06.478 import headers from next
02:17:09.879 headers and I'm going to import redirect
02:17:13.200 from next navigation and in here I will
02:17:15.359 do the opposite logic if the session
02:17:18.398 already exists so what I can do is turn
02:17:21.040 it into a boolean by adding double
02:17:23.359 exclamation points this will redirect
02:17:25.840 the user back to the root page
02:17:28.240 or to the homepage.
02:17:30.359 Right? So now I will just indent this
02:17:33.638 properly. I will copy this again. I will
02:17:36.240 go instead of sign up here and I will do
02:17:38.240 the same thing
02:17:39.879 here.
02:17:42.040 Async out lib
02:17:45.080 out
02:17:47.799 headers.
02:17:49.959 Whoops. Next. headers and
02:17:56.359 redirect. There we go. Like
02:17:59.318 this. So now if you are logged in like I
02:18:03.760 am, you should not be able to visit
02:18:06.000 slashsign in for example. You can see
02:18:08.398 I'm immediately redirected
02:18:11.240 back to my homepage. But if I sign out
02:18:16.799 uh oh yes, I didn't properly do this. So
02:18:21.478 uh this will not actively look for my
02:18:25.599 session. So that's why this did not
02:18:27.439 redirect after I signed out. But
02:18:30.080 thankfully that's why our sign out
02:18:32.398 offers us
02:18:34.478 uh a on success fetch options which is
02:18:37.519 an
02:18:38.439 object on
02:18:40.599 success and then in here we can do
02:18:43.478 router which we have to add con router
02:18:47.519 use router from next navigation and let
02:18:50.080 me just open this so you can see better
02:18:52.478 how it looks
02:18:56.439 like. So fetch
02:18:59.879 options
02:19:02.359 router.push sign
02:19:08.760 in like
02:19:13.879 this. So let's try this again. So I can
02:19:17.280 now visit sign up and visit sign in. But
02:19:20.638 I cannot visit the homepage. I
02:19:22.959 immediately get redirected back here.
02:19:25.120 But if I log
02:19:26.439 in, I should get redirected back to the
02:19:30.359 homepage. When I am logged in, I cannot
02:19:33.679 visit sign
02:19:35.240 in and I cannot visit sign up. Both of
02:19:39.519 them are protected. But if I sign out, I
02:19:42.398 should now get redirected. There we go.
02:19:45.760 So that's how we're going to use this
02:19:47.519 onsuccess method here. Perfect. Uh, so
02:19:51.760 you probably have a question here.
02:19:55.200 Um, can we somehow reuse this? Can we
02:20:00.000 somehow put this maybe in a layout? And
02:20:02.240 then this way we can protect the entire
02:20:04.479 AL route group. I please do not do that.
02:20:08.240 Um, it is much much safer to explicitly
02:20:10.960 protect routes rather than use the
02:20:13.359 middleware or try and find a way to
02:20:16.720 protect multiple things at once. It's
02:20:18.800 always better to have explicit
02:20:20.479 protection. there's been a number of
02:20:22.160 issues in the middleware in the layout
02:20:25.200 uh and those were security issues. So
02:20:27.359 basically people were able to bypass
02:20:29.120 middlewarees and bypass the layout
02:20:31.160 protection. But the thing is uh you you
02:20:34.640 never should have relied on things like
02:20:36.880 that. So using out in the middleware or
02:20:39.120 in the layout is not inherently wrong if
02:20:41.760 you want to improve user experience, if
02:20:43.520 you want to show them, hey, you're not
02:20:45.040 logged in. So, it's not wrong to do
02:20:47.439 that, but that shouldn't be your last
02:20:49.840 line of defense, right? You should
02:20:51.600 always have another explicit redirect in
02:20:55.200 the actual page you're doing. In our
02:20:57.520 case, we don't even need these redirects
02:21:01.359 because we're going to be implementing
02:21:03.040 TRPC in this tutorial and we're going to
02:21:05.200 have protected procedures. So, our
02:21:07.520 entire backend and API will be strictly
02:21:10.399 protected. The only reason I'm even
02:21:12.720 doing this redirects are for good user
02:21:15.200 experience, right? So, if you're asking,
02:21:17.840 can I use the middleware? Can I use the
02:21:19.600 layouts, you probably can. There's
02:21:21.359 probably documentation, but I would not
02:21:23.600 suggest doing that because people then
02:21:26.000 uh completely avoid doing any kind of
02:21:28.640 actual authentication protection. So, I
02:21:31.840 will be teaching direct explicit uh
02:21:34.479 authentication like this in
02:21:36.760 pages. Great. So now that we have that
02:21:40.160 ready, what I just want to do is add the
02:21:43.520 icons here and also you know just for I
02:21:46.479 want to check if my actual uh normal
02:21:49.520 registration is working. So let's try
02:21:53.080 Johndemo.com
02:21:55.960 password. I want to see if these things
02:21:59.359 are working or not. Let's see. So, looks
02:22:02.080 like I was uh registered, but it did not
02:22:06.000 redirect me. Only once I refresh did it
02:22:10.160 redirect me. That's interesting. Okay,
02:22:12.960 so looks like that in my This is why
02:22:15.359 it's always good to test. So, go inside
02:22:18.479 of your sign up view here. And to fix
02:22:20.600 that, you should go inside of uh sign up
02:22:23.600 by email here. You can leave the
02:22:25.760 callback URL to be this. But looks like
02:22:28.000 we are going to need the router which we
02:22:31.040 removed. So
02:22:33.240 const router use router from next
02:22:37.399 navigation. Let's go ahead and add it
02:22:40.840 here and simply on success after set is
02:22:45.280 pending router.push to the root page
02:22:48.080 like this. And you don't need to add it
02:22:50.800 for the social login because that seems
02:22:52.720 to be working correctly.
02:22:56.399 Perfect. So that will now work. Go
02:22:58.479 inside of sign in and you have to do the
02:23:00.800 same
02:23:05.640 thing. Next
02:23:09.080 navigation. Go ahead and add the router
02:23:13.479 here. Oops.
02:23:18.800 And in the normal onsubmit
02:23:21.880 here do router
02:23:25.080 push and go
02:23:27.319 here like
02:23:29.640 this. So I think that now this should be
02:23:33.040 working. So if I sign out here and if I
02:23:35.359 go into
02:23:36.600 johndemo.com and password and sign in I
02:23:40.479 should get redirected and I am perfect.
02:23:43.520 If I go inside of sign up here and try a
02:23:45.920 new
02:23:52.200 one and sign in, I should get redirected
02:23:55.600 as well. There we go. Looks like
02:23:58.880 everything is working nicely. GitHub
02:24:01.520 will use the call back and my social and
02:24:05.520 my credential will use the router push.
02:24:08.800 This seems to be working just fine.
02:24:11.040 Perfect. All that's left to do is to add
02:24:13.280 the icons and we can close this chapter.
02:24:16.160 So go ahead and do npm install react
02:24:19.240 icons d- legacy here deps. The reason
02:24:23.200 I'm adding these icons is simply because
02:24:25.600 they have Google and GitHub icons. If
02:24:28.640 you're wondering about the version of
02:24:30.080 this
02:24:33.160 package, it is 5.5.0.
02:24:37.120 Let's go inside of the signin
02:24:39.240 view and let's import FA GitHub and FA
02:24:44.280 Google from React
02:24:47.800 icons. Copy this immediately inside of
02:24:50.560 the sign up
02:24:55.160 view. Go back inside of the signin view.
02:24:58.800 Find your GitHub
02:25:02.200 button and add FA GitHub here.
02:25:07.359 and replace the Google text with FA
02:25:12.600 Google. And then do the same thing.
02:25:15.439 Let's just see what the error is about.
02:25:17.120 Oops. Slash FA. That's the full import.
02:25:20.960 Same thing here. /ash
02:25:23.720 FA. Go ahead and find the Google here or
02:25:28.000 GitHub. FA
02:25:32.280 GitHub and FA Google
02:25:36.520 here. And there we go. Now we have nice
02:25:39.840 icons and everything is working. Social
02:25:42.680 login, redirects, outs, routes are
02:25:45.800 protected, everything is working just
02:25:48.080 fine. Amazing, amazing job. So we
02:25:50.720 learned how to protect non-out pages.
02:25:52.640 And now let's go ahead and merge this
02:25:54.399 pull request. So what I'm going to do is
02:25:57.280 the following. I have nine unsaved
02:26:00.640 changes
02:26:01.720 here. I mean uncommitted changes. So I'm
02:26:04.640 going to do is I'm going to click on my
02:26:06.000 branch here. I will click create new
02:26:09.040 branch and I will call this 05
02:26:12.560 uh authentication socials. And I will
02:26:15.359 just confirm that that's the name. Here
02:26:18.479 it
02:26:20.600 is. I will add all of my changes. Just
02:26:23.840 confirm you are on the new branch. I
02:26:26.240 will add all changes. So now they become
02:26:28.479 staged changes and I will add 05
02:26:31.720 authentication socials and I will click
02:26:34.960 commit and publish
02:26:37.800 branch. Now we can go to
02:26:41.160 GitHub right
02:26:43.240 here and we can open this pull request.
02:26:47.680 Let's create the pull request here. And
02:26:50.800 let's wait for our AI reviewer to review
02:26:53.840 our
02:26:56.120 code. And here we have our code summary.
02:26:59.840 So new features. We added social login
02:27:02.560 options via Google and GitHub on sign in
02:27:05.520 and sign up pages. We have introduced a
02:27:08.080 new home view displaying user
02:27:09.600 information and sign out functionality.
02:27:12.560 We improved authentication flow with
02:27:14.560 serverside detection and automatic
02:27:16.880 redirects for authent authenticated
02:27:19.040 users. We have updated UI to use icons
02:27:22.720 to use icon buttons for social login
02:27:25.560 options. So in here of course we have a
02:27:28.319 more detailed walk through and we also
02:27:30.880 have a very big sequence diagram
02:27:33.439 explaining how our new session detection
02:27:35.840 works, how our social login works. So
02:27:38.720 you can pause and take a look at this if
02:27:40.399 you are interested or need further
02:27:42.319 explanation about
02:27:43.720 that. Now in here we have some usual
02:27:46.399 comments. Uh code rabbit uh well very
02:27:50.080 intelligently suggests that we should
02:27:52.160 add a runtime validation for required
02:27:55.160 environment variables. So if you want to
02:27:57.760 yeah you can go ahead and you know
02:27:59.600 implement this kind of get environment
02:28:01.359 variable function which will check if it
02:28:03.200 doesn't exist and then throw an error on
02:28:05.920 time. Um, but I I'm pretty confident in
02:28:09.439 doing it this way. Um, I don't think
02:28:12.319 there's anything we need to change
02:28:14.200 here, at least not for, you know,
02:28:16.640 development here. Uh, in here, I'm not
02:28:19.359 exactly sure that we use invalid fetch
02:28:22.399 options on success. Um maybe this was in
02:28:26.399 the previous versions of better out but
02:28:28.399 in the newer versions of better out I'm
02:28:30.800 pretty sure
02:28:32.359 that sign out
02:28:35.240 here offers fetch options on success. So
02:28:39.920 we are definitely doing a proper
02:28:43.280 redirect here. So that's
02:28:45.479 fine. Uh so I will resolve this
02:28:49.160 conversation. Now in here it is telling
02:28:52.000 us that on social success handle should
02:28:54.800 redirect and this is a completely valid
02:28:57.920 uh you know thing to to comment on. I'm
02:29:00.880 pretty sure a human reviewer would
02:29:02.800 notice that that's missing here as well.
02:29:05.120 That's because we noticed that when
02:29:07.200 using social it is smarter to rely on
02:29:09.840 the call back URL rather than the
02:29:12.640 router. push in the on success because
02:29:14.720 the on success with the social sign in
02:29:17.439 is you have successfully sent a Oout
02:29:21.359 request but you you were not actually
02:29:24.000 authenticated just yet that's why it's
02:29:26.560 better to use callback URL so this is
02:29:28.479 also fine I will resolve this and in
02:29:31.600 here uh I don't think it has the new API
02:29:36.080 headers are now asynchronous this was a
02:29:38.800 recent change in nextJS so that is okay
02:29:42.000 as Well, but still uh very very smart
02:29:45.840 suggestions. It's good to have a sanity
02:29:48.000 check on our changes here. So, I will
02:29:50.960 just resolve everything. There we go.
02:29:53.760 Let's go ahead and merge
02:29:55.479 this. Confirm
02:29:58.120 merge. And then let's go back here.
02:30:00.960 Let's go inside of main. Again, you can
02:30:03.200 use main or you can use origin main. It
02:30:06.240 won't matter because you will click on
02:30:08.160 this little button here and you will
02:30:10.479 push and pull commits from origin main.
02:30:13.359 And this way if you go ahead and look at
02:30:15.680 your graph you will see that you have
02:30:17.840 just merged 05 authentication socials
02:30:21.200 into your main branch here. And of
02:30:24.479 course you can check it yourself. For
02:30:26.080 example go inside of app page and in
02:30:29.280 here we have the redirect which we just
02:30:31.520 developed in that branch. Amazing
02:30:34.080 amazing job. That marks the end of this
02:30:36.160 chapter and see you in the next
02:30:39.000 one. In this chapter, we're going to go
02:30:41.760 ahead and develop the dashboard sidebar.
02:30:44.560 This will include creating the layout
02:30:46.560 module, the actual sidebar component,
02:30:49.120 modifying the global CSS to obtain our
02:30:52.080 theme and then using those new themes to
02:30:55.439 fix the gradient colors in our
02:30:57.439 authentication views. So, our sidebar
02:31:00.399 will look something like this. a logo at
02:31:03.600 top, meetings and agents items here, and
02:31:07.439 then an upgrade item here. Down here,
02:31:10.640 we're going to have the currently logged
02:31:12.399 in user and the drop down for the user
02:31:14.560 to log out. Later, this dashboard
02:31:18.640 sidebar will also have the free trial
02:31:21.520 status, but it doesn't make sense to
02:31:23.280 develop it now because we don't have any
02:31:25.280 data to work with. So, let's start with
02:31:28.399 creating the actual dashboard layout.
02:31:31.439 So, as always, just make sure you have
02:31:33.200 your app running, npm rundev, and let's
02:31:37.359 go ahead and check out how our app
02:31:39.200 currently works. So, right now, go ahead
02:31:41.520 and log in using either a social
02:31:43.760 provider or email and password
02:31:46.520 credentials. And you need to be on your
02:31:49.359 dashboard page. So, basically, this page
02:31:51.600 with the big sign out button, which
02:31:53.680 tells you logged in as whoever you're
02:31:56.399 logged in with. So, that is currently
02:31:59.200 displayed.
02:32:01.280 on this route right here, localhost
02:32:04.720 3000, just the root page. And it's this
02:32:07.280 page right here, the home view. Right?
02:32:10.080 So, what we have to do now is the
02:32:11.760 following. Inside of your app folder, we
02:32:14.080 are going to create a route group called
02:32:17.640 dashboard. And since you've already
02:32:20.840 learned, whenever you create a new
02:32:23.040 folder in parenthesis inside of the
02:32:25.120 Nex.js GS app folder. That means this is
02:32:28.720 not a part of the URL. It is simply a
02:32:33.040 grouping folder. And what you can do is
02:32:36.720 you can actually drag and drop your main
02:32:39.920 root page tsx and put it inside of here
02:32:43.359 like this. If you're being asked to
02:32:45.600 update the imports, you can select yes.
02:32:48.240 If you still end up with one unsaved
02:32:50.479 file, it's most likely the next types
02:32:53.439 app file. You can just go inside and
02:32:55.680 click save and close it. And then make
02:32:58.160 sure you close the next folder so you
02:33:00.560 don't accidentally continue developing
02:33:02.520 here. The next folder uh restarts and
02:33:06.160 rebuilds every time you do npm rundev.
02:33:08.560 So no worries. Even if you've messed
02:33:10.640 something up, you can just delete this
02:33:12.800 folder if you want to and just restart
02:33:15.760 your server and it's going to be
02:33:17.640 rebuilt. It's not going to affect the
02:33:19.840 actual production of the app. So what
02:33:22.319 we've done now is we moved our
02:33:25.240 page.tsx from the app folder into the
02:33:28.520 dashboard route group. So what changes
02:33:32.160 now? Well, absolutely nothing. But what
02:33:35.760 we can now do is we can create a layout
02:33:39.200 which is specific for this dashboard
02:33:41.840 route group. So we don't have to use
02:33:45.520 this global layout here, right? Because
02:33:48.960 this is the root layout. This is
02:33:50.479 something else. We don't want to add the
02:33:52.319 sidebar here because I don't want to
02:33:54.960 have my sidebar active at all times. I
02:33:57.920 only want it active for sites or routes
02:34:02.080 which belong in the dashboard route
02:34:04.240 group. So that's why we did this
02:34:06.359 decision. Let's go inside of here and
02:34:08.640 let's quickly create a layout inside of
02:34:12.000 here. Simply pass the children. And now
02:34:16.240 let's go ahead and create the interface
02:34:19.000 props children react react
02:34:23.640 node. Go ahead inside of here and the
02:34:27.359 structure the
02:34:30.040 children. And still nothing should
02:34:32.960 change because we don't add any new
02:34:35.200 styles to this layout. But you should
02:34:37.920 still test it just to confirm you didn't
02:34:40.399 break anything.
02:34:42.319 So what we're going to do now in the
02:34:44.240 layout is the following. We're going to
02:34:46.880 go ahead and change this to be a sidebar
02:34:49.720 provider from components UI sidebar. So
02:34:53.200 yes, we also added the sidebar
02:34:55.200 components when we added chats and UI.
02:34:57.840 Make sure to double check that you have
02:34:59.600 the sidebar component in your source
02:35:01.600 components UI sidebar. If it's missing,
02:35:04.479 make sure to revisit chapter one where
02:35:08.080 we actually uh set up Shad and UI and
02:35:12.399 added
02:35:14.520 components. Great. So now we're going to
02:35:17.600 go ahead and do the following. We are
02:35:19.920 going to wrap our children inside of a
02:35:23.760 main and give the main a class name of
02:35:27.319 flex, flex column, height of screen,
02:35:31.520 width of screen, and background color of
02:35:35.640 muted. And then we're going to go ahead
02:35:38.479 and create a dashboard sidebar
02:35:43.720 component. This will be created and
02:35:46.080 maintained inside of the modules. So,
02:35:48.720 let's go ahead and create a dashboard
02:35:51.359 module here. Let's go ahead and create
02:35:54.040 UI. And let's go ahead and create
02:35:56.359 components. And inside of here,
02:35:59.120 dashboard dash
02:36:03.160 sidebar.tsx like this. Go ahead and mark
02:36:06.399 this as use client. And now, let's go
02:36:08.960 ahead and import everything we need from
02:36:11.040 components UI sidebar. So, the same path
02:36:13.920 as this one. sidebar, content, footer,
02:36:17.439 group, group content, header, menu, menu
02:36:20.560 button, and menu item. Just like that.
02:36:24.560 Now, let's define our first section of
02:36:28.160 items here. So, it's going to be an
02:36:30.240 array of items which have an icon video
02:36:33.880 icon, a label, which will say meetings,
02:36:38.080 and an href which will be the actual
02:36:40.319 path / meetings.
02:36:43.840 Then we're going to have an icon bot
02:36:46.160 icon from Lucid React label of agents
02:36:50.880 and an href of forward slash
02:36:54.920 agents. And then let's go ahead and copy
02:36:57.439 this, paste it, and rename it second
02:37:01.399 section. This one will just have one
02:37:03.840 item star icon from Lucid React and the
02:37:07.359 label upgrade and an href forward
02:37:10.399 slashupgrade.
02:37:12.479 Make sure you have added all of these
02:37:14.479 icons from Lucid React
02:37:16.439 here. And now we're going to go ahead
02:37:18.560 and render them so that they display
02:37:21.600 just like
02:37:23.240 this. Let's go ahead and back inside of
02:37:25.600 the layout. And actually, I can't really
02:37:28.640 import anything yet. I first have to
02:37:30.560 develop at least something. So, let's
02:37:32.240 export con dashboard
02:37:35.880 sidebar. And let's go ahead and return a
02:37:39.120 sidebar component. Then a sidebar
02:37:43.000 header and give the sidebar header a
02:37:45.840 class name. Next text sidebar
02:37:49.080 accent dash
02:37:51.560 forground. And inside of here a link
02:37:55.200 from next link. Make sure you don't
02:37:58.399 accidentally import it from Lucid React.
02:38:03.120 Give this link an href of a forward
02:38:06.479 slash and give it a class name of flex
02:38:09.560 items center gap 2 px2 and padding top
02:38:14.080 of two. Inside of the link render an
02:38:18.439 image from
02:38:20.920 next forward slash
02:38:23.479 image and give it an href of /lovg.
02:38:28.479 Basically the same thing that we do in
02:38:30.479 our sign up and sign in
02:38:33.560 views logo SVG. In here we used a normal
02:38:37.520 image element because we needed to
02:38:39.280 position it uh and style it a certain
02:38:42.160 way. But in here we can use the
02:38:44.080 optimized image component from
02:38:46.520 Nex.js. Now go ahead and give it a
02:38:48.840 height of 36 and a width of 36 and an al
02:38:55.120 of logo or meet AI whatever you
02:38:59.000 want and let me just see it's not href
02:39:02.000 it's a source okay and now we can
02:39:05.359 already import this in the layout so
02:39:07.200 let's add that so we have one less
02:39:09.800 error and you should already start
02:39:12.000 seeing the development here make sure
02:39:14.240 you're not zoomed in too much as it will
02:39:16.640 probably collapse apps on mobile. So,
02:39:18.399 make sure you are in the desktop
02:39:20.439 view. Great. So, we now have that. And
02:39:24.720 let's add a paragraph here. Meet AI or
02:39:28.800 the name of your app. And add a class
02:39:31.600 name here, text to Excel, and font
02:39:35.479 semibold. There we go. We have our text
02:39:38.080 here now.
02:39:39.479 Perfect. Now, let's go below this and
02:39:42.479 add a class name div with a class
02:39:45.640 namex4. and py of two and inside a
02:39:50.359 separator. There is a dash uh a sidebar
02:39:54.399 separator component as
02:39:57.000 well like this. But um I had some
02:40:01.840 problems with it. Maybe it's something
02:40:04.160 uh the way I'm using it. It always
02:40:07.319 overflow here for some reason. So that's
02:40:10.399 why I'm not using it in case you were
02:40:12.160 wondering. And let's go ahead and give
02:40:14.560 the text uh the separator a class name
02:40:17.200 opacity
02:40:21.080 10 and a text
02:40:24.600 of hex color
02:40:27.640 5D 6B
02:40:31.720 68. After you've done that, go ahead and
02:40:34.319 save. And I'm not even sure if you will
02:40:37.520 see this because it's extremely
02:40:39.840 extremely thin. And I can barely see it,
02:40:42.240 but you know, just for your sanity, you
02:40:44.399 can
02:40:45.880 add black. Can you do that text
02:40:50.200 black? Or maybe let's
02:40:52.920 see. Um I'm I'm trying to make sure this
02:40:56.399 is actually
02:41:01.080 visible. Uh let me just see. Opacity 10.
02:41:04.720 How about I add
02:41:06.120 opacity 100? There we go. Okay. So yeah,
02:41:09.520 it's definitely here. Bring it back to
02:41:12.960 what we've wrote here. U the reason I'm
02:41:15.600 doing it like this where it's barely
02:41:17.040 visible is because later we are going to
02:41:18.960 obviously inverse these colors. So this
02:41:21.280 is how it's going to be visible.
02:41:22.800 Obviously on a white background you can
02:41:25.120 barely see it but later when we inverse
02:41:27.200 the colors it will be it will have more
02:41:29.640 sense. Great. So now let's add a sidebar
02:41:34.080 content. sidebar group, sidebar group
02:41:39.319 content, and sidebar menu
02:41:43.000 here. Inside of here, map the first
02:41:46.319 section of our items. So, get the
02:41:50.000 individual item and go ahead and render
02:41:54.240 sidebar menu item here.
02:41:57.680 Go ahead and give it a key of item
02:42:01.800 href. And inside render a sidebar menu
02:42:07.000 button. And inside of here we are going
02:42:10.319 to add a link
02:42:13.319 component. Uh we already have it. Great.
02:42:16.000 And let's add an href here to be item
02:42:19.200 href.
02:42:21.760 And then what we can do is add a span
02:42:27.080 here item label and give this a class
02:42:31.200 name text small font medium and tracking
02:42:37.080 type. Let me just indent this. And now
02:42:40.640 you should see meetings and agents text
02:42:43.439 here. And when you click on them, they
02:42:45.680 should lead you to 404 because we don't
02:42:48.080 have them yet. But if you take a look at
02:42:50.160 your URLs, they should be correct. So
02:42:53.520 what's missing is to uh render the
02:42:56.800 actual icon here. So let's go ahead and
02:42:59.840 do the
02:43:01.560 following. Um what we can
02:43:05.560 do, let me try and do this. Can I just
02:43:10.040 use this item icon and render it like
02:43:14.040 this? I can. There we go. Like that.
02:43:16.720 Let's just go ahead and style it a bit
02:43:19.640 better. So, I'm going to give this a
02:43:22.000 class name of size five. Like
02:43:27.800 this. And this should just make it a
02:43:30.240 little bit smaller, but you can see it's
02:43:32.240 still kind of uh messed up. Not exactly
02:43:35.120 behaving as we wanted to. Uh, and what I
02:43:39.280 actually want to do now before we do
02:43:42.000 anything else, before we fix this, uh,
02:43:45.680 is I want to go ahead and actually apply
02:43:50.080 the proper theme for our dashboard here.
02:43:54.240 So, let's go ahead and go inside of our
02:43:59.000 source app folder, globals.css.
02:44:05.120 And what I want you to do is I want you
02:44:07.040 to scroll down and find the root. Now be
02:44:10.640 careful because they have identical
02:44:13.439 variables for root and for dark. We are
02:44:17.680 not modifying dark. We are just
02:44:19.760 modifying the root. Okay. So the first
02:44:22.960 one you're going to modify in your root
02:44:25.439 is the primary color. Now, what I like
02:44:27.920 to do is I like to leave comments so I
02:44:30.399 know what I modified and I also add a
02:44:33.120 little explanation of what it is. This
02:44:35.040 one is pretty self-explanatory, but
02:44:37.040 still primary color, for example, the
02:44:40.319 color of our buttons. So, instead of
02:44:45.640 0.20500, we're going to set it 0.63, the
02:44:49.279 second value will be
02:44:51.800 0.1699 and the third value 149.21.
02:44:56.240 Make sure that you don't add any commas
02:44:58.160 here. This is not RGB. Okay. And right
02:45:01.840 now, what you will immediately notice is
02:45:03.760 that our buttons have a new color. So,
02:45:06.880 yes, now our button has a new primary
02:45:09.760 color. Previously, it was a black color
02:45:11.840 and now our button is this nice green
02:45:14.640 color matching our app. So, that's the
02:45:17.120 first thing I want us to change. And
02:45:19.720 now, make sure you're logged in and
02:45:22.000 seeing the sidebar. I want you to find
02:45:24.560 these sidebar elements here and let's
02:45:28.160 modify the sidebar one. So I will mark
02:45:30.479 this as sidebar background color so I
02:45:33.120 know what it is and that I've modified
02:45:35.120 it. It will be 0.2. The second value
02:45:38.560 will be
02:45:39.479 0.0283 and the third one
02:45:43.479 174.92. And you can already see the
02:45:46.080 background color has now changed. Below
02:45:48.880 that we have sidebar foreground which
02:45:52.319 will be sidebar text
02:45:54.359 color. Go ahead and change this to be
02:45:57.960 0.82
02:46:00.279 0.57 and
02:46:03.399 182.99. So now the text is more visible
02:46:06.560 towards this dark
02:46:09.160 background. We are going to leave the
02:46:11.200 primary and the primary foreground as
02:46:13.520 they are and go to sidebar accent. This
02:46:16.800 is sidebar active item background
02:46:20.439 color. And go ahead and change this to
02:46:23.040 be
02:46:24.359 0.34
02:46:26.600 0.0601. And the last one
02:46:30.120 171.21. And the last one we're going to
02:46:32.399 modify is the sidebar accent foreground,
02:46:35.520 which is basically sidebar active item
02:46:38.960 text
02:46:40.680 color. Go ahead and modify this to
02:46:43.800 0.34 0.06. 06. Uh my apologies. No, I I
02:46:48.560 I was reading the values from here. Uh
02:46:52.240 the sidebar active text uh color will be
02:46:56.160 1 0 0. A very simple one. So now that we
02:47:00.479 finally have our colors set, what we can
02:47:03.200 do is we can go back inside of the
02:47:04.960 dashboard sidebar and we can modify the
02:47:07.279 sidebar menu button to have some nicer
02:47:09.760 colors here. So go ahead and add a class
02:47:12.560 name here and import CN from lib utils.
02:47:16.800 This will allow us to dynamically change
02:47:19.279 class names if needed and also avoid any
02:47:21.840 merge conflicts. So this is the util
02:47:25.279 that was added with shad CN. I think
02:47:27.200 this was one of the first uh functions
02:47:29.200 we looked at once we added chaten and I
02:47:31.439 told you it was going to come in handy
02:47:33.040 later on. So CN util is a way you should
02:47:37.439 uh merge your class names, right? So the
02:47:40.560 way you use it is pretty simple. It can
02:47:42.479 accept an infinite amount of parameters.
02:47:44.640 So the uh it can be for example text
02:47:48.479 rows 500 and then the second parameter
02:47:50.880 background blue 500 or you can add all
02:47:54.880 of them in one parameter depending on
02:47:56.800 what you need. Right? So here's how I
02:47:59.680 like to use it. Um I like to reserve the
02:48:02.960 first parameter for my default classes.
02:48:05.359 So for example height 10 on hover
02:48:09.200 background linear to right /
02:48:15.160 klch give it a border border
02:48:19.160 transparent on hover border will have a
02:48:24.600 5B
02:48:26.120 6B 68
02:48:29.399 color divide it by 10.
02:48:33.439 We are continuing our and this is a
02:48:36.080 typo. It's not linear. It's
02:48:38.359 linear. Make sure that when you hover on
02:48:40.720 your class names, you can actually see
02:48:42.240 the tailwind. I mean the CSS. That means
02:48:45.600 it's a correct variable. And again, make
02:48:48.080 sure you have the tailwind CSS
02:48:50.880 intellense installed. So you can see
02:48:52.880 that. Let's continue. So from sidebar
02:48:57.040 accent, which we have now modified,
02:48:58.960 right? From 5% like this.
02:49:04.399 via 30% via sidebar color, but let's
02:49:09.680 reduce it for 50% opacity to sidebar
02:49:13.760 color, but let's reduce it for 50%
02:49:16.479 opacity as well. So now when you hover,
02:49:19.040 we have this nice effect. As you can
02:49:21.520 see, it's brighter here and then it goes
02:49:24.240 dark here. So it's a very cool looking
02:49:26.800 effect when we hover on our sidebar
02:49:28.880 items here like that. And let's go ahead
02:49:32.399 and also do one important thing. So the
02:49:34.520 reason our sidebar menu button looks
02:49:37.200 broken is because we forgot to add as
02:49:39.200 child here. Once you add that, there we
02:49:41.920 go. You will see how it becomes a uh
02:49:44.640 properly aligned and it's entirely
02:49:46.560 clickable, right? You don't have to
02:49:48.720 click directly on the label. Perfect. So
02:49:51.760 that is now added. Now uh what I also
02:49:57.200 want to do is the following. I want to
02:50:00.319 know if a certain route is active for
02:50:03.080 example. So the way we can do that is by
02:50:07.160 adding a const path name use path name
02:50:11.920 from next
02:50:13.880 navigation. Make sure to add this import
02:50:17.240 here. And then we can simply compare the
02:50:20.800 path name with the item href. So for
02:50:24.240 example I just added this. Obviously, if
02:50:27.600 I were just to add this type of class, I
02:50:29.920 wouldn't need the CN util. But since now
02:50:32.640 I'm going to add a comma here and add a
02:50:35.040 dynamic one, it makes sense. So if path
02:50:38.040 name is identical to the item href for
02:50:41.600 this specific item that we are iterating
02:50:43.960 upon, we can simply add a different
02:50:46.880 color background
02:50:49.720 linear to write OK
02:50:54.920 L. and then a
02:50:59.000 border 5 D 6B 68 / 10 like this. And we
02:51:08.080 can try it out. For
02:51:09.720 example, you can do you can comment this
02:51:13.120 out and then just set consp
02:51:15.800 name to be slash meetings and then you
02:51:20.720 will see that the meetings will kind of
02:51:22.640 be active like this. But
02:51:24.600 um I don't want it
02:51:27.479 exactly to be like this. Oh yes, because
02:51:30.160 we are missing one more prop here. So
02:51:33.279 let's add is active
02:51:35.240 here. Path name identical to item href.
02:51:39.520 There we go. So this is how it will look
02:51:43.040 like when meetings is selected, right?
02:51:45.439 Or if the agents is selected. Did I
02:51:50.080 write this properly? the agents forward
02:51:52.560 slash
02:51:56.920 agents. I'm expecting the agents to be
02:52:00.319 selected, but looks like um they are not
02:52:03.600 selected for some
02:52:05.399 reason. Uh let me just pause a bit and
02:52:07.920 debug to see what I'm doing
02:52:11.080 wrong. Oh well, I figured out what I'm
02:52:14.160 doing wrong. Uh I'm using a path name to
02:52:17.920 be like identical string but it's not
02:52:20.560 identical. It's missing a it has an
02:52:22.560 extra space here. So that's not the same
02:52:24.720 string. Yeah, there we go. Now it's
02:52:26.399 working. So that was the mistake. Great.
02:52:29.359 We can now remove the hard-coded path
02:52:31.680 name and make it dynamic like this. So
02:52:34.720 naturally none of these two will be
02:52:36.960 selected because we are on the root
02:52:38.640 page. And if you're wondering where is
02:52:40.640 the root page in the sidebar, we are not
02:52:42.399 going to have the root page. We are
02:52:43.920 later going to add a rewrite in the
02:52:46.080 nextjs config to always lead us to slash
02:52:50.240 slashmeings as the default page but we
02:52:53.040 don't need that now we are okay with
02:52:55.120 having this kind of root page for now uh
02:52:58.399 great so we have
02:53:00.920 this now what I want to do is I want to
02:53:03.920 add the second section and we can do
02:53:07.200 this quite easily here so what we need
02:53:09.840 is we need to copy the entire sidebar
02:53:12.680 group actually I think um let me just
02:53:15.840 see do we
02:53:17.080 copy the
02:53:19.640 entire yeah let's just copy the entire
02:53:22.640 sidebar group like this and let's paste
02:53:25.600 it below and let's just add second
02:53:30.399 section here. So a bit repetitive but
02:53:32.800 there we go. Now we have an upgrade
02:53:34.560 which is clearly separated here and in
02:53:37.600 between these two groups what we can do
02:53:39.600 is we can copy this
02:53:42.399 And we can add it
02:53:44.760 here. And there we go. Now we have this
02:53:47.600 kind of separator here as well. Um,
02:53:50.399 great. So that is now uh
02:53:54.040 semifinished. What I also want to do to
02:53:56.720 wrap up the chapter is implement the
02:54:00.160 user button. So the currently logged in
02:54:02.479 user. Right? So the way we are going to
02:54:05.439 do that is by going to the end of the
02:54:08.080 sidebar content and adding the sidebar
02:54:11.479 footer. Let's go ahead and give this a
02:54:13.760 class name of text
02:54:16.279 white. And let's go ahead and add a div
02:54:22.200 here with a class
02:54:25.319 name. Uh actually I don't think we need
02:54:29.520 this. We can just do normal user button
02:54:33.359 like this. So this is a component which
02:54:35.600 we're going to have to implement
02:54:38.200 now. Uh and actually we might call it
02:54:41.319 dashboard user button like this. So we
02:54:46.160 can go inside of a modules components
02:54:47.840 and create dashboard user
02:54:51.560 button.tsx because it's not exactly
02:54:53.439 going to be reusable anywhere other than
02:54:55.200 the dashboard. So in here what we're
02:54:58.240 going to do is we're going
02:55:00.600 to export const dashboard user
02:55:05.640 button return
02:55:09.479 div user
02:55:12.040 button and import dashboard user button
02:55:15.880 here from dot / user button is
02:55:18.560 completely fine because they are in the
02:55:19.920 same folder. So now here at the bottom
02:55:22.479 you should have user
02:55:24.520 button. In case this nextjs action
02:55:27.680 button is getting in the way, you can
02:55:29.760 actually click on it. You can click on
02:55:32.640 preferences here and you can change the
02:55:35.040 position for example to be bottom right
02:55:37.760 which will move it here which is okay
02:55:39.680 because we won't really have anything uh
02:55:41.760 here. So if you want to you can do that.
02:55:43.840 So you can clearly see the user button
02:55:45.520 here. Now let's go ahead and focus on
02:55:48.319 the dashboard user button and let's go
02:55:50.800 ahead and develop it. So what we have to
02:55:53.600 do inside of the dashboard user button
02:55:55.600 is get the data and is pending from out
02:56:00.840 client use session. Make sure you import
02:56:04.439 this. So if is pending or if there is no
02:56:10.279 data user we can just return
02:56:14.680 null like this. So for a split second
02:56:18.640 this will not be visible as you can see.
02:56:22.640 If you want to you can add a loading
02:56:24.640 indicator here however you prefer but
02:56:26.960 I'm completely okay for a split second
02:56:28.880 this just not existing until it loads.
02:56:30.640 I've seen that kind of behavior on a lot
02:56:32.560 of websites. So now let's go ahead and
02:56:36.319 do the following. We have to import
02:56:38.960 everything from drop-down menu. So let's
02:56:42.720 add all of these things. Drop-own menu
02:56:44.960 content item label separator and the
02:56:47.920 trigger from components UI drop-down
02:56:52.279 menu. So I'm going to encapsulate this
02:56:54.880 inside of the drop-down menu here. I
02:56:57.520 will add a drop-own menu trigger
02:56:59.520 component here. And I will give it a
02:57:01.840 class name rounded large border border
02:57:05.920 dash border with 10% opacity padding
02:57:09.600 three full width flex items center
02:57:15.279 justify between background white with 5%
02:57:19.760 opacity on hover background white with
02:57:23.040 10% opacity and overflow
02:57:25.880 hidden. And inside of here, what we are
02:57:28.560 going to do is the following. Let's just
02:57:31.439 leave the user button now and you will
02:57:33.200 see how it looks like. Right? You can
02:57:34.880 zoom in a little bit, but just make sure
02:57:37.120 your sidebar doesn't collapse if it's
02:57:39.200 hard for you to see. There we go. So now
02:57:42.319 what I want to do is I want to display
02:57:44.080 this user's image. So you can search for
02:57:47.359 data
02:57:48.439 user.image. And if we have an image, you
02:57:51.680 will display an avatar. If we don't, you
02:57:54.720 can just display null. We will actually
02:57:57.520 render something later. So for now,
02:58:00.000 let's go ahead and leave it like this
02:58:01.439 and add an avatar from components UI
02:58:03.840 avatar and add avatar image from
02:58:07.279 components UI
02:58:09.800 avatar. You can move this here as well.
02:58:12.960 You also have this installed when you
02:58:14.800 added chats UI. And the image will be
02:58:17.920 source data user image like this.
02:58:22.880 So since I've logged in with my uh
02:58:25.760 GitHub, you can see that I have an image
02:58:28.240 here. If you logged in using
02:58:29.960 credentials, you will most likely not
02:58:32.399 have an image here. So that's completely
02:58:33.920 normal. Don't worry. What I want us to
02:58:36.399 do now is implement a little component
02:58:39.200 which will be useful for us uh to create
02:58:43.840 uh placeholder images. It will be useful
02:58:46.800 for two reasons. for users who don't
02:58:48.640 have an avatar and second for our
02:58:52.040 agents, right? Our agents will be given
02:58:54.640 some kind of personality with a
02:58:56.319 generated avatar. So, let's go
02:58:59.720 ahead and go inside of components and
02:59:02.880 create a new f a new file called
02:59:06.439 generated-vatar.tsx. So, you don't have
02:59:08.080 to put this in the UI folder. I like to
02:59:10.640 keep chats and only stuff inside of
02:59:12.640 here. instead of the generated avatar
02:59:15.840 here, uh, we're going to have to install
02:59:18.800 two
02:59:20.120 packages. So, the first one will be at
02:59:24.160 dicebar-core
02:59:26.640 u, my apologies, forward slashcore, and
02:59:28.800 the second one will be at dice
02:59:32.200 bear. So, it's dice bear, not bar
02:59:36.439 slashcolction. Make sure to correct the
02:59:38.960 dice bear if you haven't. And I'm pretty
02:59:40.800 sure we need to add dash legacy pier
02:59:44.479 depths to avoid any errors. I will of
02:59:46.720 course show you the exact versions that
02:59:48.319 have been added to my package JSON
02:59:50.840 here. So let's go inside of package JSON
02:59:54.479 and let's go inside of there we go dice
02:59:58.399 pair. So 922 922 like
03:00:02.200 this. So now we can go back inside of
03:00:05.200 our generated avatar here and we can
03:00:07.840 import Oops. create avatar from dice
03:00:11.279 bear core and we are going to import two
03:00:14.000 collections from dice bear collection.
03:00:16.319 The first one will be bots neutral and
03:00:18.560 the second one will be initial initials.
03:00:21.359 So basically dice bear is an amazing
03:00:23.840 library uh which can you can either use
03:00:27.040 it with their JS API, their react API,
03:00:30.720 they have a bunch of solutions. They
03:00:32.880 even have an HTTP uh rest API, right?
03:00:36.240 But this one is um this one is cool
03:00:39.200 because it actually generates the SVG
03:00:41.600 without needing an internet connection.
03:00:43.359 So it's not going to generate any fetch
03:00:45.040 requests in our network to display these
03:00:47.279 avatars. And there's a bunch of
03:00:49.359 collections you can explore. You can see
03:00:51.760 there's a ton of them. Uh the ones I've
03:00:54.240 chosen here have a license which is free
03:00:57.680 for personal and commercial use. So
03:01:00.560 those are the initials and bots neutral
03:01:03.040 created by Pablo Stanley. So amazing
03:01:05.439 amazing libraries.
03:01:08.240 So after you've added this, let's go
03:01:10.319 ahead and import CN from lib utils and
03:01:14.160 let's import
03:01:15.800 avatar avatar fallback and avatar
03:01:20.279 image from add /components UI
03:01:25.479 avatar and in here create an interface
03:01:28.640 generated avatar
03:01:31.479 props seed will be a string class name
03:01:35.439 will be an optional string.
03:01:37.600 And the variant will either be uh well
03:01:41.200 you can just copy bots neutral or
03:01:45.120 initials like
03:01:47.160 this and then export con generated
03:01:50.640 avatar
03:01:54.439 here. Go ahead and dstructure the props
03:01:57.960 here. So that will be seed class name
03:02:01.120 and
03:02:02.520 variant just like that. and then define
03:02:05.840 the avatar here. So let avatar if
03:02:12.439 variant is equal to bots neutral avatar
03:02:17.040 will become create
03:02:19.319 avatar bots neutral and simply pass in
03:02:23.680 the seed.
03:02:27.240 Else
03:02:28.840 avatar will be create
03:02:32.279 avatar
03:02:34.600 initials. Pass in the seed, pass in the
03:02:37.920 font
03:02:39.960 weight and pass in font
03:02:43.000 size like this.
03:02:47.439 Now that you have the avatar, what you
03:02:50.319 can do is you can
03:02:52.359 return
03:02:54.040 avatar avatar
03:02:56.600 image and avatar fallback
03:02:59.800 here. Give the image a source of avatar
03:03:03.600 to data uri and an out of avatar.
03:03:07.760 And for the
03:03:10.120 fallback we can just use seed dot
03:03:14.160 character at first one to
03:03:18.520 uppercase and give the avatar a class
03:03:21.200 name of CN and pass in the class name
03:03:23.279 inside so we can modify it from the
03:03:26.040 outside. So now we have a component we
03:03:28.560 can use whenever we need a generated
03:03:30.960 avatar. So let's go back to our
03:03:34.000 dashboard user button here and what the
03:03:38.399 alternative here will be instead of null
03:03:41.120 is the generated avatar
03:03:43.399 component and pass in the seed to be
03:03:46.399 data
03:03:47.479 username and the variant will be
03:03:51.560 initials and class name will be size 9
03:03:55.439 and mr of
03:03:57.000 three initials like this.
03:04:01.520 So now nothing really changes for me.
03:04:03.520 But if I for example sign
03:04:06.520 out and if I go ahead and create a new
03:04:09.359 user for example
03:04:11.520 uh so mark
03:04:16.840 markdemo.com and sign in. So this one
03:04:19.439 does not have uh you can see any image
03:04:22.800 we use the generated avatar with their
03:04:25.680 initials here. So that's how this will
03:04:28.479 be used or you can change it to boss
03:04:35.720 neutral and then it will create a little
03:04:38.160 bot right but that makes more sense to
03:04:40.560 use for the actual agents right great so
03:04:44.479 that's one thing that I wanted for the
03:04:46.960 trigger uh but still let's go still
03:04:49.760 inside of the drop-down trigger here and
03:04:52.160 create a div with a class name flex flex
03:04:55.840 column gap
03:04:57.479 app.5 text left overflow hidden flex one
03:05:02.560 and a minimum width of zero. Inside
03:05:06.160 we're going to have data
03:05:08.520 username and we're going to have data
03:05:11.520 user email rendered here. So give the
03:05:15.520 first one a class name of text small
03:05:17.760 truncate and w with
03:05:20.760 full and the bottom one a class name of
03:05:24.640 text extra small truncate and with full.
03:05:29.520 And there we go. Now you have your name
03:05:31.439 and your email right
03:05:33.560 here. Outside of the trigger we're going
03:05:36.319 to have a drop-own menu content here.
03:05:40.000 This will have an align of end side of
03:05:44.080 right and class name of width
03:05:47.720 72. And inside of here drop-down menu
03:05:52.200 label with a
03:05:54.279 div class name flex flex column and gap
03:05:59.520 of one. And then inside of
03:06:02.680 here you're going to have two span
03:06:05.120 elements. The first one will be data do
03:06:07.520 user.name.
03:06:09.240 name with a class name font medium and
03:06:13.960 truncate and the bottom one will be data
03:06:17.920 user email again with the class name
03:06:21.760 text small font normal text muted
03:06:26.160 foreground and truncate. So now when you
03:06:29.359 click here you can see how it will open
03:06:31.520 additional options here in form of a
03:06:34.600 dropdown. Great. Uh, and one thing I
03:06:37.920 forgot to do here in the drop-down menu
03:06:40.800 trigger before you close it, just go
03:06:43.600 ahead and add a chevron down icon from
03:06:46.960 Lucid React. Give it a class name size
03:06:50.960 four and shrink zero. Make sure you've
03:06:53.920 added the Lucid icon
03:06:57.800 import. There we go. So, now it has a
03:07:00.080 drop-own
03:07:01.479 button. Perfect. So now let's go ahead
03:07:04.960 and continue developing uh the drop-own
03:07:07.120 menu content here. So after we finish
03:07:10.160 with our label, add a drop-own menu
03:07:14.040 separator, a self-closing tag, and then
03:07:16.640 a drop-own menu
03:07:18.840 item in here. Add
03:07:21.960 billing and credit card icon from Lucid
03:07:27.080 React. Copy this. And this one will be
03:07:30.960 log out icon with the text log
03:07:34.680 out. Give both of these icons class
03:07:37.439 names and size
03:07:39.479 four like this. And you can give both of
03:07:42.800 this drop-own menu
03:07:45.640 items class
03:07:47.800 names cursor pointer flex items center
03:07:52.560 and justify
03:07:55.880 between. There we go. So this is how the
03:07:58.399 buttons are
03:07:59.640 looking and we can't really develop the
03:08:02.800 billing one but we can develop the on
03:08:06.240 logout one. So above the return here add
03:08:10.800 const on logout asynchronous method
03:08:14.640 await out client sign
03:08:17.880 out fetch options on
03:08:24.520 success. And we also have to add the
03:08:27.520 router here
03:08:29.319 from use router next
03:08:34.760 navigation like this.
03:08:37.760 And let's do router push forward slash
03:08:42.160 sign in. And we this actually does not
03:08:44.960 have to be asynchronous. We don't have
03:08:46.479 to wait it at all. Let's use on log out.
03:08:49.840 And let's add it to the on click
03:08:54.120 here. There we go. So now we have a user
03:08:56.720 button which you can see takes some time
03:08:58.479 to load. Once it loads, we can click log
03:09:00.560 out and we are logged out. Perfect. So
03:09:04.960 what I want to do now is I want to wrap
03:09:07.600 it up by fixing the gradient colors here
03:09:09.680 because we have added the layout, the
03:09:11.359 modules, the sidebar, and we modified
03:09:13.279 the globals theme. And now let's use
03:09:15.680 these new variables to fix the gradient
03:09:17.840 colors in the ALF views. So this part
03:09:20.560 right here. So go inside of this sign in
03:09:23.640 view in your modules al UI views and
03:09:29.840 find the second column where you render
03:09:32.399 the normal image tag with logo SVG where
03:09:36.399 you have the background uh
03:09:38.680 radial and instead of using these colors
03:09:41.760 we're going to add our new variable
03:09:43.760 colors. So from sidebar
03:09:47.479 accent to
03:09:50.680 sidebar. There we go. So now it matches
03:09:53.359 our sidebar. Uh technically, you know,
03:09:57.520 we are using the sidebar color variable
03:10:01.359 for something that's not a sidebar, but
03:10:03.200 they think it's okay to borrow it for,
03:10:05.200 you know, just one or two more places,
03:10:07.439 right? Let's go ahead and copy this and
03:10:09.840 do the same thing in the sign up view so
03:10:11.680 that they look the same.
03:10:14.640 There we go. So now both our sign up and
03:10:18.560 our signin forms look very nice. Great.
03:10:22.800 So I'm going to go ahead and
03:10:25.560 uh wrap up the chapter now because we
03:10:28.399 just fixed this. There we go. And now
03:10:30.640 let's create review and merge our pull
03:10:34.040 request. So what I'm going to do is
03:10:36.960 close everything, open my source graph
03:10:39.479 here. You can see we have a lot of
03:10:41.600 changes here. Let's click on the branch
03:10:43.680 down here. Let's click create new branch
03:10:46.560 and let's call this
03:10:48.200 06 or is it 05? I'm not sure. 06
03:10:52.399 dashboard
03:10:57.080 sidebar. Let's add all
03:10:59.880 changes so they are staged. And let's do
03:11:04.080 uh 06 dashboard
03:11:07.080 sidebar. Make sure you are in your new
03:11:09.439 branch here. Click commit and publish
03:11:12.840 branch. There we go. Now let's go
03:11:16.680 to
03:11:19.240 GitHub. Let's open a pull
03:11:22.279 request and let's wait for our reviewer
03:11:25.600 to finish looking at our
03:11:30.359 code. And here we have our code summary.
03:11:33.840 So new features. We introduced a
03:11:35.920 dashboard layout with a sidebar
03:11:37.439 navigation and main content area. We
03:11:39.920 have added a sidebar component featuring
03:11:41.760 navigation links, section grouping, and
03:11:43.760 active route highlighting. We've
03:11:45.840 implemented the user profile button in
03:11:47.680 the sidebar with drop-own menu for
03:11:49.520 options for billing and logout as well
03:11:52.240 as the aer generator component. So in
03:11:55.680 here we have a file by file walk through
03:11:59.200 and a deeper uh review of what we've
03:12:02.160 done. Two sequence diagrams. The first
03:12:04.720 one explaining how our dashboard uh
03:12:07.359 layout actually works and the second one
03:12:10.160 is our dashboard user button which
03:12:12.319 handles the sign out functionality. We
03:12:15.600 have some actionable comments. The first
03:12:17.359 one is to add an on error in case sign
03:12:20.960 out fails. This is definitely something
03:12:23.200 we can do and we will come back to this
03:12:26.560 when we add the actual toaster component
03:12:29.120 for displaying errors. Right? So very
03:12:32.000 good suggestion here in here. Obviously
03:12:34.720 they suggest reusing some of the styles
03:12:36.800 because we have two identical uh section
03:12:40.240 groups, you know, first section and
03:12:41.840 second section inside inside of our
03:12:43.760 dashboard sidebar. But since we know
03:12:45.600 it's only going to be used for two
03:12:47.040 things, I'm okay with reusing it. If it
03:12:49.279 turns out that we will add more sections
03:12:51.040 in the future, it will probably be a
03:12:53.040 good idea to separate it like they
03:12:55.040 suggested
03:12:56.200 here. In here, it advises against using
03:12:59.920 hardcoded colors like this, which is a
03:13:02.000 completely valid claim. So, we can
03:13:03.680 consider adding this to our uh global
03:13:07.399 CSS. We'll see if we can find at least
03:13:10.080 one more place to use it perhaps. But uh
03:13:12.880 for this one of cases, I'm okay with
03:13:14.960 hard coding it. Uh anyways, great great
03:13:18.080 suggestions here. You can of course
03:13:19.520 decide for yourself. You know, your your
03:13:21.520 project does not have to be identical to
03:13:23.279 mine. if you want to handle some things
03:13:25.359 that AI suggests, feel free to do so.
03:13:28.239 So, I'm going to go ahead and merge this
03:13:30.080 pull request. And once I've done that,
03:13:32.000 I'm going back inside of my IDE here.
03:13:35.279 And I'm clicking down here and going
03:13:37.200 back to my main branch. Make sure this
03:13:39.600 says main or whatever is the name of
03:13:41.359 your default branch and click on
03:13:43.600 synchronize changes and click okay. And
03:13:46.800 this should automatically synchronize
03:13:49.760 everything here. So you can check by
03:13:52.080 going inside of the app. There we go.
03:13:54.640 Layout, dashboard, sidebar, everything
03:13:57.359 is here. Amazing. So that wraps up this
03:14:00.640 chapter. Amazing job. And see you in the
03:14:03.040 next
03:14:04.680 one. In this chapter, we're going to go
03:14:07.279 ahead and develop the dashboard navbar,
03:14:10.239 which should together with the dashboard
03:14:12.600 sidebar wrap up the dashboard layout. So
03:14:16.560 in the previous chapter, we have
03:14:18.160 developed this part right here. And now
03:14:20.560 we're going to focus on this. So two
03:14:23.840 things will happen in the navbar. First,
03:14:26.080 we're going to have the collapse button
03:14:28.560 so that we can collapse the sidebar if
03:14:30.720 needed. And the second one will while it
03:14:33.920 looks like an input, it's actually going
03:14:36.000 to be a button which is going to open a
03:14:38.560 command model so that we will be able to
03:14:41.520 search for any agent or any meeting
03:14:45.520 using a global search. and we will also
03:14:48.399 have a little shortcut to open it. So
03:14:52.239 let's start by creating the dashboard
03:14:54.920 navbar. As always, make sure you have
03:14:57.760 your app running and let's go ahead and
03:15:00.560 do the following. Let's go inside of
03:15:02.239 source app dashboard layout. And before
03:15:05.680 you write anything, double check you are
03:15:08.080 on your main branch here. And now inside
03:15:11.680 of
03:15:12.439 main uh inside of the main element I'm
03:15:15.359 going to add dashboard navbar component.
03:15:18.239 Now let's go inside of the modules
03:15:21.120 dashboard components. And now inside add
03:15:26.120 dashboard
03:15:29.319 navbar.tsx like this. So let's go ahead
03:15:32.319 and mark this as use
03:15:35.319 client and let's export const dashboard
03:15:40.920 navbar instead of a div. Let's return a
03:15:44.319 nav element here and say hello
03:15:47.960 navbar. Let's go back to the layout and
03:15:50.720 let's import the dashboard navbar from
03:15:55.560 modules. And now when you go here, when
03:15:58.880 you
03:15:59.960 refresh above this page, you should see
03:16:03.439 hello navbar right here. So now we're
03:16:06.720 going to continue developing that. I'm
03:16:09.279 going to give this nav element a class
03:16:11.359 name flex px of 4, gap x of 2, items
03:16:17.399 center,
03:16:19.080 py3, border bottom, and bg of
03:16:23.720 background. There we go. So already
03:16:26.239 looks much better and I just can't help
03:16:29.040 but notice that we are missing a little
03:16:31.439 gap here in the user button between the
03:16:34.160 avatar and the info. So let's quickly go
03:16:36.720 inside of dashboard user button here and
03:16:41.200 let's find that. So in here we
03:16:44.600 have drop-down menu trigger here and
03:16:47.520 looks like we are missing the gap here.
03:16:49.279 So let's just add gap
03:16:51.479 x2 and there we go. that keeps it
03:16:54.160 separated like that. So, let's continue
03:16:56.960 going back inside of the D uh nav
03:17:00.479 dashboard navbar here and let's add a
03:17:02.880 nate uh a button component from
03:17:05.359 components UI button. And in here, I'm
03:17:08.479 going to render a panel left icon from
03:17:11.840 Lucid React. And I'm going to give this
03:17:14.880 a class name of size
03:17:16.760 9 and a variant of
03:17:20.439 outline like this.
03:17:23.359 So now I have this button here. Right
03:17:26.000 now when I click on it, it doesn't do
03:17:28.359 much. But what I can do since I've
03:17:31.520 wrapped my entire dashboard inside of a
03:17:34.319 sidebar provider, I can now
03:17:38.600 access use sidebar in any of its
03:17:42.160 children from components UI sidebar. And
03:17:44.880 in here I can get the current state of
03:17:46.720 the sidebar. I can get to toggle it and
03:17:49.760 I can also extract is
03:17:51.880 mobile. So what I'm going to do is the
03:17:54.239 following. I'm going to add on click
03:17:56.560 here to be toggle
03:17:58.920 sidebar. So now when a user clicks it
03:18:02.000 opens and
03:18:03.800 closes. And now what I'm going to do is
03:18:06.080 dynamically render this. So let's just
03:18:09.040 encapsulate this. And let's
03:18:12.120 check in parenthesis if state is
03:18:15.800 collapsed or if is mobile which means
03:18:19.920 it's automatically collapsed. We are
03:18:23.120 rendering the panel left icon otherwise
03:18:26.800 render panel left close icon from lucid
03:18:32.120 react. Now let me just collapse these so
03:18:35.279 they are easier to look
03:18:38.760 at. And now let's go ahead and just add
03:18:41.840 a little class name here size four
03:18:45.640 inside. So now you can see that we have
03:18:48.680 actual different icons representing
03:18:52.319 different actions, right? But if you
03:18:54.239 enter mobile, you will see how it will
03:18:58.120 behave exactly the same. Perfect.
03:19:01.920 So now that we've uh established that,
03:19:05.040 let's go ahead and handle the button
03:19:07.840 next to it, which is the search
03:19:11.560 button. So in here, I'm going to give
03:19:14.720 this button a variant of outline, a size
03:19:19.600 of
03:19:20.520 small, and on click for now, just an
03:19:23.359 empty arrow function. And in here I'm
03:19:26.560 going to add a class name height 9 width
03:19:29.760 of 240 pixels justify start font normal
03:19:36.640 text muted foreground hover text muted
03:19:40.319 foreground. Basically I'm doing this to
03:19:42.399 override uh the usual effect where the
03:19:46.080 color of the text changes on hover.
03:19:47.920 That's why I'm writing the same color on
03:19:49.880 hover. And uh that will be
03:19:52.920 it. And inside of here, I'm going to add
03:19:55.680 a search
03:19:57.000 icon from Lucid React. And you can
03:20:01.200 already see how this looks like. So,
03:20:02.720 it's very clearly a button. We're just
03:20:05.040 going to mask it as an input. There we
03:20:09.359 go. Like this. And what I want to do
03:20:11.680 here is add a KBD
03:20:14.200 element which will basically just be uh
03:20:18.319 a shortcut
03:20:21.319 representation because besides clicking
03:20:23.760 on this button you will also be able to
03:20:25.520 do a keyboard shortcut to open the
03:20:27.359 global search. So inside of here, add a
03:20:30.800 span element and go ahead and write the
03:20:34.279 following and
03:20:36.600 hashtag
03:20:38.200 8984 and then a column like this. And
03:20:42.239 this will render a command icon, right?
03:20:46.399 So obviously depending on uh Windows or
03:20:49.680 Mac, this will be the control icon. Uh
03:20:53.359 but it's basically the meta key, right?
03:20:56.560 You can of course change it if you want
03:20:58.560 to detect users operating system and
03:21:00.880 then display control, but most people
03:21:04.319 understand what this means. So now let's
03:21:06.800 go ahead and style this just a bit
03:21:10.160 better. So first of all, I want to give
03:21:12.239 this span a class name of text extra
03:21:14.880 small. And I'm going to give this one a
03:21:16.800 class name ML auto. So that will push it
03:21:20.080 to the end here. Pointer events none
03:21:25.520 inline flex height five select none
03:21:29.640 items center gap one rounded
03:21:35.319 border border uh my apologies background
03:21:39.880 muted px
03:21:43.000 1.5 font mono text 10
03:21:47.800 pixels font medium text muted foreground
03:21:52.319 and opacity. Um, no, actually we don't
03:21:55.760 have to do anything with the opacity.
03:21:57.840 There we go. So, now you can see that
03:21:59.600 this looks like an actual keyboard uh
03:22:02.560 shortcut. It's very recognizable, right?
03:22:05.960 Perfect. Uh, what I want to do before we
03:22:09.200 move forward is one thing just check one
03:22:12.080 thing. So, if you go inside of source
03:22:13.840 app layout, you can see that we are
03:22:16.080 currently using the Ge uh font. How
03:22:18.720 about we change this to instead use
03:22:21.560 enter? And let's go ahead and call this
03:22:25.160 enter and simply set the enter font. We
03:22:29.920 don't need the variable. So you can just
03:22:32.239 add enter like
03:22:34.279 this. And you can just add inter dot
03:22:39.040 class name
03:22:41.560 here like that. So this should change
03:22:44.960 the font of the app to be inter which I
03:22:47.840 think suits better in this
03:22:50.279 case. Now we can go back inside of the
03:22:53.120 dashboard navbar here. And what I want
03:22:56.640 to do now is I want to uh simply create
03:23:00.720 that command even though it's not going
03:23:03.359 to do much because we don't have
03:23:04.800 anything in the database to search for
03:23:06.640 and we don't have any API created but
03:23:09.439 let's just prepare for it. Right? So
03:23:11.279 wrap the entire thing inside of a
03:23:13.279 fragment here because semantically
03:23:16.560 uh it will not be inside of the navbar.
03:23:18.640 It will be here. So dashboard command
03:23:21.439 that's the component we're going to
03:23:23.080 create and go inside of here and create
03:23:26.279 dashboard command dsx. So all of them
03:23:30.160 live here together. Let's export the
03:23:33.359 dashboard command here. And inside of
03:23:36.800 here, what you're going to do is you
03:23:39.040 will return command dialogue from
03:23:41.600 components UI command. And then inside
03:23:44.720 of here, add the command input from
03:23:47.920 components UI
03:23:50.439 command. And now what we have to do is
03:23:53.120 we have to create the props for this. So
03:23:57.279 let's create an interface props open
03:24:02.840 boolean set open dispatch from react set
03:24:07.760 state action from react and then boolean
03:24:12.760 inside. Now let's go ahead and modify
03:24:15.200 this and let's destructure open and set
03:24:18.560 open here.
03:24:20.560 Let's pass in the open and on open
03:24:23.920 change set open like this. And besides
03:24:28.399 the let's actually add some attributes.
03:24:30.560 So the command input placeholder will be
03:24:33.760 find a meeting or agent like
03:24:37.479 this. And below this let's add a command
03:24:41.120 list from components UI command. And
03:24:44.479 then let's add command item from
03:24:46.640 components UI command. And in here I
03:24:49.200 will simply write test and I will give
03:24:51.920 this uh I'm not sure it needs uh
03:24:54.160 anything. We can just do test like this.
03:24:57.359 And let's leave it like this. So now
03:25:00.960 let's go inside of the dashboard navbar
03:25:02.720 and let's import this from dot /
03:25:05.279 dashboard command like that. And what we
03:25:08.160 have to do now is we have to implement
03:25:10.319 the use state control for this. So,
03:25:12.720 command open set command open use state
03:25:16.800 from react and set it to false by
03:25:20.080 default. And let's just move this up
03:25:22.200 here. And let's go ahead and add this to
03:25:25.200 be open. Command open and set open to be
03:25:29.439 set command
03:25:31.479 open. And now let's go ahead and use the
03:25:34.880 button for search to be set command
03:25:37.680 open. And let's simply toggle. So the
03:25:40.239 current value and just the reverse of
03:25:42.160 the current value. So now when you click
03:25:44.640 this, you can see that it opens up,
03:25:46.960 right? And you can see how it uses this
03:25:49.200 filtering search. It doesn't work
03:25:50.800 properly yet because we don't have an
03:25:52.880 actual API to call and search for
03:25:54.640 meetings or agents, right? But that's
03:25:56.640 how our global search will work. And one
03:25:58.720 thing we have to do is just implement
03:26:01.319 the shortcut here. So the way we can do
03:26:04.880 that is by using a use effect. Let's add
03:26:08.000 a use effect here from
03:26:13.560 React. Make sure you have imported this.
03:26:16.720 Uh you don't have to put anything in the
03:26:18.800 dependency array. Define a function
03:26:21.279 called down which will accept a keyboard
03:26:25.960 event. If event key is equal a and if we
03:26:32.239 are pressing a meta
03:26:35.000 key or we are pressing the control key
03:26:39.279 so compatible both on Windows and Unix
03:26:43.399 systems we will prevent default and
03:26:46.439 simply
03:26:48.359 toggle the current command
03:26:52.600 status and then let's add a document add
03:26:55.760 event listener.
03:26:57.120 key down to call the function down and
03:27:00.319 important on unmount we need to remove
03:27:03.840 that event listener on key down and pass
03:27:07.600 the reference to the function so now
03:27:10.160 when you press command and letter K it
03:27:13.760 should open let's see did I implement
03:27:15.920 this correctly I had to refresh there we
03:27:18.080 go so without clicking I can now open
03:27:20.640 and close it perfect so we just added
03:27:24.880 the dashboard navbar. And now let's wrap
03:27:27.520 it up by adding a responsive drawer to
03:27:29.680 dashboard user button. So basically
03:27:31.680 right now if you go into mobile
03:27:33.800 mode and open
03:27:36.920 this and click here, you can see that
03:27:39.680 it's not exactly usable, right? You
03:27:42.479 can't really use mobile like this. So
03:27:45.520 what we're going to do uh is we're going
03:27:47.920 to implement a drawer. We already have
03:27:50.160 that inside of our components. So what
03:27:52.640 we can do is go back to our dashboard
03:27:54.479 user button. The reason I'm doing this
03:27:56.960 is so that we start getting familiar
03:27:59.840 with uh our way of adding responsivity
03:28:03.200 here. So what we need to do is we have
03:28:04.880 to import all components from drawer the
03:28:08.960 same way we added all components from
03:28:10.760 drop-down. So from components UI drawer
03:28:13.760 which is a chat UI component. So source
03:28:16.160 components UI drawer right here. Drawer,
03:28:19.520 content, description, footer, header,
03:28:22.000 title, and trigger. And it works very
03:28:24.880 very similarly. Uh they pretty much
03:28:27.040 share the same base, same platform. So
03:28:30.640 what we're going to do is the following.
03:28:32.399 We're going to get const is mobile using
03:28:35.760 use is a mobile, which we also
03:28:38.760 have. If you're wondering where did this
03:28:41.120 come from, well also chatnui, one of the
03:28:44.560 components needs it. Uh in case you are
03:28:47.680 using, you know, some different version
03:28:49.680 and you don't have it, you can pause the
03:28:52.080 screen and just write the hook yourself.
03:28:54.319 It is pretty simple. It's not really
03:28:56.000 that complicated. Uh but there is
03:28:59.520 probably Oh, maybe it doesn't use it.
03:29:01.760 Oh, use is mobile. There we go. The
03:29:04.479 sidebar component uses it, right? So
03:29:06.479 that's why we have it in our project in
03:29:08.800 case you were wondering. So now we're
03:29:10.720 going to use it in the dashboard user
03:29:12.399 button. And what we're going to do is
03:29:14.000 the following. After this we're going to
03:29:16.239 do if is mobile we're going to do an
03:29:20.000 early return and similarly to this we
03:29:23.200 will open a drawer here and then a
03:29:26.160 drawer
03:29:27.880 trigger which will have an as child
03:29:31.160 option and in here what we can do
03:29:34.160 actually I think we can just copy this
03:29:36.880 thing like
03:29:38.760 that and then literally just copy what's
03:29:42.239 inside of this drop-own menu trigger.
03:29:45.840 So, all the way to
03:29:48.200 here and add it here. This will ensure
03:29:51.200 that the trigger button looks the same
03:29:54.800 on mobile.
03:29:56.880 But that's just the trigger because now
03:29:59.760 what we have to do is we have to add
03:30:01.920 drawer
03:30:03.399 content and in here a drawer header and
03:30:07.680 a drawer title with data user name and
03:30:12.880 in here data user email. This will be
03:30:16.439 drawer description and make sure to
03:30:19.040 change the closing tag as well.
03:30:22.319 Outside of the drawer header, open up
03:30:24.479 the drawer
03:30:25.960 footer. And in here, we are simply going
03:30:28.800 to add the two
03:30:31.319 buttons. So, let's add a button from
03:30:34.000 components UI
03:30:35.560 button variant of outline on
03:30:40.920 click empty function because this is the
03:30:44.000 credit card icon and billing option.
03:30:48.880 Give it a class name of size four and
03:30:51.920 text black. Go ahead and copy and paste
03:30:55.279 this and change this one to be our on
03:30:59.359 log out
03:31:00.920 method. Log out icon and log
03:31:05.960 out just like
03:31:07.960 that. So now when you go ahead and click
03:31:11.760 on mobile you will see that you have a
03:31:13.920 much much nicer experience. you have a
03:31:16.560 proper drawer. When switching to
03:31:19.359 desktop, it will open in a normal uh
03:31:23.279 drop-down menu. So, that's how we're
03:31:25.760 going to handle responsivity in this
03:31:27.439 project. And the buttons should work
03:31:29.520 normally. Let's see. Log out. There we
03:31:31.840 go. Perfect
03:31:33.239 responsivity. Great. Amazing. Amazing
03:31:35.600 job. I think uh that wraps it up. So, we
03:31:40.000 added the responsivity. And now, let's
03:31:42.560 go ahead and just merge the pull request
03:31:44.319 here. So uh I have opened this. I have
03:31:48.000 some changes. I'm going to go inside of
03:31:49.640 here. Clicking on my branch. Creating a
03:31:52.319 new
03:31:53.000 branch
03:31:54.760 07. Uh this is dashboard navbar I
03:31:59.160 believe.
03:32:01.239 Correct. Ensure that you can see the new
03:32:03.840 branch here. Go ahead and click the plus
03:32:06.239 to add to stage all
03:32:08.840 changes. 07 dashboard navbar. commit and
03:32:13.760 publish the
03:32:15.000 branch. There we go. Now, let's go
03:32:18.520 ahead and open the pull request on
03:32:22.439 GitHub and let's see the review from
03:32:25.680 Code
03:32:28.279 Rabbit. Then here we have the summary.
03:32:31.279 We introduced the navigation bar to the
03:32:33.359 dashboard layout for improved
03:32:34.960 navigation. We added a command palent
03:32:37.359 interface for the dashboard for quick
03:32:39.279 searching or selecting items. We updated
03:32:42.239 the user menu to provide a mobile
03:32:44.160 friendly drawer experience, improving
03:32:46.160 the usability on mobile devices. And we
03:32:48.720 simplified and updated the apps font to
03:32:51.520 use inter for a cleaner appearance.
03:32:55.439 That's exactly what we did. This was a
03:32:57.040 pretty uh short chapter. In here we have
03:33:00.160 a sequence diagram. If you uh need
03:33:03.120 further or visual explanation of how our
03:33:06.479 uh drawer works, for example, detecting
03:33:08.880 the mobile or detecting the desktop as
03:33:11.920 well as the dashboard command
03:33:14.160 visualization here. Perfect. And may I
03:33:17.760 say no big comments, some nitpick
03:33:20.319 comments here as you can see, uh but no
03:33:23.040 large comments that need any action.
03:33:25.200 Great. So, let's go ahead and merge this
03:33:26.880 pull request. And once the pull request
03:33:29.520 is merged, let's go back here, select
03:33:32.720 the branch name, go back to main or
03:33:36.080 origin main and go ahead and click this
03:33:39.439 to synchronize the changes and click
03:33:41.800 okay. And then when you click on your
03:33:44.880 source control here and go inside of the
03:33:47.200 graph, you will see that we just merged
03:33:50.080 07 dashboard navbar. Amazing amazing
03:33:54.239 job. Let's mark this as completed and
03:33:56.880 see you in the next
03:33:59.479 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
03:34:02.080 go ahead and set up TRPC in our project.
03:34:06.160 After we've done that, we are going to
03:34:08.319 experiment using it with a client
03:34:10.880 component with a server component and
03:34:13.760 then we are going to preview prefetching
03:34:16.080 and how it works and how we are going to
03:34:18.560 use it moving on. So first things first,
03:34:22.479 ensure that you're on your uh default
03:34:25.279 branch here. Ensure that you have
03:34:27.120 synchronized all changes. You shouldn't
03:34:29.200 have any numbers in the source control
03:34:31.680 here. Everything should be up to date.
03:34:34.239 And then you can also shut down your app
03:34:36.800 simply because in the beginning all
03:34:38.479 we're going to do is install a bunch of
03:34:41.239 packages. So head to trpc.io io or use
03:34:45.040 the link in the description and let me
03:34:47.439 show you how you can find the
03:34:48.840 documentation that will tell us what we
03:34:51.279 need to do in nextJS. So you can click
03:34:54.239 on the quick start which will take you
03:34:55.680 to the documentation and in here uh you
03:34:59.200 will have some uh options like backend
03:35:02.640 usage and client usage and in here you
03:35:06.399 will notice that you have nextjs
03:35:08.640 integration that's because they still
03:35:10.560 support explaining how to set it up with
03:35:13.279 the pages router this is not what we are
03:35:16.800 looking for what we need is one of these
03:35:20.479 either the tanstack react query or React
03:35:24.399 Query. So, I previously used this type
03:35:28.319 of integration, but nowadays they have
03:35:31.760 this complete new rewrite of how you use
03:35:35.040 Tstack Query with TRPC and honestly it
03:35:38.640 makes so much more sense and it's
03:35:40.640 actually simpler to use and it's the
03:35:43.760 recommended way of going forward. So,
03:35:47.760 this is what you have to find. go inside
03:35:50.720 of DRPC documentation client usage 10
03:35:53.600 stack react query and not in the setup
03:35:56.399 if you want to you can go in the setup
03:35:58.319 and you know uh but you can see that
03:36:00.399 you're missing some things like the
03:36:01.760 server router like where does this come
03:36:03.760 from so that's why I recommend that you
03:36:05.840 go inside of server components first and
03:36:08.880 in here you will read how to set up the
03:36:12.319 RPC with tanstack react query using
03:36:15.200 their new integration using server
03:36:18.399 components which basically can be
03:36:20.319 translated to
03:36:22.359 Nex.js app router. So basically they are
03:36:25.600 doing a separation of server components
03:36:27.600 and client components. That's why uh
03:36:29.920 while the documentation might be a
03:36:31.520 little bit confusing in here you can
03:36:33.680 find everything you need for the Nex.js
03:36:36.520 integration. So let's go ahead and start
03:36:39.279 with installing the dependencies. So I'm
03:36:42.800 just going to copy this entire thing
03:36:45.160 here and paste it. But I will also show
03:36:48.479 you uh the versions that I am using. So
03:36:52.319 my DRPC server here is
03:36:57.399 11.1.2. My TRPC client very importantly
03:37:00.880 will match that version. And my TRPC
03:37:04.000 10stack react query will also match that
03:37:07.200 version. Now for tenstack react query,
03:37:10.960 not TRPC tanstack react query. actual
03:37:13.520 tanstack react query they use latest but
03:37:16.800 I will prefer using the exact version
03:37:19.840 just for this tutorial's sake right
03:37:23.200 obviously if you were developing this on
03:37:24.800 your own it's completely fine to use the
03:37:26.960 latest versions but for this tutorial I
03:37:29.279 want to ensure longevity and the zod
03:37:31.439 version will be 3.25.7
03:37:33.080 25.7 client only and server only. Uh it
03:37:36.960 doesn't really matter. These versions
03:37:38.239 don't change too much and I don't think
03:37:39.680 anything will be breaking here. But of
03:37:41.439 course I will show you which versions I
03:37:43.120 got installed. So why am I adding
03:37:45.920 versions for these things and why am I
03:37:48.960 adding versions for Zod, right? So the
03:37:52.000 reason I'm adding versions for all of
03:37:53.840 these is because you can see that if one
03:37:56.000 of them is 11.1.2,
03:37:58.960 2 the others need to be that version as
03:38:01.960 well. The other reason is you can see
03:38:05.359 for example tanstack react query has a
03:38:07.760 warning the package is currently in beta
03:38:10.080 as we stabilize stabilize the API. We
03:38:12.800 might do breaking changes without
03:38:14.800 respecting simber. So what does this
03:38:17.200 sentence mean? It means that usually you
03:38:19.760 would expect the breaking change in a
03:38:21.439 major version change. But since they are
03:38:23.520 in beta, the breaking change might come
03:38:26.160 in
03:38:27.640 11.1.3, right? That's why I'm telling
03:38:29.840 you that for this tutorial, it might be
03:38:31.600 safer and it might save you some
03:38:33.359 headaches to simply use the same
03:38:35.040 versions that I'm using. And I'm also
03:38:38.160 pinning the tanstack react query version
03:38:40.960 simply because I know that this version
03:38:43.120 is compatible with this. And why do I
03:38:45.920 pin zod version? Well, that's because
03:38:48.319 Zod is also in some kind of
03:38:50.479 transitioning phase where they are
03:38:52.399 introducing version 4. So, depending on
03:38:55.680 when you watch this video, version 4
03:38:57.520 might become, you know, the default to
03:38:59.920 use. But this is the current highest
03:39:01.760 version that I have been able to found.
03:39:03.840 And we'll see uh how compatible it is
03:39:06.640 with these other ones. But this is the
03:39:09.279 reason why I'm doing that because
03:39:10.479 there's a lot of moving versions here, a
03:39:12.239 lot of beta things, a lot of breaking
03:39:13.920 changes. And I just want to make it
03:39:15.600 easier for you to follow along. And go
03:39:17.840 ahead and add
03:39:19.720 d-leacy fear deps and wait for a second
03:39:24.239 for this to install. There we go. So no
03:39:27.600 need to start anything immediately. We
03:39:29.680 can just go back here and let's create
03:39:32.000 the TRPC router. So we're going to go
03:39:34.800 inside of source create a new folder
03:39:37.000 trpc and inside let's create
03:39:40.920 init.ts and go ahead and click on this
03:39:43.600 view sample back end. Now just a small
03:39:47.279 note in case this documentation changes
03:39:49.760 and you can no longer find these code
03:39:51.840 snippets don't worry. Uh so this is how
03:39:54.640 I'm going to do it. I'm going to copy
03:39:56.000 it. I'm going to paste it here and I'm
03:39:58.239 just going to you know slowly scroll so
03:40:00.720 that you can see exactly what's inside.
03:40:02.399 It's not a very big code snippet. In
03:40:04.640 case the documentation no longer shows
03:40:06.399 it, you will have no problem writing it
03:40:08.600 yourself. There we go. So, just add this
03:40:11.359 in the init file. Now, what we have to
03:40:14.560 do is we have to create our uh app
03:40:18.160 router which will handle all of our
03:40:20.160 procedures and different routers, right?
03:40:22.720 So, we are doing that inside of TRPC
03:40:26.600 routers_app.ts. So inside of the TRRPC
03:40:29.040 folder, go ahead and create routers and
03:40:31.920 inside
03:40:34.359 create_app.ts and paste this inside.
03:40:37.600 There we go. And you can see that it can
03:40:39.200 find dot.init, which is this file right
03:40:41.840 here.
03:40:43.319 Perfect. After you have added that,
03:40:46.160 let's go ahead and let's add to our app
03:40:48.399 folder API TRPC dynamic TRPC
03:40:53.239 route.ts. So we can copy this and we
03:40:55.680 will have to modify this snippet a bit
03:40:57.680 because you can see they're using a
03:40:59.120 different type of alias
03:41:01.239 here. So let's go inside of app folder
03:41:04.359 API. Let's create the TRPC folder. Then
03:41:08.560 let's go ahead and create another folder
03:41:10.479 TRPC inside of square brackets and
03:41:13.040 finally route
03:41:15.399 TS. So app API TRPC TRPC in square
03:41:19.600 brackets route TS and paste this here.
03:41:23.920 And we are now going to modify these two
03:41:26.640 to not use this squiggly line but
03:41:28.560 instead the at sign because that is our
03:41:31.680 uh default alias. So this leads the
03:41:34.080 import to source folder and then we can
03:41:37.040 access the RPC from there. There we go.
03:41:40.000 So I think that's all we need for the
03:41:42.800 setup. So let's leave it like this for
03:41:46.040 now. Often when I go through this
03:41:48.800 documentation I forgot to do something.
03:41:50.880 So I'm trying to be as careful as
03:41:52.560 possible that that does not
03:41:54.840 happen. So in order to use the RPC both
03:41:58.479 in client and in server components, we
03:42:00.640 will need to have client factories and
03:42:03.120 server factories to handle that. Right?
03:42:05.600 So let's go ahead and create a
03:42:07.640 queryclient factory. So I'm going to
03:42:09.840 copy this and create
03:42:13.399 query-client.ts. So let's close this.
03:42:17.120 Let's go inside of TRPC and
03:42:21.080 query-client.ts and let's paste it here.
03:42:23.279 And I will now slowly go over this. So
03:42:26.720 in here we have the import. In here we
03:42:29.120 have the super JSON import which we can
03:42:30.960 comment out because A we don't have the
03:42:32.960 package installed and B we are not using
03:42:34.800 it yet. And after that we simply export
03:42:38.080 a function make query client. This is
03:42:40.160 basically the tanstack query setup.
03:42:42.880 That's it. We will later enable the
03:42:45.439 serialization. And I just want to finish
03:42:47.439 following through with the setup. Great.
03:42:50.000 So that's the query client. Uh and now
03:42:53.920 let's go ahead and see what else we
03:42:55.680 have. And if you want to read more about
03:42:57.040 it, you can pause the screen or go to
03:42:59.040 the documentation here. Now let's go
03:43:02.000 ahead and create a TRPC client for
03:43:04.479 client components. So I'm going to copy
03:43:07.680 this and I'm going to create inside of
03:43:09.439 the DRPC folder
03:43:13.560 client.tsx like this. Let me close
03:43:15.680 everything else.
03:43:17.560 client.tsx and let's paste that inside
03:43:20.239 of here. So in here we mark it as use
03:43:23.120 client. We do all of these imports right
03:43:26.800 here. And then we add our makequery
03:43:30.640 client from this which we've just added
03:43:33.920 previously, right? Make query client.
03:43:37.040 And we import the app router type from
03:43:40.840 our routers here because this is where
03:43:43.439 we are going to add all of our different
03:43:45.439 routers. So in here it will have the app
03:43:47.920 router to give the context and the type
03:43:49.920 interference for all of them. So I'm
03:43:52.720 just going over this slowly in case you
03:43:55.359 cannot find that code snippet and want
03:43:57.439 to type it yourself. So in here we
03:43:59.439 define the function get query client
03:44:01.840 which I suppose it's doing it uh so it's
03:44:05.239 compatible during server side rendering
03:44:07.840 here even though this is a client uh a a
03:44:12.399 even though this is a provider for the
03:44:14.000 client component usage uh it we still
03:44:16.800 have to handle server side rendering
03:44:19.040 that's different from a server component
03:44:20.640 so that's it's doing
03:44:22.120 this and after that we have this get URL
03:44:25.439 which I uh definitely want to modify I
03:44:28.800 think is a bit unnecessarily complicated
03:44:31.760 and it's optimized for Versel. But what
03:44:34.239 if you're not deploying on Versel,
03:44:36.239 right? So how about we do this? So find
03:44:40.800 get URL method or if you're in the
03:44:42.720 middle of typing it, go ahead and stop
03:44:44.560 here and instead let's go to our
03:44:46.880 environment here and let's add next
03:44:49.520 public app URL. And in here we're
03:44:53.120 basically just going we can copy the
03:44:55.120 better out URL because it's exactly the
03:44:57.040 same. It's basically where we have our
03:44:58.960 app running. If you are unsure, you can
03:45:00.880 do npm rundev and you will see exactly
03:45:02.880 where it's running like this and just
03:45:05.520 add it here. Be mindful of the protocol
03:45:07.520 and of the port. So this will be much
03:45:10.640 easier to do because you can see that
03:45:12.160 versel URL does not include the
03:45:14.160 protocol. So then they have to attach it
03:45:16.080 to the protocol. It's just a mess to
03:45:18.160 work with. Instead, what we can just do
03:45:20.160 is remove these two lines and just do
03:45:23.439 return process.vironment environment
03:45:26.239 next public app URL. Please copy and
03:45:28.479 paste so you don't accidentally
03:45:29.920 misspell. That's it. And what's
03:45:32.160 important here is that you have actually
03:45:34.319 defined the TRPC folder in the /
03:45:37.800 API/TRPC. So be mindful of that. API
03:45:40.720 TRPC. Make sure you didn't misspell
03:45:43.319 it. And finally, we have the TRPC React
03:45:46.560 provider, which combines the query
03:45:48.880 client with the TRPC. We are later going
03:45:51.520 to enable the superjson transformer. And
03:45:54.479 finally, it adds all the necessary
03:45:56.880 providers using the tenstack query and
03:45:59.040 the TRPC. And now we can wrap our
03:46:01.600 application into that. Great. So I hope
03:46:04.880 that kind of explained it. I will once
03:46:06.800 again go through this
03:46:08.439 slowly in case you are typing it out
03:46:11.359 line by line. So now let's go ahead and
03:46:15.359 let's mount the provider in the root of
03:46:17.359 our application. So I'm going to go
03:46:19.760 inside of layout right here. So this
03:46:22.560 root layout in the app
03:46:24.520 folder and I'm going to go ahead and
03:46:27.479 import gRPC react provider. So be
03:46:30.800 mindful here not to import the wrong
03:46:33.640 thing.
03:46:35.399 PRPC I already forgot what it's called
03:46:38.160 react
03:46:39.080 provider from at TRPC client. The reason
03:46:42.640 I I'm telling you to be mindful is
03:46:44.640 because autocomplete intellisense might
03:46:47.120 pull you and you might import uh a a
03:46:50.000 similarly named provider which is not
03:46:52.399 what we want. So now let's go ahead and
03:46:55.359 simply wrap our entire app into
03:46:58.840 that like that. And there we go. Now we
03:47:01.760 can safely use the RPC and tenstack
03:47:04.800 query throughout our application.
03:47:08.399 Now we have to create an equivalent
03:47:10.080 caller for server components because
03:47:12.000 this is useless in server components but
03:47:14.319 it will be quite handy for us to access
03:47:16.960 our TRPC router in a server component.
03:47:20.319 So again I'm going to copy this and
03:47:22.000 create trpc
03:47:24.359 server.tsx. So let's go inside of here
03:47:29.000 server.tsx like
03:47:30.840 this and let's paste it here.
03:47:36.080 So now what we're going to do is first
03:47:38.720 ensure that you have server only and I
03:47:41.279 just remember that I forgot to show you.
03:47:43.600 So client only
03:47:46.199 0.0.1 server only 0.0.1. Those are my
03:47:50.760 versions. Great. And in here you should
03:47:54.080 have no problems with this relative
03:47:55.840 imports because it's all in the same
03:47:57.600 folder. So we have the init, we have the
03:47:59.600 query client and we have the routers
03:48:01.880 app. And you can remove this part. So
03:48:05.120 this is if the router is on a separate
03:48:06.800 server. That's not the case for us. So
03:48:08.720 we can remove that. And this is the cool
03:48:11.520 thing. So usually uh if you were attempt
03:48:14.880 to you know fetch your data in a server
03:48:16.880 component uh using some kind of
03:48:19.319 abstraction like hono RPC, what it would
03:48:23.760 do is it would actually do a fetch
03:48:26.560 request on your server which is
03:48:29.359 unnecessary overhead. But that isn't the
03:48:31.680 biggest issue. That's not it's not
03:48:33.520 slowing anything down too much. The
03:48:35.680 issue is if you're doing a fetch request
03:48:37.920 in a server component, you're losing
03:48:39.840 authentication there. You need to fill
03:48:42.000 that fetch request with cookies and
03:48:43.680 headers. Well, this kind of server
03:48:47.120 module for
03:48:48.359 TRPC will allow us to natively call TRPC
03:48:54.000 procedures in server components
03:48:56.000 preserving the AL state. That's why this
03:48:59.359 is so good. So there is no uh fetch
03:49:01.760 request happening here. It will directly
03:49:04.640 call the TRPC procedures. You will see
03:49:08.000 more of this in action later on. Uh
03:49:11.439 great. So in here they immediately show
03:49:14.319 you the prefetching example which I
03:49:16.319 think is a bit complicated if you've
03:49:18.560 never seen this before but basically
03:49:20.960 pre-fetching allows us to combine the
03:49:24.000 best of both worlds. We are the when
03:49:26.640 next.js GS page loads. The first thing
03:49:28.560 it loads is a server component. And in
03:49:31.520 here we have the option to prefetch a
03:49:34.319 query. For example, you we just loaded a
03:49:37.040 meeting with meeting ID 1 2 3. So what
03:49:40.239 we're going to do in the server
03:49:41.359 component is we're going to start the
03:49:43.439 prefetch. We're going to say, okay,
03:49:45.279 start prefetching this immediately. And
03:49:47.920 then we're going to wrap this into the
03:49:49.520 hydration boundary. And then in the
03:49:52.399 client component, we're going to use the
03:49:54.239 client DRPC integration. And in here we
03:49:57.840 will be able to load a already loaded
03:50:01.840 data right because the server component
03:50:04.640 will already put the data into cache. So
03:50:08.080 our client component will be ready to
03:50:10.279 immediately use it right and we are also
03:50:13.760 going to be able to use use suspense
03:50:16.319 query with that and then we are going to
03:50:19.359 have an even better developer experience
03:50:21.600 for us. I know it's all a bit too much
03:50:23.520 overwhelming at the moment, but uh
03:50:25.840 you're going to see when we start doing
03:50:27.359 this how helpful it really is, but uh
03:50:31.120 how about we go ahead and actually try a
03:50:33.760 very simple example. So what I'm trying
03:50:35.359 to do here is the following. Let's go in
03:50:39.760 inside of our TRPC routers. And in here
03:50:43.199 we can see hello base procedure. So a
03:50:45.920 pretty simple procedure. How about we go
03:50:48.880 inside of our modules home home view
03:50:52.000 because this is a client component. Make
03:50:54.080 sure you have your app running here. And
03:50:56.399 this is what we're going to do now. So
03:50:58.239 we no longer need to display anything
03:51:00.319 else related. We have that in the
03:51:02.479 sidebar now. But what we can do is the
03:51:05.680 following. We can learn how to use TRPC
03:51:08.399 here. So let's first add TRPC hook. So
03:51:12.319 const TRPC is use TRPC from TRPC client
03:51:16.960 and then in here we would have the data
03:51:19.840 which would be use query from tan stack
03:51:22.960 query and then in here usually what you
03:51:25.279 would do is you would create your
03:51:26.720 fetcher and then pass the body. What
03:51:28.960 they have done is they have separated
03:51:31.439 the API from tRPC and use query. So you
03:51:34.800 use query and you learn use query
03:51:37.880 independently right you are not learning
03:51:40.600 tRPC you are learning tanstack query
03:51:44.319 that's the cool thing about this new
03:51:46.000 integration they've done usually what
03:51:48.160 you would do is tRC dot uh your
03:51:51.880 procedure dot use query but that would
03:51:55.439 require you to learn this whole new
03:51:57.600 syntax whereas with this one all you
03:52:00.399 already know use query most likely right
03:52:03.359 so all you have to do is pass hello and
03:52:07.439 query options inside and let's pass in
03:52:10.560 is it name? Let's just see hello text.
03:52:14.880 Okay, let's pass in text to be
03:52:18.600 Antonio. And then in here simply render
03:52:22.120 data greeting with a question mark here.
03:52:26.000 So now when you go to localhost 3000 and
03:52:28.560 refresh this, this should no longer
03:52:31.120 exist and instead it should say hello
03:52:34.840 Antonio. There we go. Hello Antonio. So
03:52:37.279 it loaded for a second and then it said
03:52:40.000 hello Antonio. So that's how you would
03:52:42.080 use it in a client component. Quite
03:52:45.199 normal. Nothing too unusual, right? But
03:52:48.160 we can also use it in a server component
03:52:50.560 if we need to. So let's just do that
03:52:52.560 before we wrap up the chapter. So
03:52:54.640 getting data in a server component you
03:52:56.720 would almost never you will almost never
03:53:00.479 need this right but if you really really
03:53:04.319 need data in a server component you can
03:53:07.680 right so what we're going to do is let's
03:53:10.160 just go inside of app folder dashboard
03:53:13.399 page and what I'm going to do here is
03:53:17.680 I'm going to fetch the greeting the same
03:53:20.800 way so con greeting will be awake Wait.
03:53:24.960 And let's see what do we need to import
03:53:26.720 a caller function. And I'm not even sure
03:53:29.359 if I have it. Yes, they are telling me
03:53:31.760 that I need to export it because we will
03:53:34.319 never use this. But just to demonstrate
03:53:36.319 to you that you can still do it. Let's
03:53:38.560 go inside of TRPC
03:53:40.960 uh server. If it's easy enough to do, we
03:53:43.040 will do it. If it's complicated, we will
03:53:44.960 just skip. Let's see. Okay. All I need
03:53:47.439 is the caller. Expert con color caller
03:53:50.080 app router create color and pass in
03:53:52.080 this. Perfect. Let's import the caller
03:53:54.960 from TRPC server. So caller hello text
03:53:59.720 Antonio
03:54:01.640 server and then in here we're just going
03:54:04.319 to return a
03:54:06.199 paragraph
03:54:07.720 greeting greeting. So this would
03:54:09.840 technically be data and then data
03:54:13.439 greeting. So now I'm overwriting that
03:54:16.560 client component and you can see hello
03:54:18.399 and new server. So I just wanted to
03:54:21.199 demonstrate to you that it's possible to
03:54:22.880 do this as well. But we won't be doing
03:54:24.960 that. We'll be doing the third option
03:54:27.359 which is the pre-fetching leveraging
03:54:29.359 both the speed of server components and
03:54:31.600 the knowledge and the um uh I'm not sure
03:54:36.000 what's the correct term to use a
03:54:37.920 familiarity of the client components
03:54:40.000 right because we're use used to this we
03:54:41.840 know how to work with this right but it
03:54:43.680 would be nice to leverage the speed of
03:54:45.439 the server components which load sooner
03:54:48.080 than the client components so you're
03:54:49.920 going to see us combine all of that in
03:54:51.600 one uh great but we just tested both so
03:54:54.560 we know that both the client and the
03:54:56.160 server iteration of these are working
03:54:58.560 and we're going to learn more about the
03:55:00.720 RPC as we go forward. So we've done this
03:55:04.560 this and this and I forgot to do one
03:55:07.439 more step which is to uh merge the pull
03:55:10.640 request. So let's go ahead and do that.
03:55:13.199 So I have 11 uh uncommitted changes
03:55:16.680 here. Let's go ahead and change the
03:55:19.359 branch first. New branch. This will be
03:55:22.560 08 DRPC
03:55:26.760 setup. Great. Let's confirm I'm on the
03:55:30.080 new branch. And let's click the plus
03:55:31.920 icon to stage all of our changes here.
03:55:34.399 And let's do 08 PRPC setup. And let's
03:55:38.000 commit. And let's publish the branch.
03:55:40.720 There we go. And let's go ahead and open
03:55:44.000 a pull request to see what Code Rabbit
03:55:47.359 has to say about this. though I won't
03:55:49.520 change it much simply because this is
03:55:50.960 the official documentation. So I'm just
03:55:53.439 going to follow how they've done it. But
03:55:55.279 still let's see what AI has to say about
03:55:59.160 this. And here we have the summary. So
03:56:02.239 let's read through the walkthrough this
03:56:04.000 time. This update integrates DRPC and
03:56:07.279 React Query into the project introducing
03:56:09.600 new API routes, server and client
03:56:11.920 utilities, and a context provider for
03:56:14.000 the app. Authentication logic is removed
03:56:16.560 from the home view because we removed
03:56:18.319 it, right? And which now displays data
03:56:21.279 fetched via TRPC. Several supporting
03:56:24.239 modules and dependencies are added or
03:56:26.479 updated to enable seamless type- safe
03:56:28.800 API calls. And that was pretty much the
03:56:31.120 point of this chapter. And this is where
03:56:33.600 you will finally see these sequence
03:56:35.439 diagrams become increasingly more useful
03:56:38.080 especially if you're struggling to
03:56:40.080 understand uh all of these types of uh
03:56:43.199 uh TRPC calls right server TRPC client
03:56:46.560 TRPC
03:56:48.080 uh hybrid with pre-fetching. So this
03:56:50.640 will come in quite handy in here. For
03:56:52.479 example, you can see a very very simple
03:56:54.399 one which is a usepc with use query for
03:56:58.479 the hello procedure where we pass the
03:57:00.800 text and we bring back from the app
03:57:02.960 router the greeting with that text
03:57:04.960 included and then render it back. In
03:57:07.920 here we have some comments but these are
03:57:11.680 just demonstrations right we will
03:57:13.920 obviously remove this. So it's making
03:57:16.800 sure that we are careful with this query
03:57:18.720 that we have the error and loading field
03:57:22.000 but we are going to remove it anyway and
03:57:23.840 we will handle error and loading but in
03:57:25.760 a different way using
03:57:27.560 suspense. We are also going to implement
03:57:30.479 proper protected procedures later on.
03:57:32.560 You can see how it already suggested
03:57:34.160 that right here. Perfect. And in here of
03:57:38.239 course it recommends a fallback but um
03:57:41.199 we don't really need a fallback. you
03:57:42.640 know, if you don't add this environment
03:57:44.000 variable, the app will not work either
03:57:45.920 way because we will use it for some
03:57:47.439 other things later
03:57:48.840 on. And finally, the caller here, which
03:57:52.560 again does not matter uh because we only
03:57:54.880 added it to demonstrate how you can use
03:57:57.680 TRPC for purely server component call.
03:58:01.040 But still, you can see how uh for
03:58:04.120 seemingly harmless pull request, it
03:58:06.800 noticed so many things that could go
03:58:08.960 wrong, right? Luckily for us, most of
03:58:10.720 this is just for demonstration, but
03:58:13.199 definitely a useful tool to have. Let's
03:58:16.319 go ahead and merge this pull
03:58:18.120 request. And after it's merged, go back
03:58:20.880 to your IDE, select the main branch, and
03:58:24.560 go ahead and synchronize the changes. To
03:58:28.479 double check, you can click on the
03:58:29.760 source control here, open the graph, and
03:58:32.479 just confirm that you have emerged the
03:58:34.800 TRPC setup. Perfect. Amazing. Amazing
03:58:38.880 job and see you in the next
03:58:42.199 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
03:58:44.800 go ahead and set up the agents entity in
03:58:48.960 our project. This will include adding
03:58:51.439 the agents schema module, TRPC
03:58:55.359 procedures, some client pages, and we're
03:58:58.479 going to create reusable loading and
03:59:00.720 error
03:59:01.560 states. Let's start with the agent
03:59:04.239 schema.
03:59:05.760 First things first, ensure that you're
03:59:07.840 on your main branch here and feel free
03:59:11.439 to synchronize changes if you haven't
03:59:15.520 and make sure you have no active numbers
03:59:18.319 here, meaning everything was merged,
03:59:20.960 everything is up to
03:59:22.439 date. So, what I want to do now is run
03:59:26.319 mpm install nano ID legacy peer
03:59:31.880 deps. Great. Now let's go ahead and run
03:59:34.880 our app. Now let's go inside of source
03:59:38.920 database schema. Inside of here we have
03:59:42.880 all the tables added by better out. So
03:59:46.640 what we are going to do now is import
03:59:49.760 nano id from nano
03:59:54.040 id and we are going to create our table.
03:59:58.800 So let's go ahead and export const
04:00:01.800 agents. PG table
04:00:08.840 agents. The ID is going to be a type of
04:00:12.080 text with the column name ID. It will be
04:00:15.359 a primary key. And we are going to add a
04:00:18.000 default function here to assign a nano
04:00:21.199 ID. The reason I'm using Nano ID is
04:00:24.319 because they are shorter and much more
04:00:26.560 readable than UYU IDs. Let's go ahead
04:00:30.000 and set the name field to use the name
04:00:33.520 column name and it's going to be
04:00:36.760 required. User ID is going to be a text
04:00:40.439 field. User ID will be the column name.
04:00:45.439 It will be required and it's going to be
04:00:47.359 a reference to our existing user table.
04:00:51.920 specifically targeting the ID field. So
04:00:55.600 we are referring to this user table
04:00:58.399 right here. This ID field and we are
04:01:01.840 going to add a rule. If the user is
04:01:04.800 deleted, we are going to cascade meaning
04:01:07.680 deleting this agent as
04:01:09.640 well. Let's add
04:01:12.199 instructions to be a type of text with a
04:01:15.359 column name instructions. And let's just
04:01:18.080 make it required. And we are then going
04:01:20.640 to have created at which will be a type
04:01:23.760 of timestamp created at required and
04:01:28.479 default. Now copy and paste this and
04:01:31.840 change it to updated ad and change this
04:01:35.279 to updated ad as well. There we go. We
04:01:38.800 have our new agents table. So everything
04:01:41.760 above here is better out and everything
04:01:45.279 starting from the agents will be our
04:01:47.600 tables. Great. Now that we have our new
04:01:51.880 agent schema, let's go ahead and let's
04:01:55.920 run database
04:01:58.359 push. So, npm run database
04:02:05.000 push. And there we go. Changes applied.
04:02:09.439 So, now you have two options. You can
04:02:11.279 either go on neon and look at the table
04:02:14.160 or you can run database studio. So
04:02:17.199 whichever one you prefer, you can go to
04:02:21.479 local.drizle.studio to find the studio
04:02:23.520 here or you can go to your neon console
04:02:27.080 here and go inside of the tables and you
04:02:30.560 will find the exact same studio here. So
04:02:33.600 now you have the agents and in here you
04:02:36.319 have ID, name, user ID, instructions,
04:02:39.279 created at and updated at. And the last
04:02:41.840 one is a repeated user which is
04:02:43.840 basically just the relation which will
04:02:46.080 be loaded once we add the user ID.
04:02:49.479 Perfect. So we added the agents schema.
04:02:54.239 Now what I want to do is I want to add
04:02:56.319 the agents
04:02:59.000 module. So let's go ahead and close
04:03:01.600 everything. Let's go inside of source
04:03:04.279 modules and let's add agents here.
04:03:08.319 And then inside of here, let's add a
04:03:10.399 server folder. And let's add
04:03:15.800 procedures.ts. Inside of the procedures
04:03:18.840 here, I want to
04:03:22.199 import create brpc router from trpc init
04:03:27.439 and base procedure from trpc in it.
04:03:32.239 Let's export const agents
04:03:35.880 router and let's make it create trpc
04:03:39.560 router and let's add get many to be base
04:03:42.640 procedure query and it's going to be a
04:03:45.680 simple asynchronous
04:03:48.279 function and inside of here we're just
04:03:51.920 going to get the data using await
04:03:54.720 database from at /
04:03:57.239 db and let's go ahead and select
04:04:02.760 from agents. So make sure to import
04:04:06.720 database and
04:04:08.439 agents and we don't need to add any
04:04:11.760 other query because we are not querying
04:04:14.319 right now by user. We are not querying
04:04:16.880 by pageionation. We are just loading all
04:04:19.720 data. So let's go ahead and return this.
04:04:23.760 Now that we have that, let's go inside
04:04:25.439 of DRPC routers app and let's go ahead
04:04:29.920 and prepare a bit. So let's import
04:04:34.040 agents router from modules agent server
04:04:37.279 procedures and let's remove the hello
04:04:39.600 procedure and add agents to be agents
04:04:42.120 router. And you can remove base
04:04:44.560 procedure and zod from here like this.
04:04:48.960 Now let's go inside of home in the
04:04:51.840 modules folder UI views home view and in
04:04:55.920 here let's clear it up entirely and
04:04:58.239 let's just say home view here you can
04:05:00.399 even remove the class
04:05:01.880 names remove these two imports and just
04:05:05.279 leave it like this. This way the
04:05:08.160 component is no longer
04:05:10.040 erroring. Great. So we now added the
04:05:14.359 procedures. Now let's go ahead and
04:05:16.880 finish the module by adding the agent
04:05:20.520 pages. So let me just go ahead and start
04:05:23.279 my app here. npm
04:05:28.120 rundev. Let's wait a second for this to
04:05:30.960 load. There we go. So we just have home
04:05:33.120 view here. And now um let's go ahead and
04:05:36.080 actually run this. Let me just move this
04:05:40.359 here bottom right. There we go. so it
04:05:43.920 doesn't cause any issues. And now let's
04:05:46.720 go ahead and develop the agents
04:05:51.160 page. So we're going to go inside of
04:05:53.359 source app folder dashboard and we're
04:05:56.160 going to create the agents folder. Then
04:05:58.640 inside of here, page
04:06:01.560 DSX. Then let's go ahead and simply do a
04:06:04.720 default export here and write agents
04:06:08.080 like this.
04:06:10.880 So now when you go ahead and click on
04:06:12.560 agents here you will see the text
04:06:15.239 agents. Now let's go ahead go inside of
04:06:18.080 modules agents and create the UI folder
04:06:21.399 inside and create a views folder inside
04:06:24.560 of UI. And finally in here create
04:06:27.439 agents- view
04:06:30.040 tsx mark it as use
04:06:32.680 client import usec from tRPC client.
04:06:38.000 import use query from tanstack react
04:06:42.600 query. Now let's export const agents
04:06:45.439 view
04:06:48.040 here. Let's go ahead and prepare trc
04:06:51.120 using use query. My apologies
04:06:54.199 use and let's get the data by using use
04:06:57.840 query here. PRPC agents get many query
04:07:03.319 options like this.
04:07:06.720 Let's go ahead and return a div JSON
04:07:09.279 stringify data null and
04:07:13.319 two. So null and two is basically used
04:07:18.399 to format the JSON stringification in a
04:07:21.760 nice way so it's easier to
04:07:23.960 read. And let's also do the following.
04:07:28.000 Is
04:07:29.560 loading.
04:07:32.040 if is loading. Let's go ahead and return
04:07:35.439 a
04:07:36.439 div
04:07:39.239 loading and
04:07:42.279 if is
04:07:46.199 error, let's return a div
04:07:51.000 error like this. And I just have to wrap
04:07:54.239 it this in parenthesis because I can't
04:07:57.120 look at it like that. Okay, great. So
04:08:01.199 now let's go to the page here inside of
04:08:03.439 our dashboard agents page and let's go
04:08:06.479 ahead and directly return the agents
04:08:08.680 view like
04:08:10.600 this. And there we go. You're now able
04:08:13.439 to click add agents, right? And you will
04:08:16.960 just see an empty array. So, what you
04:08:21.040 can do is you can go inside of your
04:08:22.560 either Neon Console or Drizzle Studio,
04:08:25.040 whatever you have up and running, go
04:08:27.199 inside of agents and click add record.
04:08:29.359 For ID, you can just go ahead and type
04:08:31.680 whatever you want because it's a type of
04:08:34.239 text. Uh yeah, but before you do this,
04:08:36.800 yeah, let's just discard this. Go to
04:08:38.960 your users and just pick uh at least one
04:08:42.080 user here. Just pick an ID for the user.
04:08:45.520 Copy it. Go instead of agents, click add
04:08:47.840 record. Write whatever you want for the
04:08:50.319 ID for the agent. The name can be first
04:08:53.040 agent and then user ID. Paste the ID
04:08:56.239 that you've added in the instructions.
04:08:58.800 Add you are an agent. It really doesn't
04:09:01.920 matter. And created and updated at our
04:09:04.640 default. So you can click save one
04:09:06.319 change. And there we go. That will
04:09:08.479 create an
04:09:10.040 agent with a relation to the user. In
04:09:12.960 case you fail at doing this, no problem
04:09:15.520 at all. I'm literally just adding one
04:09:17.520 record. simply so we can see something
04:09:19.760 being loaded here. Right? That's the
04:09:21.520 only reason why I'm doing this. If you
04:09:23.040 are failing at doing it, don't worry. Uh
04:09:26.560 great. So now that we have this uh let's
04:09:30.000 go ahead and uh spice it up a little
04:09:33.520 bit, right? So let's go inside of the
04:09:35.760 agents view here. Let's go inside of get
04:09:37.920 many. And how about I go
04:09:41.479 here and I
04:09:44.120 purposely make it slower by using await
04:09:47.520 new promise
04:09:50.199 resolve set timeout resolve 5,000. So
04:09:54.479 I'm purposely adding 5 seconds here. So
04:09:57.279 let's refresh this. And now you can see
04:09:58.960 our loading state being active here uh
04:10:02.080 for 5 seconds before it loads. Now let's
04:10:05.520 comment this out and instead let's throw
04:10:07.880 new PRPC error here with a code bad
04:10:13.520 request for
04:10:15.479 example. Let's refresh this as well. So
04:10:19.279 it's going to load. It's going to load
04:10:21.199 for a couple of times until it
04:10:23.399 eventually hits the error I believe. And
04:10:26.080 there we go. So after a couple of
04:10:28.000 retries it shows the error state.
04:10:31.359 Perfect. So we now have a little
04:10:33.359 shortcuts to do both of them. So what I
04:10:36.399 want to do now is the following. I want
04:10:39.199 to build our error state and our loading
04:10:41.680 state which we are going to reuse
04:10:43.040 throughout the project. So let's go
04:10:44.880 inside of source components and create
04:10:48.399 loading state
04:10:50.680 tsx and do the
04:10:53.399 following.
04:10:55.160 Import loader to icon from lucid react.
04:10:59.680 Create an
04:11:00.920 interface props with a title of string
04:11:04.000 and description of
04:11:06.840 string. Export loading
04:11:11.479 state like
04:11:13.399 this. The structure the props
04:11:16.920 here. So you can obtain the title and
04:11:19.840 the
04:11:20.840 description. And inside of here return a
04:11:24.439 div. The div will have a class name.
04:11:27.359 Whoops. py 4 px8 flex flex one items
04:11:35.279 center and justify center. The div will
04:11:39.520 have a class name of flex flex call
04:11:42.560 items center
04:11:44.920 justify center gap y 6 bg
04:11:52.120 backgrounded large padding of 10 and
04:11:55.439 shadow sm. Inside of here add a loader 2
04:11:59.680 icon which we have imported above and
04:12:01.760 give it a class name of size six and
04:12:04.000 animate spin.
04:12:07.199 And let's also give it a text primary.
04:12:10.160 Let me just fix the typo in my animate
04:12:12.319 spin class name here. Below this, open
04:12:15.120 up a div with a class name flex flex
04:12:18.000 column gap y2 and text center. Inside of
04:12:22.160 this div, you will have a heading six
04:12:24.479 which will render the title and below it
04:12:27.199 a paragraph which will render the
04:12:29.439 description.
04:12:32.080 Go ahead and give the heading a class
04:12:33.760 name of text
04:12:35.640 large and font
04:12:38.760 medium and give the paragraph a class
04:12:41.399 name text
04:12:43.560 small. There we go. Now let's head back
04:12:47.040 inside of our agents view. Inside of
04:12:49.920 modules agents UI views agents view.
04:12:53.439 Instead of returning this, we are now
04:12:55.439 going to return our loading
04:12:57.239 state like that.
04:13:00.960 Let's go ahead and give this a title
04:13:02.640 uploading agents and a description of
04:13:05.920 this may take a few
04:13:11.319 seconds like
04:13:13.319 this. So now let's go back inside of our
04:13:16.920 procedures and let's enable our 5-second
04:13:20.880 timeout. And there we go. Now we have a
04:13:23.359 nice loading state which we can reuse
04:13:25.840 throughout uh our project.
04:13:29.960 Perfect. So now what I want to do is the
04:13:33.439 following. I want to copy the loading
04:13:35.040 state, paste it here and rename it error
04:13:39.000 state. Inside of here I will import the
04:13:42.000 alert
04:13:43.920 uh let me just see which com which one
04:13:46.800 is the proper alert circle icon. Let's
04:13:49.680 use this one. And this will be called
04:13:52.479 error state. And it's simply going to
04:13:54.720 load the alert circle icon. It will
04:13:58.159 remove animate spin and it will use oops
04:14:00.720 and it will use a color text red 500
04:14:04.720 like that. Go back inside of the agents
04:14:07.600 view and in here use the error
04:14:11.640 state. Give it a
04:14:13.880 title of failed to load
04:14:19.159 agents and a description of something
04:14:23.040 went
04:14:25.239 wrong. Or maybe let's do please try
04:14:29.840 again later. And let's do error loading
04:14:35.319 agents. And in here we can remove these
04:14:39.199 three dots like this. So now how about
04:14:42.960 we enable the error and remove this so
04:14:46.319 it errors faster. So let's refresh now.
04:14:49.359 So it's loading. It's loading. It's
04:14:51.600 loading. And it will eventually hit the
04:14:54.720 error state. displaying the error. There
04:14:57.600 we go. So, what you've just learned is
04:15:00.399 how to use DRPC with usequery in the
04:15:03.760 most normal way everyone is used to
04:15:06.960 using it. And if you want to, you can
04:15:10.239 complete the entire project like this.
04:15:13.520 There is absolutely nothing wrong with
04:15:16.000 doing it like this. If you prefer having
04:15:18.479 your error states here, your loading
04:15:20.239 states here, that's perfectly fine. But
04:15:23.040 what I'm going to show you now is how to
04:15:25.520 do it by leveraging server components
04:15:28.560 because right now we are using this
04:15:30.159 agents view as the fetcher right but we
04:15:35.520 have this uh out my apologies whoops
04:15:39.840 dashboard agents page which is a server
04:15:42.840 component which has closer access to the
04:15:45.800 database than this which is essentially
04:15:48.640 a fetch API call. Right? So what if we
04:15:52.960 could already fetch the data in the
04:15:56.080 server component and then immediately
04:15:58.239 provide it to the cache here? What if we
04:16:01.920 could do that? Well, good news is we can
04:16:05.439 do exactly that. So let's turn this into
04:16:08.000 an asynchronous
04:16:09.479 component like this. And let's go ahead
04:16:13.439 and define the following const query
04:16:15.800 client. And let's do get query client
04:16:19.279 from tRPC server. So you already know
04:16:22.080 that we are going to be using the server
04:16:24.000 utilus for this one. So we get the query
04:16:26.640 client here and then what we do is avoid
04:16:30.800 query client prefetch query and inside
04:16:35.040 we do tRPC which you can also import
04:16:37.760 from the server. It's important that you
04:16:40.000 import both from TRPC server not from
04:16:42.720 anywhere else. And in here dot agents
04:16:47.199 get many and simply do query options
04:16:51.800 here just like that. So what we've done
04:16:56.000 now is we used a server components to
04:16:59.319 prefetch the agents get many. But we are
04:17:02.640 still not done. What we have to do now
04:17:05.120 is we have to wrap this agents view
04:17:09.000 component in a hydration boundary from
04:17:12.239 tanstack react query. So let's do this
04:17:16.319 and let's pass in the state here to be
04:17:18.920 dehydrate from tanstack react query and
04:17:21.760 pass in the query client like this. So
04:17:25.600 what we have done now is the following
04:17:28.800 flow. The first component that will load
04:17:31.920 when the user clicks on the agents here
04:17:35.040 will be this page this server component.
04:17:38.640 This server component will then prefetch
04:17:41.600 the RPC agents get many and it will
04:17:44.720 hydrate through hydration boundary the
04:17:48.399 react query or tanstack react query
04:17:52.040 cache. So then when the agents view
04:17:55.359 finally loads it will already have the
04:17:59.199 data inside reducing the load time. But
04:18:03.199 in order to do that properly we need to
04:18:06.319 not use use query. Instead we have to
04:18:09.680 use use suspense
04:18:11.800 query like
04:18:13.960 this. And we have to modify a couple of
04:18:16.880 things. So since we're using use
04:18:18.640 suspense query, it makes no sense to use
04:18:20.960 the error and loading here. Why? Well,
04:18:24.319 let's look at the difference. I'm just
04:18:25.680 going to control Z back. So when I hover
04:18:28.080 over data here, you can see that in here
04:18:31.680 it can be undefined, right? Because
04:18:35.439 there is a state where this data is not
04:18:38.399 loaded yet. That's why we handle is
04:18:40.560 loading. But when you switch to use
04:18:42.479 suspense
04:18:43.720 query and hover over the data, it will
04:18:47.199 never be undefined because use suspense
04:18:50.279 query has already fetched data inside of
04:18:54.239 it, already resolved data. So that's why
04:18:57.520 it doesn't make sense to use these here
04:18:59.520 at all. So you can remove them and you
04:19:02.720 can completely rely on the data here.
04:19:05.279 Instead, what we're going to do is the
04:19:07.359 following. We're going to go ahead and
04:19:09.520 wrap the agents view inside of suspense
04:19:12.479 from
04:19:13.960 React and we're going to give it a
04:19:19.080 fallback and let's just keep this things
04:19:22.000 simple. So you have two ways of doing
04:19:23.920 it. You can add loading state here if
04:19:26.080 you want to and give it a title of
04:19:29.520 loading agents and a description here of
04:19:33.040 this may take a few seconds. If you want
04:19:37.439 to, you can do it like that. Uh or you
04:19:42.319 can export con agents view
04:19:45.720 loading and then in here return the
04:19:48.640 loading
04:19:50.120 state and simply repeat these two
04:19:54.840 values like
04:19:59.479 this. And then in here you can do a
04:20:03.040 simpler version agents view loading and
04:20:07.760 you import all of them from the same
04:20:09.439 place agents view and agents view
04:20:12.120 loading whichever version you
04:20:15.159 prefer. And it's a self-closing tag.
04:20:18.080 Great. So now go inside of your
04:20:21.000 procedures for the agents
04:20:24.120 router. Whoops. And enable this 5-second
04:20:28.159 timeout. So now do a hard refresh here
04:20:30.800 and you can see it is still working but
04:20:34.560 this time it's leveraging suspense.
04:20:37.520 Great. So how do we handle uh errors
04:20:42.479 here? Well, we need an error boundary.
04:20:45.199 Now Nex.js by itself has an error
04:20:48.439 boundary. So that means that you could
04:20:50.800 go inside of uh agents page here and you
04:20:54.399 could create an
04:20:55.800 error. SX mark it as use client export.
04:21:00.880 Uh I think you need to do a default
04:21:03.040 export as well. Well, you can just call
04:21:05.359 it error page. Make sure to not call it
04:21:08.000 error because that's a reserved file
04:21:09.600 name. And you could just return the
04:21:11.680 error state here. I
04:21:13.800 believe with a title uh error loading
04:21:18.080 agents and a description
04:21:20.680 here. Something went
04:21:24.040 wrong. And I haven't tested this. But I
04:21:27.760 think it should work. So let me try and
04:21:30.640 enable the error now. And let me do a
04:21:32.479 hard refresh here. And uh I'm just going
04:21:36.159 to see if this is working. So let's wait
04:21:39.520 a few seconds. And there we go. Yeah. So
04:21:42.399 just like that uh we handled the error
04:21:46.640 state. If you want to, you can handle
04:21:48.960 error states like that because Nex.js
04:21:51.040 offers this native uh error boundary.
04:21:54.399 the same way it actually offers a
04:21:55.760 loading boundary. But there is another
04:21:59.439 way of doing it and that is by using uh
04:22:02.640 react error
04:22:05.399 boundary dash legacy beer depths like
04:22:11.720 this. So in here what you can
04:22:15.239 do is inside of suspense add error
04:22:19.760 boundary. Make sure to not import it
04:22:22.000 yet.
04:22:24.800 And what you can do is copy this error
04:22:27.439 state from here. Go to agents view
04:22:29.520 export con agents view
04:22:32.920 error. Return the error state here.
04:22:36.479 Import the error
04:22:38.120 state like this. Keep them all together.
04:22:42.080 Go here in the
04:22:43.399 page. You will import error boundary
04:22:47.080 from react error
04:22:50.040 boundary like this.
04:22:54.199 and give it a fall back of agents view
04:23:00.080 error. So now you have all three
04:23:02.279 components from the same
04:23:05.479 place like this. And if you're wondering
04:23:08.239 why would I do this over native Nex.js
04:23:12.000 ones, well that's because native Nex.js
04:23:14.800 JS error boundary works on a entire page
04:23:18.640 level which in this specific case makes
04:23:21.439 sense but imagine you just wanted it on
04:23:24.880 a very small component in that page.
04:23:27.760 That's where having this kind of error
04:23:29.840 boundary makes more sense. So you can
04:23:32.880 now remove this
04:23:35.080 error.tsx and you can do a hard refresh
04:23:38.040 here and let me just see. So yeah, there
04:23:41.120 is one issue that might occasionally
04:23:45.040 happen, right? I don't know if you if
04:23:47.199 you've noticed it. So it eventually
04:23:49.279 showed this error, but uh it's very hard
04:23:52.399 to reproduce. For some of you, it might
04:23:54.720 happen. For some of you, it might not
04:23:56.319 happen. But keep your inspect element
04:23:58.600 open and make sure there we go. You can
04:24:01.439 see what's happening. So this is an
04:24:03.600 infinite loop that it was caught in. And
04:24:06.880 the only time I've noticed it happen is
04:24:09.520 either completely randomly or when you
04:24:12.960 throw an error, right? So, uh I'm not
04:24:17.840 sure if it happens with the native uh
04:24:21.760 error boundary from NextJS, but what I
04:24:24.479 do know, okay, let me just do a hard
04:24:26.720 refresh here
04:24:28.120 again. Yeah, you can see that when I
04:24:30.239 refresh, sometimes it happens, sometimes
04:24:32.319 it doesn't. So, it's not exactly
04:24:33.760 deterministic. And when I say hard
04:24:35.680 refresh, I mean command shift R or
04:24:39.359 basically this ignoring the cache. I
04:24:41.920 think you can do that in Chromium
04:24:43.840 browsers, right? Um it's something
04:24:47.840 relating with the hot reload. Uh I'm not
04:24:51.040 sure if it even translates to production
04:24:53.520 at all, but yeah, sometimes it can
04:24:55.600 happen. So if you get that, don't worry.
04:24:58.000 Uh I get it as well and other people do.
04:25:01.840 So there is an open issue on tanstack
04:25:04.399 query. Maximum update depth exceeded
04:25:06.720 here and uh it's very hard to track why
04:25:10.319 it's happening. You can see that uh
04:25:12.640 people are having trouble narrowing it
04:25:14.720 down. There is a specific version they
04:25:17.199 found. So if you want to completely get
04:25:20.239 rid of it, you could technically go
04:25:22.960 inside of the package JSON, find the
04:25:24.960 tanstack uh
04:25:28.439 query and downgrade, you know. Oops, not
04:25:31.680 this
04:25:32.680 one. Anstack React query, right? Find
04:25:36.479 this one. And you could technically, you
04:25:38.399 know, downgrade it to this version. And
04:25:40.399 apparently the issue does not happen
04:25:43.000 there. Uh because that's the last place
04:25:46.319 they uh did some actually it would
04:25:51.399 be 3. This would be the uh version
04:25:56.159 without any issues with infinite
04:25:58.159 hydration error loops, right?
04:26:01.199 if you if just for your information
04:26:03.680 because that's where they introduce some
04:26:05.520 hydration changes and then you can see a
04:26:07.600 bunch of you know discussion here uh I
04:26:10.399 think that even I left a comment here as
04:26:12.880 you can see that I encountered this
04:26:14.319 issue as well and when I use
04:26:17.159 5.66.3 the error actually goes away. Uh
04:26:21.199 the good news is they seem to be getting
04:26:23.920 to the bottom of it. As you can see just
04:26:26.000 yesterday, at least of the time I'm
04:26:27.680 recording this video, they seem to be
04:26:29.680 having a fix. So if you want to, you can
04:26:33.359 also follow this discussion. So uh just
04:26:36.960 please don't spam anything here, right?
04:26:39.359 They are doing their best to fix this.
04:26:41.920 It doesn't help anyone by commenting I
04:26:45.199 have the same problem, right? Unless you
04:26:47.359 have something of insight, no need to
04:26:49.760 spam the issue. They are obviously
04:26:51.439 fixing it. Um, so if you want to, you
04:26:54.239 can follow this issue along. Maximum
04:26:56.159 update depth exceeded in tan tech query.
04:26:59.520 And in here you can find the preview uh
04:27:03.760 pre-release packages which apparently
04:27:05.680 fixed the issue. I have not tested it
04:27:07.359 yet to confirm. So what you could do is
04:27:10.560 do npm install this add- legacy pure
04:27:13.439 deps and then you would have this type
04:27:15.359 of version inside. It's going to look
04:27:17.680 like this. So that's like a
04:27:20.199 pre-release. But basically I'm just
04:27:22.080 trying to tell you uh yeah I'm having
04:27:24.399 that maximum update depth error as well.
04:27:27.840 But I did not uh experience it breaking
04:27:30.880 my app in any way. Right. It doesn't
04:27:33.600 seem to freeze the entire app. It seems
04:27:35.359 to be somehow controlled. Another thing
04:27:38.239 you can keep an eye on is this issue
04:27:40.800 simply to see if it's closed. If it's
04:27:43.199 closed, it probably means that it might
04:27:45.439 be a good idea to check for a newer
04:27:48.479 version of React Query. Maybe that will
04:27:50.560 be 2, right? So, go ahead and do a
04:27:54.159 little bit of research if you're
04:27:55.359 interested and maybe they will fix it in
04:27:57.680 the next version. But nevertheless, I
04:28:00.159 developed with uh this version and I did
04:28:03.040 not find any big problems. It happened
04:28:06.080 very rarely mostly because we don't
04:28:08.080 really throw that many errors right you
04:28:10.800 can see that sometimes it happens
04:28:12.560 sometimes not but eventually it this
04:28:15.279 maximum update loop
04:28:17.720 ends and it shows the error. So yeah,
04:28:21.920 not sure exactly what's going on here,
04:28:24.640 but uh just to you know take some uh
04:28:27.760 your mind off ease, it's let's say quote
04:28:31.120 unquote normal, right? At least they are
04:28:33.359 on it. They know it's happening. So you
04:28:35.760 can now remove these two. You can remove
04:28:38.560 this and you can do a hard refresh just
04:28:41.760 to prove that it's still working. Uh and
04:28:44.720 I'm not sure if you noticed, but it is
04:28:46.640 significantly faster now. The loading is
04:28:49.439 much much quicker than it was when we
04:28:52.640 used the use query. Right? So a big
04:28:56.560 important thing here is if you're
04:28:59.439 planning on using suspense query in this
04:29:02.080 way, you need to make sure that in your
04:29:04.560 server component in your parent server
04:29:06.800 component you are doing the proper
04:29:08.560 prefetching here with the proper
04:29:10.720 hydration boundary because if you forget
04:29:13.439 to do these things you will end up with
04:29:16.319 some cryptic errors. So right now it is
04:29:18.680 working the reason it's working here uh
04:29:22.159 is because if it detects if use suspense
04:29:25.680 query detects no data right meaning
04:29:29.760 nothing was prefetched uh what will
04:29:32.239 happen is it will simply fall back to
04:29:35.199 use query but this will become a problem
04:29:38.640 with protected routes and you're going
04:29:41.040 to see that later when we actually
04:29:42.560 implement some protected routes so I
04:29:44.720 just showed you a bunch of options you
04:29:46.560 can fetch data in your project. A bunch
04:29:48.640 of ways you can show loading states, you
04:29:51.520 can show error states. We even use the
04:29:54.080 native uh Nex.js error boundary. So, I
04:29:57.199 hope that gave you a lot of new options
04:29:59.279 and uh the idea of how this works. And
04:30:02.880 as I said, you know, if you have a
04:30:04.800 preference for just using, you know, use
04:30:07.920 query and then handling loading an error
04:30:10.560 here, sure, no problem at all in doing
04:30:13.439 that. This is just an optimized way of
04:30:16.000 fetching your data. Uh it doesn't have
04:30:18.080 that much effect here because we just
04:30:20.159 have this simple data. But later when
04:30:22.560 you have actual data, it will definitely
04:30:25.199 you know uh you will see that it's
04:30:28.120 faster. Perfect. So I think that that
04:30:31.199 was everything I wanted to show you. We
04:30:32.880 have the agents modules, agent pages,
04:30:35.359 loading state and error state. And now
04:30:37.279 let's go ahead and create, review, and
04:30:38.800 merge this pull request. So 09 agents
04:30:42.840 setup.
04:30:44.439 So I'm going to go ahead and click on my
04:30:47.120 branch here. Create new branch. 09
04:30:52.279 agents
04:30:54.359 setup. Confirm you are in your new
04:30:56.760 branch. Add all changes
04:30:59.560 here. 09 agents
04:31:02.840 setup. Commit and publish the branch.
04:31:07.760 Now let's go ahead to our
04:31:10.279 GitHub. Let's open the pull
04:31:12.760 request. Let's create it and let's see
04:31:16.960 the review from Code
04:31:20.040 Rabbit. And here we have the summary. We
04:31:23.760 have introduced an agents dashboard page
04:31:26.560 with serverside data fetching, loading,
04:31:29.760 and error handling. We added reusable
04:31:32.159 loading and error state UI components.
04:31:34.880 And we have implemented an agents
04:31:36.720 database table to store agent
04:31:39.000 information. We have also enabled the
04:31:41.600 DRPC API endpoint for retrieving agent
04:31:45.399 data. Perfect. And we have added some
04:31:47.920 new dependencies nano ID and React error
04:31:51.279 boundary. Perfect. In here we have file
04:31:54.479 by file change summary. And in here we
04:31:57.520 have the sequence diagram. And these
04:31:59.520 will only become more useful uh the more
04:32:02.159 we use this type of prefetching, right?
04:32:04.159 because they will be helpful in
04:32:05.720 explaining why and how things are
04:32:08.880 happening. So let's go ahead and go over
04:32:10.800 them a little bit. So it starts with the
04:32:13.520 user visiting dashboard agents on the
04:32:16.080 agents page. The agents page is the
04:32:18.960 server component. In there we do a
04:32:21.600 prefetch to
04:32:23.560 agents.get many that in turn calls the
04:32:27.199 TRPC server which fetches all agents
04:32:30.239 from the database. It returns the agent
04:32:32.720 list to the TRPC server which we then
04:32:35.359 return to the TRPC client which finally
04:32:38.159 hydrates uh the agents page view with
04:32:42.560 the agent data and then we can render
04:32:45.920 that data finally. Here is the agent
04:32:48.239 view. My apologies. There we go.
04:32:50.960 Perfect. So it clearly shows how we are
04:32:53.720 prefetching through the parent server
04:32:57.080 component. And as per the comments here,
04:32:59.920 it only has comments regarding the fact
04:33:02.560 that this query is obviously not
04:33:04.879 something you would use in production.
04:33:06.958 And that's completely fair comment here,
04:33:10.561 but we will do that later when we
04:33:12.639 actually implement protected procedures
04:33:14.561 so that we can query by a specific user
04:33:17.118 and when we add pagination here. And
04:33:19.840 same thing for actually displaying those
04:33:22.080 elements. You can see in here they've
04:33:23.919 created an entire uh state uh for us
04:33:27.438 here. Perfect. So let's merge this pull
04:33:30.958 request. Let's confirm merge. And once
04:33:34.639 you've merged it, you can go ahead back
04:33:36.719 inside of your IDE. Select your main
04:33:39.480 branch and synchronize changes. Click
04:33:43.799 okay. Go inside of your source control
04:33:46.639 here. Open the graph and confirm that
04:33:48.799 you have just merged
04:33:50.599 09 agents setup. There we go. Perfect.
04:33:55.840 Amazing. Amazing job. And see you in the
04:33:59.840 next chapter.
04:34:03.520 In this chapter, I want to develop the
04:34:05.759 responsive dialogue component simply so
04:34:08.719 we save some time in the next chapter
04:34:11.680 where we are actually going to focus on
04:34:13.840 developing the new agent form and for
04:34:17.118 that we're going to need a responsive
04:34:19.520 dialogue. So I want to do a separate
04:34:22.480 chapter on that to also add a responsive
04:34:26.000 command dialogue while we are here.
04:34:29.759 So, as always, ensure that you're on
04:34:31.840 your main branch and ensure that you
04:34:34.240 have your changes synchronized. Also,
04:34:37.278 ensure that you have no active numbers
04:34:39.359 here in the source control. Perfect. So,
04:34:42.799 let's go ahead inside of the components
04:34:44.561 here and let's create the responsive
04:34:48.919 dialogue.
04:34:50.599 DSX like this. In here we are going to
04:34:54.480 import everything from components UI
04:34:57.480 dialogue and everything from components
04:35:00.719 UI
04:35:02.118 drawer. We are also going to import
04:35:04.561 everything from I mean one thing from
04:35:07.840 use is mobile from use mobile
04:35:10.599 hooks. And let's mark this as use client
04:35:14.240 here.
04:35:16.080 Now let's go ahead and let's write out
04:35:18.719 the
04:35:19.719 interface responsive dialogue props
04:35:22.799 title which is a required string
04:35:25.359 description which is a required string
04:35:27.759 children which are react react node open
04:35:30.799 which is a boolean and unopen change
04:35:32.879 which is a toggle for that
04:35:35.561 boolean let's export const responsive
04:35:38.719 dialogue
04:35:40.199 here let's go ahead and use these props
04:35:45.840 And let's go ahead and let's dstructure
04:35:48.639 all of them. So title, description,
04:35:50.958 children, open and on open
04:35:53.480 change. Let's define is mobile, use is
04:35:57.480 mobile. If is a mobile, we're going to
04:36:00.799 go ahead and return the drawer
04:36:06.118 component. Otherwise, we're going to
04:36:08.958 return the dialogue component.
04:36:14.759 So let's go ahead and do the following
04:36:18.320 thing. Let's add two of the same props
04:36:20.958 to it. Open will be
04:36:23.561 open and on open change will be on open
04:36:28.160 change
04:36:29.000 prop like
04:36:33.561 this. And now for the drawer let's add
04:36:37.278 drawer content here. Draw our
04:36:41.799 header drawer
04:36:44.438 title. Let's render the title. Below it
04:36:49.199 description, but let's change this
04:36:51.118 component to be drawer description.
04:36:54.480 Outside of the header, add a div with a
04:36:57.438 class name adding a
04:37:01.879 four and inside render the children.
04:37:07.278 Now for the dialogue, it's going to be
04:37:08.879 quite similar. Open up the dialogue
04:37:10.639 content here. Add the dialogue
04:37:14.039 header. Add the dialogue. Whoops.
04:37:18.199 Title, which will render the title. This
04:37:21.840 one will render the description, but
04:37:24.240 this one will be dialogue description
04:37:27.599 and fix the closing tag here. And one
04:37:30.320 thing we don't have to do is add a div.
04:37:33.118 So we can just add children here. That's
04:37:35.599 because while they are almost identical,
04:37:39.400 they briefly uh share they briefly uh
04:37:44.719 don't match in the body. So the footer,
04:37:47.759 I mean the drawer needs the padding
04:37:51.199 whereas the dialogue
04:37:53.958 doesn't. So now let's go ahead and test
04:37:56.480 this out. We can do it quite easily by
04:37:59.359 visiting any page that you want. For
04:38:01.320 example, let's do
04:38:03.958 agents. Uh, and let's go inside of
04:38:06.639 agents view. So, it needs to be a client
04:38:09.639 component. And inside of here, you can
04:38:11.840 just render the responsive
04:38:14.919 dialogue. Give it a title of responsive
04:38:19.359 test and a description of hello of
04:38:23.480 responsive description. And it needs the
04:38:26.799 children. So in here you could add like
04:38:29.359 a button component
04:38:31.680 uh some
04:38:34.118 action. So make sure you've imported
04:38:36.759 this hardcode open and for on open
04:38:40.958 change just do
04:38:42.840 this. There we
04:38:45.240 go. So now let's go ahead in the agents
04:38:49.879 here. And this is how it should look
04:38:52.561 like on desktop. You should not be able
04:38:54.561 to close it, right? because we hardcoded
04:38:57.520 it to be open. But if you switch to
04:39:01.599 mobile, it should open a drawer. So when
04:39:04.879 you refresh, there we go. It looks like
04:39:07.680 you can actually force close it on
04:39:10.000 mobile, but that's completely okay
04:39:11.359 because obviously we want our models to
04:39:14.000 be
04:39:14.840 closable. Uh, great. So that's it for
04:39:18.719 the responsive dialogue. So we can close
04:39:21.278 this now. You can remove it from here.
04:39:23.359 You no longer need it.
04:39:26.160 you can remove the associated
04:39:28.039 components. So what I want to do now is
04:39:30.879 I want to do the same thing for this
04:39:34.240 because right now this is what it looks
04:39:36.520 like. So let's make it responsive. And
04:39:39.840 the way I want to do this is just a
04:39:42.400 little bit
04:39:43.480 different. So I'm going to go inside of
04:39:46.160 source
04:39:47.400 components UI and I'm going to go
04:39:50.680 directly inside of the command
04:39:53.440 component. Right? Because when you go
04:39:56.320 inside of your dashboard command, that's
04:40:00.400 where you import from. So how
04:40:03.560 about we invent a new component inside?
04:40:07.280 So that's what chats allows us to do. We
04:40:10.798 are we should not be afraid of modifying
04:40:13.040 these components. They are not
04:40:15.440 maintained by some other author in your
04:40:18.718 node module. They are in your project.
04:40:21.440 You can go inside, you can change the
04:40:23.200 code and make it to your liking. So,
04:40:25.760 let's do exactly uh that. Go inside of
04:40:28.798 the command
04:40:30.360 here and find the command dialogue like
04:40:35.798 this. And let's go ahead and copy it
04:40:40.320 entirely and let's paste it below like
04:40:43.400 this. And let's rename it to command
04:40:47.240 responsive dialogue. The title can stay
04:40:50.240 the same and the description can stay
04:40:52.240 the same as well. Uh, and then what
04:40:54.958 we're going to do is the following.
04:40:57.040 We're going to add const is mobile, use
04:41:00.160 is
04:41:02.440 mobile from hooks use mobile,
04:41:05.480 right? And then if is mobile, we are
04:41:09.120 going to render, you guessed it, the
04:41:11.638 drawer. In order to do that, we need to
04:41:14.000 import everything from the drawer. So,
04:41:16.000 let's just add this. And let me just
04:41:18.000 move the hook up
04:41:20.040 here. There we go. Let's go to our
04:41:23.798 command responsive
04:41:26.360 dialogue like
04:41:30.280 that. So let's go ahead and render the
04:41:32.958 drawer component. And in here simply
04:41:36.000 spread all props the same way you're
04:41:38.000 doing for the dialogue. Now let's add
04:41:40.400 the drawer content.
04:41:42.958 And let's give it a class name
04:41:45.560 overflow hidden and padding of zero.
04:41:48.798 Inside of here, let's add a drawer
04:41:51.560 header. And let's give it a class name
04:41:55.200 SR only, which means screen reader
04:41:59.160 only. Let's add a title here. And render
04:42:02.560 the title. So this is only for
04:42:04.638 accessibility, right? This will not be
04:42:07.080 visible. Let's add a description
04:42:11.320 here. And let's just fix this by using
04:42:14.080 the proper drawer description
04:42:16.840 component. And then in here, what you
04:42:19.920 will
04:42:21.320 do is you will copy the
04:42:25.480 command and all of its
04:42:28.760 classes. Just like this. There we go.
04:42:33.520 And let's see. Now we have command
04:42:36.160 responsive dialogue and we have to
04:42:37.760 export it. So go all the way down
04:42:40.200 here and export it like this. And then
04:42:45.040 when you go inside of your dashboard
04:42:46.600 command, replace the import to use
04:42:49.440 command responsive dialogue. And instead
04:42:51.680 of using command dialogue, use command
04:42:54.638 responsive
04:42:55.798 dialogue. As simple as
04:43:00.120 that. So now when you try opening this
04:43:03.200 up, let me try zooming in a little bit.
04:43:06.638 When you try opening this up, it should
04:43:09.120 render in a
04:43:10.440 drawer. Looks like it's not rendering in
04:43:12.958 a drawer. Let's see
04:43:17.160 why. So, I have set it to be a command
04:43:20.718 responsive dialogue. I have set this to
04:43:23.840 be is
04:43:27.560 mobile. Oh, because I'm not using the
04:43:31.480 return. My apologies. Return.
04:43:35.040 That's why it never
04:43:38.600 returned. The reason you don't see any
04:43:40.958 errors for these kinds of things is
04:43:42.638 because it's technically correct syntax.
04:43:46.480 You don't have to return, right? It's
04:43:48.920 just never what you want, right? And
04:43:52.878 there we go. Now it's a nice draw. So
04:43:56.240 that's exactly what I wanted. Uh so it's
04:43:58.878 easier to use this global search on
04:44:01.560 mobile. Perfect. And on desktop it stays
04:44:05.200 a dialogue. Amazing. So there will be uh
04:44:09.360 we will be coming back to this component
04:44:12.000 later on when we actually implement the
04:44:14.240 functionality of this because maybe
04:44:17.280 you've already guessed but the way this
04:44:19.680 works right now is by using filters,
04:44:23.440 right? So it's not actually doing any
04:44:25.280 API calls here. It's simply filtering
04:44:28.718 whatever we put inside, right? So for
04:44:31.920 example, if I do test two here and if I
04:44:34.638 type two, it only filters test two.
04:44:38.080 That's not what we want because what we
04:44:40.160 want is to do an API request on each
04:44:43.240 keystroke, right? But we will worry
04:44:46.080 about that
04:44:47.958 later. Perfect. So I think this is a
04:44:51.520 great smaller chapter. So we fixed some
04:44:54.878 of those things. And just one more thing
04:44:58.160 that I kind of want to bring to your
04:45:00.200 attention. You might have noticed
04:45:03.160 that any of my buttons which are not
04:45:06.160 links don't have the cursor pointer.
04:45:09.920 Instead, they look not exactly
04:45:12.840 clickable. So that's a change in
04:45:15.360 Tailwind version 4, right? Only links
04:45:19.600 have the cursor pointer, but buttons
04:45:22.480 don't have it. If you want to change
04:45:25.680 that, there is a small snippet you can
04:45:28.480 do. So, what you have to do is go inside
04:45:30.878 of
04:45:32.120 your app folder globals and go all the
04:45:36.240 way down here and simply
04:45:39.400 add this another layer base. And
04:45:44.080 basically you will find all elements
04:45:46.320 which are either buttons which are not
04:45:49.160 disabled or are any other elements which
04:45:52.480 have a role of button and are not
04:45:54.600 disabled. And for them add a cursor
04:45:57.120 pointer. So just don't forget this
04:45:59.040 little comma here if you are writing
04:46:01.040 this out. Uh I found this snippet from
04:46:03.920 the actual Tailwind version 4
04:46:05.958 documentation. So this is what they
04:46:08.400 suggest if you want to reverse uh that
04:46:11.280 effect. So now buttons are clickable
04:46:14.520 again if you prefer it that way. If for
04:46:17.280 whatever reason you don't want it that
04:46:19.120 way just remove this. But you can see
04:46:22.480 that now this clearly indicates hey I
04:46:24.638 can click on this right and I can click
04:46:26.958 on this and click on this and on this. I
04:46:30.718 prefer it this way. Great. So I think
04:46:34.080 that wraps it up. We added the
04:46:35.920 responsive dialogue and responsive
04:46:37.840 command dialogue. Perfect. So now let's
04:46:40.798 create review and merge this pull
04:46:43.080 request. So I'm going to go ahead and go
04:46:47.040 inside of my source control just to
04:46:49.120 review. Okay, so I have four files
04:46:51.400 changed. I'm going to create a new
04:46:53.958 branch 10
04:46:56.120 responsive
04:46:58.840 dialogue. I'm going to stage all of my
04:47:02.798 changes. There we go. Add a commit
04:47:05.520 message. 10 responsive dialogues.
04:47:09.560 dialogue and let's commit and publish
04:47:12.718 the branch. There we go. Let's go to our
04:47:17.560 GitHub. Let's open a pull
04:47:20.360 request and let's get a review from our
04:47:24.718 AI
04:47:27.560 bot. So, let's go through our code
04:47:30.480 summary. We have introduced a responsive
04:47:32.958 dialogue component that adapts its
04:47:34.878 appearance for mobile and desktop
04:47:36.798 devices. We have also added a responsive
04:47:39.840 command plet dialogue that adjusts its
04:47:42.480 layout based on the device type. There
04:47:45.360 we go. We have also added one more
04:47:48.638 command option and we improved cursor
04:47:51.680 feedback for enabled buttons and
04:47:53.680 interactive elements ensuring a pointer
04:47:56.160 cursor is displayed for better user
04:47:58.320 experience. That's exactly the way I
04:48:00.000 feel about it. Right. Uh great. Great.
04:48:02.798 And in here we have a whole sequence
04:48:04.480 diagram explaining the device type
04:48:07.280 detection and how we display a drawer or
04:48:10.638 a dialogue depending on uh well device
04:48:14.920 type in here. It left uh some comments
04:48:18.160 here. Uh so this is pretty cool. It
04:48:21.200 noticed the inconsistent padding between
04:48:23.440 mobile and desktop implementation in the
04:48:25.520 responsive dialogue component. Right? Do
04:48:27.440 you remember that? And we know that
04:48:30.958 that's okay.
04:48:32.718 Right? We know because drawer content
04:48:36.480 behaves differently than dialogue
04:48:38.878 content. So I told you that we need to
04:48:40.718 add padding for the drawer. But uh code
04:48:44.320 rabbit, you know, the AI can't really
04:48:46.400 know that the same way you probably
04:48:48.160 didn't know it, right? So it made a cons
04:48:51.520 uh a consideration for us here to remove
04:48:54.400 that to make it the same as for the
04:48:57.200 dialogue. But since we know that's not
04:48:59.520 the case, we can safely resolve this
04:49:02.240 conversation. But pretty good catch by
04:49:04.920 AI. Obviously, all of the command items
04:49:08.000 in the dashboard command are currently
04:49:10.638 just for test. So, no need to do that.
04:49:12.958 And this is interesting. So, it noticed
04:49:15.200 props type
04:49:16.680 inconsistency. Specifically, it noticed
04:49:19.200 it in the
04:49:22.120 command component. This one command
04:49:25.120 responsive dialogue. So in here we share
04:49:28.718 the component props type of dialogue and
04:49:32.718 then we use those
04:49:34.920 props to spread them to the
04:49:38.200 drawer. So yeah, this is a pretty good
04:49:41.120 catch because nothing is really ensuring
04:49:43.680 to us that these props will be
04:49:47.000 compatible or at least compatible
04:49:49.200 forever. But in this case, you know, the
04:49:51.600 draw, you already noticed that the
04:49:53.360 drawer component and the dialogue
04:49:55.120 component behave pretty much the same
04:49:57.120 and I'm pretty sure have the exact same
04:50:00.040 API. So that's open, default, open,
04:50:03.040 open, unopen, change, and model. All of
04:50:05.520 those are supported in the drawer. So we
04:50:09.360 don't have to add any explicit props
04:50:11.600 here. So it's very good that it noticed
04:50:14.320 that because I definitely didn't even
04:50:17.200 think of that, right? So you can see the
04:50:19.680 kinds of things uh it it suggests you to
04:50:24.120 refactor. So yeah, in case you're using
04:50:26.958 some newer version of Shaden and you're
04:50:29.040 having problems here, it might be
04:50:31.120 because of that. It might be because the
04:50:32.878 dialogue and the drawer components API
04:50:34.878 have diverged and they are no longer in
04:50:37.520 sync. But in my version of SHAT CN, uh
04:50:40.958 these components are exactly the same.
04:50:44.560 these props have the exact same uh API.
04:50:48.638 So I will resolve this conversation as
04:50:50.560 well and I'm going to merge this full
04:50:53.600 request. There we go. Once we've done
04:50:56.160 that, we can go ahead back inside of our
04:50:58.240 main branch and we can click this little
04:51:01.840 button here to synchronize the changes.
04:51:04.160 Let's click
04:51:05.400 okay. And that should bring back
04:51:08.798 everything. There we go. Amazing.
04:51:11.760 Amazing job. Confirm with your source
04:51:14.560 control graph here that everything's
04:51:16.480 okay. We just merged number 10
04:51:18.798 responsive dialogue. Amazing. See you in
04:51:22.240 the next
04:51:24.760 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
04:51:27.440 go ahead and develop the agents form.
04:51:30.718 This will include creating a list header
04:51:33.240 component which is going to render the
04:51:36.400 my agents text and the new agent button.
04:51:41.440 Once we press on that button, we're
04:51:43.280 going to use previously created
04:51:45.200 responsive dialogue and render the agent
04:51:48.240 form
04:51:50.440 inside. In order to achieve all of that,
04:51:53.680 we're going to have to implement a
04:51:55.600 protected procedure, agents.create
04:51:58.600 procedure, the list header component,
04:52:01.440 the new agent dialogue, and the actual
04:52:04.560 agent form. And this agent form will be
04:52:07.840 reusable for both create and update
04:52:11.160 actions. So let's go ahead and start
04:52:14.000 with protected procedure. So right now
04:52:17.440 if you go inside of source
04:52:19.320 DRPC in it all you have is a base
04:52:24.120 procedure and for example in your
04:52:27.280 modules agents server procedures for get
04:52:32.160 many we use a base procedure. This is
04:52:35.520 the equivalent of an API request which
04:52:38.718 has absolutely no security at all in
04:52:42.240 sense of protecting the authorized
04:52:44.958 route. So that's what we're going to do
04:52:47.360 in this chapter. We're going to create a
04:52:50.240 protected procedure. So before you start
04:52:53.440 doing that, as always, ensure that
04:52:55.440 you're on your default branch and feel
04:52:57.840 free to click synchronize changes just
04:53:00.480 in case something was left over. Go
04:53:03.200 ahead and mpm rundev your app. And now
04:53:07.120 we're going to borrow the way we
04:53:09.600 protected our dashboard page. TSX using
04:53:13.520 the session like this. So you can copy
04:53:16.000 this right here and go inside of tRPC in
04:53:20.680 it. Now in here we're going to export
04:53:24.160 const protected procedure and we are
04:53:27.520 going to extend on top of base
04:53:29.920 procedure.
04:53:31.600 Technically, you could also do
04:53:33.320 t.procedure because that's exactly what
04:53:35.600 base procedure is. But just
04:53:37.200 semantically, it makes more sense that
04:53:39.680 our protected procedure is based on top
04:53:42.878 of a base procedure. Now, obviously, if
04:53:46.080 later on you modify your base procedure
04:53:48.320 to do something specific for, you know,
04:53:50.638 public routes, you wouldn't want to uh
04:53:53.840 build the protected procedure on top of
04:53:56.320 that, right? But for this kind of uh
04:54:00.400 arrangement it makes sense. So base
04:54:04.160 procedure dot use async and extract
04:54:08.638 context and next. So this is a kind of
04:54:12.520 middleware. And now we're just going to
04:54:15.360 paste the session
04:54:17.878 await from out which we have to import
04:54:21.280 from lib out. So make sure you've added
04:54:23.200 this import and import the headers.
04:54:27.280 from next
04:54:29.000 headers. And now we have our session
04:54:32.000 using the server side out adapter from
04:54:34.718 better out. And what we're going to do
04:54:37.280 is check if there is no
04:54:39.320 session. Throw new TRPC error
04:54:44.440 here. Make sure you import TRPC error
04:54:47.200 from at TRPC
04:54:49.560 server.
04:54:51.400 Code unauthorized.
04:54:54.120 message unauthorized or whatever you
04:54:57.360 want to throw and the
04:55:00.920 important throw back next and extend the
04:55:05.360 context. So we're going to spread the
04:55:07.120 existing context and under key out we
04:55:10.878 are going to store the current session.
04:55:13.280 So now after this validation passes we
04:55:16.798 will have access to the currently logged
04:55:18.958 in user information in all of our future
04:55:21.680 procedures. So now we have the protected
04:55:24.400 procedure here. So let's go ahead now
04:55:28.718 and do the following. Let's go inside of
04:55:30.560 modules agents server procedures. Leave
04:55:33.920 this as base procedure for now. So I'm
04:55:36.638 going to add a little to-do change get
04:55:40.760 many to use uh protected procedure you
04:55:46.638 know just in case we forget. But for now
04:55:49.120 just leave it like this. Instead, let's
04:55:51.080 create the create procedure using the
04:55:55.480 protected procedure. So, make sure you
04:55:57.760 import this. Great. Now, inside of here,
04:56:02.160 we're going to add an input. And inside
04:56:04.798 of the input, we're going to add the
04:56:07.280 schema for create. So, let's go ahead
04:56:10.958 and do this. Inside of the agents
04:56:12.638 module, create a new file called
04:56:14.560 schemas.ts.
04:56:18.958 So it's like this. It's not specifically
04:56:21.200 in the server folder nor the UI folder.
04:56:23.920 It's schemas for itself in the agents
04:56:26.360 folder. In here, import Z from zod
04:56:31.600 export con agents insert schema Z object
04:56:36.920 name string with a minimum value of one
04:56:41.280 and a message name is
04:56:44.520 required. And the same thing for
04:56:47.040 instructions.
04:56:49.760 like this and now let's pass in the
04:56:53.200 agents insert schema here. So the reason
04:56:55.600 I have done it in a separate file is
04:56:58.638 very simple so I can later reuse it for
04:57:03.200 the form. Great. So protected
04:57:07.320 procedure.input and then let's chain dot
04:57:10.240 mutation because this is not a query.
04:57:12.400 This is a mutation. So in here we grab
04:57:15.040 async again and we can export uh my
04:57:17.840 apologies. We can destruct input and the
04:57:20.958 context from here.
04:57:24.240 So what is what in the input we can grab
04:57:29.638 things like our name and instructions
04:57:33.280 basically the things that will uh be
04:57:36.000 added through a form but from the
04:57:39.798 context we can now
04:57:42.040 destructure out and out will hold our
04:57:46.718 session our user ID and our user
04:57:50.000 information. You can see even some more
04:57:52.160 useful things here.
04:57:54.000 So that's what these two hold. So let's
04:57:57.920 go ahead and do the following const data
04:58:01.440 or we can do this. We can do you can
04:58:03.600 immediately destructure the array and go
04:58:07.520 ahead and write created agent to be
04:58:10.958 await database. You already have it
04:58:13.440 imported because we used it here. So
04:58:16.080 database.insert insert into agents
04:58:19.638 schema
04:58:21.240 values and in here spread the input and
04:58:26.160 attach user ID from context out user
04:58:31.798 ID and make sure to chain returning.
04:58:36.000 There we go. So now when you hover over
04:58:37.680 created agent you will see that that
04:58:39.360 will be a new created agent. If you
04:58:41.440 forgot to add returning, then it's just
04:58:44.638 a type of any because it's not returning
04:58:46.958 anything. If you're wondering why do we
04:58:49.200 need to do it inside of an array like
04:58:51.040 this? Why not just like this? That's
04:58:53.280 because by default, Drizzle always
04:58:55.760 returns an array because that's the way
04:58:58.638 SQL natively works, right? So that's why
04:59:01.840 we have to dstructure the first item in
04:59:04.160 this array because we know that even
04:59:06.560 though this is an array, we are only
04:59:09.200 creating a single record. So it's safe
04:59:11.760 for us to simply access the first item
04:59:14.560 in this array immediately in here
04:59:17.440 calling it created
04:59:19.958 agent. And once you've obtained the
04:59:22.240 created agent, you can simply return the
04:59:24.160 created agent. And what's cool is that
04:59:27.280 this is a fully uh validated and
04:59:31.000 alprotected procedure now. Even though
04:59:34.080 we didn't explicitly write any checks
04:59:36.480 here, so if the user forgets to pass
04:59:39.440 instructions or the name for the agent,
04:59:42.400 this will cause the procedure to fail.
04:59:45.280 And if the user is not logged in, this
04:59:48.400 the protected procedure will cause it to
04:59:51.440 fail. So that's how we have abstracted
04:59:54.878 that into our safe API safe
04:59:58.600 procedure. Perfect. Now let's go ahead
05:00:02.080 and create our list header component. So
05:00:06.400 let me just go to our app here. Make
05:00:08.560 sure you have your app running of course
05:00:10.560 and let's go inside of agents. So we are
05:00:12.560 on the same page here. And in here,
05:00:15.280 let's go inside of source app
05:00:18.520 folder dashboard agents page. And now
05:00:23.040 what we're going to do is the following.
05:00:25.360 So you might think that we will put the
05:00:28.480 list header component which is this the
05:00:32.560 text my agents and the new agent button
05:00:35.280 inside of the agents view. Right? Maybe
05:00:37.280 add it above this. We are not going to
05:00:40.400 do that because it makes no sense for
05:00:43.600 that part to be shown an error or for
05:00:47.040 that part to be loading. That part never
05:00:50.638 needs to load. It's static. Right? We
05:00:53.520 are not loading the agent name. It's
05:00:55.520 just a hard-coded text my agents. So
05:00:58.638 what we can do is inside of this server
05:01:01.638 component, we can simply render some
05:01:04.320 things outside of this hydration
05:01:06.000 boundary here. for example, list header
05:01:09.040 like
05:01:09.878 this. And now we are going to go ahead
05:01:13.200 inside of modules agents UI and create a
05:01:17.280 new folder called components just so we
05:01:19.600 semantically differentiate between the
05:01:21.440 two. And let's call this one list
05:01:24.840 header.tsx. If you want to, you can call
05:01:26.638 it agents list header if you want to be
05:01:29.120 more specific. Let's export const agents
05:01:32.560 list
05:01:34.360 header like this.
05:01:38.878 Let's just call it list
05:01:41.160 header. And in here, import agents list
05:01:44.320 header from modules agents UI components
05:01:47.120 agents list header. So now you will see
05:01:51.280 that this list header is automatically
05:01:53.440 displayed regardless of this being in
05:01:56.160 the loading state. And that's exactly
05:01:58.080 how I wanted it to behave, right?
05:02:00.240 There's no point in hiding this while
05:02:02.240 it's
05:02:03.080 loading. Perfect. So now let's work
05:02:05.680 inside of the agents list header here.
05:02:09.200 And let's give this div a class
05:02:11.718 name of
05:02:13.718 py4
05:02:17.718 px4 and let's do
05:02:21.480 mdpx8 flex flex column and gap y of
05:02:26.360 four. Now inside of here add another div
05:02:29.280 with a class name flex item center and
05:02:32.000 justify between
05:02:34.958 And in the first element here which is
05:02:37.760 the heading five write my agents. And
05:02:41.840 then below it add a button from
05:02:44.400 components UI button with the text new
05:02:47.320 agent. So make sure you've added this
05:02:49.600 import here. Uh and also yeah mark this
05:02:52.560 as use
05:02:54.840 client because by default uh if you just
05:02:59.440 put a new component inside of a server
05:03:01.680 component it will be a server component
05:03:04.360 until either the parent has used client
05:03:07.600 or the component itself has used
05:03:10.600 client and uh I have to explain this
05:03:14.080 just in case you got confused. Now, so
05:03:16.798 if you were to mark this as use client,
05:03:19.920 then yes, every single ch child inside
05:03:23.120 of here would automatically become a
05:03:25.120 client component as well. But that can
05:03:28.958 be uh overridden if you used children
05:03:33.360 for example. So if you inject children
05:03:35.840 into a use client component,
05:03:40.360 whoops, then everything will become a
05:03:43.360 client component besides the children.
05:03:45.680 Children act like kind of a portal
05:03:48.000 outside of it. Right? So I just needed
05:03:50.000 to explain that just in case uh you
05:03:52.958 jumped to some conclusions because I
05:03:54.718 often get comments asking about that. Uh
05:03:57.920 I will try to find a better example
05:04:00.000 because this wasn't exactly the best way
05:04:02.560 to show it. So yeah, just make sure you
05:04:04.400 didn't change anything in this uh agents
05:04:07.360 page besides adding the agents list
05:04:09.440 header here. And now let's see how this
05:04:12.240 looks like. There we go. The text my
05:04:13.840 agents and the new agent button. So now
05:04:16.878 what I want to do is I want to give this
05:04:18.798 H5 element a class name of font
05:04:24.120 medium and text extra large. There we
05:04:27.920 go. My agents new agent. And for this
05:04:30.798 button, let's add it a plus icon
05:04:33.878 here from Lucid
05:04:36.920 React and give the plus icon a class
05:04:39.840 name. Actually, I don't think you need
05:04:41.920 to do anything. It will automatically
05:04:44.160 have the proper class name. There we go.
05:04:46.638 Great. So now, uh, what we have to do is
05:04:51.920 we have to enable a dialogue to open
05:04:54.958 when we click on the new agent. So for
05:04:58.000 that we're going to go inside of this
05:05:00.240 agents modules agents UI components and
05:05:03.120 we're going to create uh new agent
05:05:07.240 dialogue
05:05:09.080 tsx and in here import our previously
05:05:13.040 created responsive dialogue from
05:05:15.520 components responsive dialogue create an
05:05:18.400 interface new dialogue new agent
05:05:21.920 dialogue props open boolean on open
05:05:28.120 change a simple toggle for
05:05:31.320 that and export con new agent
05:05:35.320 dialogue. Let's go ahead and assign the
05:05:37.680 props here and destructure
05:05:40.760 them open on open
05:05:44.040 change and in here return the responsive
05:05:47.680 dialogue like this. Let's give it a
05:05:51.000 title. New agent, a description, create
05:05:55.440 a new
05:05:58.120 agent. Open and on open
05:06:02.600 change. And inside of here, you can just
05:06:05.280 write new agent
05:06:08.600 form. There we go. So, we now have the
05:06:10.958 new agent dialogue. So, we can now go
05:06:13.120 back inside of the agents list header,
05:06:15.840 encapsulate this entire component in a
05:06:18.320 fragment. So we are semantically correct
05:06:20.240 with the positioning of our new agent
05:06:22.798 dialogue. Even though it uses a portal,
05:06:25.680 right? So uh it doesn't really matter
05:06:28.000 where you put it, but I like to be
05:06:29.440 semantically correct. Now in here, let's
05:06:32.798 add is dialogue open and set is dialogue
05:06:37.600 open to be use state from React with
05:06:40.718 default false. Let me just align these
05:06:44.798 imports like I like them to. Let's set
05:06:48.320 the open here to be is dialogue open and
05:06:51.520 on open change to be set is dialogue
05:06:54.440 open and modify the button on click here
05:06:58.718 to modify set is dialogue open to true.
05:07:02.718 There we go. So now when you click new
05:07:04.958 agent you get the new agent dialogue and
05:07:07.840 in case you are on mobile you will get a
05:07:10.958 draw. So exactly as we've developed in
05:07:13.680 the previous chapter. Perfect. So what
05:07:16.958 we have to do now is develop the actual
05:07:20.638 uh new agent form which will be
05:07:23.280 compatible uh both for updating and for
05:07:28.400 creating the
05:07:29.878 agents. So let's go inside of components
05:07:32.400 here. So modules agents UI components
05:07:35.638 agent dash form. It's unspecified
05:07:39.360 whether it's a new agent form or update
05:07:41.520 agent form because it's one form to rule
05:07:43.840 them all. So in here let's create an
05:07:46.320 interface agent on props and inside of
05:07:50.878 here we're going to get on
05:07:52.840 success to be an optional type of call
05:07:56.240 back right same as on cancel. So these
05:07:59.280 are not won't be required but uh it's
05:08:02.240 good to have them in case you want to
05:08:03.920 redirect the user after a success or if
05:08:06.718 they cancel right and then we need the
05:08:09.040 optional initial values right but uh
05:08:13.760 right now we have no idea
05:08:17.360 uh what the type of the initial values
05:08:19.798 is. So, how about we create this? And
05:08:24.160 the way we can do this, the way I like
05:08:27.200 to do this is not by reading what's
05:08:30.878 inside of my schema. That's one way of
05:08:33.120 doing it. We could infer this from
05:08:35.000 Drizzle, but what I like to do is I like
05:08:38.480 to know exactly what my
05:08:42.120 procedure returns back. So, that's the
05:08:45.680 way I like to do it. So, this is what
05:08:48.240 we're going to do. Let's quickly uh
05:08:51.600 create a get one
05:08:54.760 procedure. So get one and the reason
05:08:58.878 that I'm doing this is simply because
05:09:02.638 when the user goes about updating the
05:09:05.040 agent, they will first have to fetch
05:09:08.320 that individual agent. So that will be
05:09:10.798 done using the get one procedure. So
05:09:13.840 let's uh also keep this as base
05:09:16.638 procedure for now. It really doesn't
05:09:18.080 matter. Let's just add two comments
05:09:20.000 here. So change get one to use protected
05:09:22.400 procedure. So let's just add uh base
05:09:26.080 procedure here. It's okay. And let's add
05:09:28.480 the input here to be Z.object. And I
05:09:31.680 think we need to import Z here. So
05:09:34.240 import Z from Zod like this. And in here
05:09:38.718 just set the ID to be a type of string.
05:09:40.958 We are basically fetching the individual
05:09:44.240 agent using ID. So select from agents
05:09:48.000 where and then add equals from drizzle
05:09:51.280 or like
05:09:54.520 this. And all you're going to check is
05:09:57.680 whether agents do ID equals input do ID
05:10:02.080 and you have to destructure the input
05:10:04.080 from here. And then you can use it
05:10:07.400 here. And then in here you can
05:10:09.840 destructure the individual existing
05:10:12.400 agent like this and return it. So when I
05:10:16.718 hover over this you will see that it's
05:10:18.560 the correct type. So this is the initial
05:10:22.080 values that the update form will be
05:10:24.878 populated with. That's why I wanted to
05:10:27.200 create this right here. So make sure
05:10:31.440 that you have added this. So it's just a
05:10:33.280 very simple temporary form. We are going
05:10:35.520 to change it to protected procedure
05:10:37.120 later. We will do the whole proper
05:10:38.798 thing. Let's just leave it like this for
05:10:40.400 now. And let's go inside of agents and
05:10:43.040 let's create
05:10:45.080 types.ts. And we are not going to type
05:10:48.080 any types. We are just going to infer
05:10:50.320 them here. So import infer router
05:10:53.280 outputs from at
05:10:55.878 gRPC/server and go ahead and
05:10:59.080 import type app
05:11:01.958 router from atward
05:11:05.878 slashtrpc
05:11:07.560 routouters_app. So it's basically this
05:11:09.760 export right here in our tRPC
05:11:12.360 routers_app folder. So this app router
05:11:15.840 now has access to the entire agent's
05:11:18.000 router including the get one procedure.
05:11:20.638 So what I can do now is export type
05:11:23.200 agent get one and make it infer router
05:11:27.240 outputs pass in the app router. So it
05:11:30.000 has the context target the agents
05:11:32.760 specifically the get one procedure. So
05:11:35.760 now when I hover over this this is the
05:11:38.798 type that I am returning in this get one
05:11:41.718 procedure. So now we have this reusable
05:11:44.798 get one type which is correctly inferred
05:11:49.360 as our API will return it right because
05:11:53.440 you might think oh it would be much
05:11:55.280 shorter if I just inferred it from the
05:11:57.760 database schema well true but what if we
05:12:01.120 change our get one base procedure and we
05:12:03.600 only select the name for example right
05:12:06.400 and we don't select anything else then
05:12:09.440 your schema will not be correct right so
05:12:12.080 that's why I like to uh know exactly
05:12:14.798 what my API returns. So right now, for
05:12:17.120 example, let's try and do this. I'm I'm
05:12:18.958 not sure if I'm doing it correctly. Uh
05:12:21.680 but let's say I use name agents.name. Is
05:12:24.878 this how I do it? And now when I hover
05:12:27.280 over this, you can see that it only
05:12:29.280 returns the name, right? So that's why I
05:12:31.840 think it's important to use the return
05:12:35.280 of your API rather than your schema here
05:12:38.958 because this is what defines what will
05:12:42.080 the initial values be. So now we have
05:12:44.480 that in here. I just removed that select
05:12:46.560 you do it as well. Okay. So we just did
05:12:49.280 a small detour here. Now let's go back
05:12:51.440 inside of UI components agent form and
05:12:54.320 we can now set the agent get one from
05:12:57.760 our types here. And now we know what our
05:13:00.798 initial values will be. Now let's export
05:13:03.920 con agent
05:13:06.440 form. And in here let's add agent form
05:13:10.000 props. And let's dstructure on success
05:13:13.120 on cancel and initial
05:13:15.638 values. Let's prepare TRPC from use TRPC
05:13:19.760 here. Let's prepare router from use
05:13:22.480 router from next navigation. And let's
05:13:25.280 import query client from use query
05:13:29.120 client from tanstack react query. My
05:13:31.520 apologies. Uh oops. No, no, no. This is
05:13:33.600 incorrect. Use query
05:13:36.040 client. There we go. No need for this.
05:13:40.240 So
05:13:41.240 use router from next navigation. Use
05:13:44.638 query client from 10stack react query.
05:13:46.798 Use tRPC from ad/trpc client and agent
05:13:50.400 get one from the types. Great. Now let's
05:13:54.400 go ahead and create our create agent
05:13:58.400 method using use
05:14:00.440 mutation from tanstack react query and
05:14:04.560 in here simply pass the TRPC agents
05:14:09.840 create and pass in the mutation options
05:14:13.240 here and in the mutation options define
05:14:16.480 on success method here for now to be
05:14:19.760 empty and on error to be empty as But
05:14:23.440 we're going to come back to this uh
05:14:26.520 later. Great. So now that we have this
05:14:31.280 uh let's go ahead and create our form
05:14:35.200 here. So const form will be use form
05:14:38.958 from React hook
05:14:41.560 form and we're going to Z.infer. And in
05:14:45.280 order to do this we need to
05:14:47.000 import Z from zod. So Z.info info and we
05:14:53.200 don't have to write any new schema. We
05:14:54.958 can just do a type of agents insert
05:14:58.280 schema. Do you remember this? We've
05:15:01.360 created this previously just a moment
05:15:03.280 ago when we used it inside of our create
05:15:06.638 procedure agents insert schema. It's
05:15:09.200 located inside of our modules agents
05:15:12.958 schemas. It's right here. So I just
05:15:15.520 import that again and then I can use it
05:15:18.240 here and I don't have to write any new
05:15:20.600 schemas. I can then add my resolvers zod
05:15:23.600 resolver from hook form resolvers zod
05:15:26.480 and pass the agents insert
05:15:29.160 schema and add my default
05:15:31.958 values which are name and
05:15:35.240 instructions. So make sure that you have
05:15:37.680 imported the ZOD resolver
05:15:40.120 here and then make sure that you
05:15:42.878 properly assign default values right
05:15:45.280 because this is true for a new form but
05:15:47.840 if we actually have initial values we
05:15:50.000 should fill them. So go ahead and check
05:15:52.878 if you have initial
05:15:55.080 values and then depending on if we are
05:15:58.760 intame or an empty string or if we are
05:16:01.520 in dot instructions or an empty string.
05:16:04.160 So this way it's going to populate or
05:16:06.718 fall back to an empty
05:16:08.840 string. Great. So we now have the form.
05:16:11.520 Now let's create a useful isedit method
05:16:14.240 here which will be simply be a double
05:16:17.120 exclamation point initial values
05:16:20.400 question mark id. So this is what we're
05:16:23.440 going to use to determine whether this
05:16:25.120 is editing form or creating form. And
05:16:28.798 let's define const is pending here to be
05:16:32.080 create agent is pending. The reason I'm
05:16:34.560 adding it in a separate variable is
05:16:36.878 because later we're going to have update
05:16:39.400 agent is pending. So right now this does
05:16:42.560 not exist. So that's why it's an error.
05:16:44.718 But let's already be prepared for this
05:16:46.878 to be uh extended later on. Perfect. So
05:16:51.280 now let's do con onsubmit method here
05:16:54.718 which gets the value z infer type of
05:16:58.798 insert agent
05:17:00.520 schema. agents insert schema. My
05:17:03.958 apologies. Uh and if is
05:17:07.878 edit, we're just going to do console log
05:17:11.200 to do uh update agent. Else we are going
05:17:15.600 to do create
05:17:17.638 agent.mmutate and pass in the
05:17:20.120 values like this. There we
05:17:22.760 go. Perfect. So now what we have to do
05:17:26.000 is we have to import everything from our
05:17:29.280 form
05:17:31.080 control I mean from our add/components
05:17:34.958 UI form. So form form control field item
05:17:38.878 label and message. Besides that we're
05:17:41.600 also going to use our generated avatar
05:17:44.560 component which we have already used in
05:17:47.360 our dashboard user button in case the
05:17:49.520 user doesn't have an image.
05:17:52.080 And we're going to add text area. I
05:17:54.480 think this is the first time using this
05:17:56.040 component. Uh it's just a text area in
05:17:59.760 your source components UI text area
05:18:02.400 added from chats and UI. And besides
05:18:05.120 that, we're also going to need the usual
05:18:07.840 input from components UI input and
05:18:10.000 button from components UI uh button. And
05:18:13.840 I think for now that's all the imports
05:18:17.360 we need. Let's go ahead and develop this
05:18:19.120 form now. So after on submit, let's
05:18:22.000 finally do a return here and open up a
05:18:24.718 form. Go ahead and spread the form from
05:18:28.320 use form here. Inside of here, add a
05:18:31.680 native HTML form element. Give it a
05:18:34.400 class name of space y4 and give it an
05:18:37.680 onsubmit of form handle submit and pass
05:18:40.638 in the onsubmit function. In case you're
05:18:43.280 wondering why am I doing a function
05:18:45.440 inside of a function uh form handle
05:18:48.798 submit basically ensures that uh we
05:18:52.400 didn't do anything wrong in regards to
05:18:55.680 the schema right so this part will
05:19:00.520 prevent this from being called which is
05:19:03.680 the actual submit method if the form is
05:19:06.638 not correct if it's too short right if
05:19:09.600 there are any HTML errors being thrown
05:19:12.360 phone. So now inside of here, let's add
05:19:14.878 a generated avatar component here. And
05:19:18.160 we're going to give the seed to be
05:19:20.520 form.watch name. So every time you
05:19:22.798 change the name of this agent, a new
05:19:24.798 avatar will be generated according to
05:19:27.360 that name. The variant will be uh bots
05:19:31.440 neutral. Let me just select it. There we
05:19:34.080 go. And class name will be border and
05:19:38.600 size 16. There we go. Now let's add a
05:19:42.320 form field which is a self-closing tag.
05:19:44.638 Let's give it a name of name and let's
05:19:47.120 give it a control of form.cont control
05:19:50.000 and then finally a render method. In
05:19:52.798 here we can immediately dstructure the
05:19:55.638 field. Let's add form item here form
05:19:59.760 label which will be the
05:20:01.718 name. Let's add form control here. And
05:20:05.200 let's render the input. And let's simply
05:20:08.400 spread the field here. So, let's go
05:20:11.280 ahead and check it out. Uh, let me just
05:20:14.400 see. Okay, these errors are fine. These
05:20:16.480 are just unused values. I think what I
05:20:19.200 have to do now is go inside of my new
05:20:21.440 agent dialogue right here and actually
05:20:25.360 render the agent
05:20:28.040 form from dot / agent form. Now in here
05:20:34.400 uh what I want to pass is on success on
05:20:38.320 open change false and on cancel too. So
05:20:42.638 basically once we complete the form and
05:20:45.360 once we or if we cancel the form just
05:20:49.120 close the responsive dialogue. So that's
05:20:51.280 what we want in the call back. So now if
05:20:53.600 you click here you should see this
05:20:56.798 right. How you name your agent will
05:20:59.760 depend on the avatar that will be
05:21:01.680 generated. And I think that's pretty
05:21:03.520 cool because this way we have consistent
05:21:05.760 avatars for an agent, right? If you name
05:21:07.840 it John, it will have this avatar
05:21:10.480 everywhere because we're always going to
05:21:12.240 use the agent name as the
05:21:14.920 seed. Perfect. So now let's go ahead and
05:21:19.680 uh let me just see one thing. Yeah, this
05:21:21.840 doesn't have a placeholder. So if you
05:21:23.360 want to, you can add a placeholder here.
05:21:29.440 for example, John, right? Or I don't
05:21:32.400 know, maybe something like math
05:21:35.240 tutor,
05:21:37.000 right? Uh now what we're going to do is
05:21:39.680 we're going to copy this entire form
05:21:41.440 field and we're going to use a
05:21:45.000 instructions here. This will be
05:21:47.718 instructions and instead of using the
05:21:49.840 input, we will use a text area. Right?
05:21:53.520 And in the placeholder here, you can
05:21:55.920 add, you know, whatever you want to
05:21:59.040 explain to your users what it is. So,
05:22:01.920 for example, it can be, let me just
05:22:05.200 paste it. You are a helpful, let's do
05:22:08.718 math assistant that can answer questions
05:22:10.878 and help with
05:22:16.920 assignments like this, right? Whatever
05:22:19.600 you want to add inside. There we go.
05:22:23.080 Perfect. And then what we need is
05:22:28.200 after still inside of the form, right?
05:22:30.798 But after the form control here, add a
05:22:37.560 div and inside check if we have on
05:22:41.320 cancel. If we do, render a button and
05:22:45.760 the text
05:22:47.240 cancel. Give it a variant of ghost.
05:22:51.520 disabled of is
05:22:53.878 pending and type of button. This is very
05:22:57.280 important otherwise it will submit the
05:22:59.840 form because it's still inside of the
05:23:01.840 form
05:23:02.840 here and on click here will be a very
05:23:06.240 simple on
05:23:09.638 cancel and then you can add another
05:23:12.638 button
05:23:14.040 here. loading actually disabled here
05:23:17.200 will be is pending as
05:23:19.638 well and give it a type of
05:23:23.320 submit. Check if it's edit and then
05:23:26.080 render update otherwise render create.
05:23:30.000 There we
05:23:31.080 go. Perfect. So now you have cancel and
05:23:34.958 create here. And let's just use this div
05:23:38.320 to give it a flex justify between and
05:23:41.040 gap x of two. There we go. So now when I
05:23:44.560 click cancel here I can close this and
05:23:46.718 the reason I can close it because in
05:23:48.480 here I have added a call back here to
05:23:50.638 close it. Right. Perfect. So now
05:23:55.440 uh yeah I think that I uh forgot to do
05:23:59.280 one thing here for the name also add
05:24:02.400 form message here outside of the form
05:24:05.520 control and do the same thing here.
05:24:08.400 Great. Right. So now if you try submit
05:24:10.080 this you will see the errors and yeah
05:24:13.280 looks like inside of um my agent schemas
05:24:17.840 I need to change this to be
05:24:19.878 instructions are
05:24:23.160 required. There we go.
05:24:27.240 Perfect. So
05:24:29.160 now let's just see what's being unused
05:24:32.400 here.
05:24:34.160 So this is what we're going to do
05:24:36.600 now in the on success. Let's do the
05:24:41.480 following. Let's use query client to
05:24:45.680 invalidate queries
05:24:48.760 brpc
05:24:50.600 aents.get many and pass in the query
05:24:54.840 options like this.
05:24:59.120 And later on I'm going to add a to-do
05:25:01.638 here. Uh invalidate individ. Oh actually
05:25:05.760 we can do it. Yes my apologies. We can
05:25:07.840 already do if initial
05:25:11.160 values has the id. We can also
05:25:14.760 invalidate another
05:25:17.160 thing called PRPC agents what we just
05:25:21.360 created get one because in here we need
05:25:25.360 to pass the id and in this case that is
05:25:28.480 the initial value ID. So what's going on
05:25:30.878 here? Basically uh when on success
05:25:35.120 happens when we create the agent and we
05:25:37.760 successfully do it uh we are going to
05:25:40.638 invalidate the get many so that this
05:25:44.240 right here refreshes. So we're going to
05:25:47.120 add a new agent and we want to
05:25:48.560 immediately show that new agent in the
05:25:50.718 table. So that's why we need to
05:25:52.400 invalidate those queries. Right? And
05:25:55.520 this is where you actually see the power
05:25:57.520 of using pre-fetching in server
05:25:59.440 components and uh handling it the rest
05:26:02.000 in the client components because the
05:26:04.480 fact that in
05:26:06.520 the page tsx of our whoops
05:26:11.718 page.tsx in our agents we do the
05:26:14.600 prefetching it does not prevent us from
05:26:18.320 continuing to refetch this through
05:26:21.040 invalidation or any other method. Right?
05:26:23.760 So that's why I prefer using this way.
05:26:27.200 You could have done the same thing. Of
05:26:28.878 course, if you used just normal use
05:26:31.040 query here, but if you used uh if you
05:26:34.160 actually load the data in the server
05:26:36.000 component and then passed it as a prop,
05:26:37.840 you would not be able to revalidate it
05:26:39.920 like this. Right? That's why I really
05:26:42.160 like this way of doing it. And also um
05:26:44.958 this invalidated queries, I think that
05:26:46.958 they are a promise. So if you want to
05:26:49.600 you can mark this as async and then you
05:26:51.440 can await them.
05:26:53.440 like this. I'm not sure if you have to
05:26:55.480 wait. Not exactly sure. I mean, they
05:26:58.240 definitely still work, but you know. And
05:27:00.878 let's also add on success here, but
05:27:03.360 since it's optional, do it like this.
05:27:06.638 And two S's. There we go. So, this will
05:27:09.600 then close it, right? Why do I say it
05:27:12.000 will close it? Well, because we added
05:27:15.360 that to happen
05:27:17.798 here. Uh, great. So now let's go ahead
05:27:22.480 and go inside of the on error here. And
05:27:25.440 what we have to do here is the
05:27:26.878 following. So in here we have to first
05:27:28.718 go inside of our root layout. So in the
05:27:31.600 app folder layout and add a toaster from
05:27:35.520 components UI soner. So it's not a
05:27:38.840 wrapper. It is just a component to be
05:27:42.080 added like this. And then instead of the
05:27:44.638 agent form, you're going to get the
05:27:47.120 error here. And you're going to do toast
05:27:50.638 error
05:27:51.718 here. Error
05:27:54.600 dossage. And you can import toast from
05:27:59.320 soner like
05:28:01.320 this. And I will just add a to-do
05:28:05.040 comment here. Let me just go here. To-do
05:28:09.600 check if error code is
05:28:13.400 forbidden. Redirect to forward
05:28:16.160 slashupgrade. So we don't yet have this
05:28:18.558 but we will have this in the future. Uh
05:28:21.600 great. So the only thing that is uh
05:28:24.480 unused at the moment is use router.
05:28:28.360 Um and there is something that um yeah
05:28:32.718 okay let's just remove use router then
05:28:35.600 because we can't really redirect
05:28:37.520 anywhere at the moment. Great. So I
05:28:39.760 think that this is now ready to create.
05:28:42.718 Let's try it actually. So, make sure
05:28:44.878 that you're logged in and let's try a
05:28:47.360 test and test instruction
05:28:49.958 here. Instruction. Let's click create
05:28:53.600 and let's
05:28:54.920 see. I think that it works. Test
05:28:58.480 instruction. It's right here. There we
05:29:00.240 go. Test instruction and test. Perfect.
05:29:03.760 So, it's exactly what we wanted. Let's
05:29:05.680 try another one. Let's click create. And
05:29:08.878 there we go. It immediately adds that
05:29:10.958 here. Perfect. Uh now let's go ahead and
05:29:14.958 let's try an error. So how do we achieve
05:29:18.878 an error? Well, I think there is one way
05:29:21.840 of achieving the error without changing
05:29:24.040 anything. So if you go inside of source
05:29:26.558 app folder dashboard agents page, you
05:29:29.120 can see that this page is not
05:29:31.480 protected. So unauthorized users can
05:29:34.638 actually see this page. And I purposely
05:29:37.280 told you that in the get many you leave
05:29:40.798 it as the base procedure the same as get
05:29:43.798 one. The reason I told you is so I can
05:29:46.718 demonstrate this. So I'm going to copy
05:29:50.480 this URL and I'm going to log
05:29:53.240 out and then I will go back here in the
05:29:56.240 agents. As you can see I can access this
05:29:58.798 page even though I'm logged out. So this
05:30:01.600 would be a very bad thing, right? But
05:30:05.440 what happens when a logged out user
05:30:07.200 actually tries to create something? You
05:30:09.600 get back uh what I now notice is a typo.
05:30:13.080 Unauthorized. Let me just quickly fix
05:30:15.440 that inside of my DRPC in it.
05:30:20.040 Unauthorized. Right? So even if you
05:30:24.160 forget to do uh a redirect in the server
05:30:30.000 page, right? Because in my
05:30:32.360 dashboard
05:30:34.040 page, I do this session and I do the
05:30:37.040 redirect. So even if you forget to do
05:30:39.040 that somewhere, you don't have to worry
05:30:40.958 because that is our last line of
05:30:43.120 defense. Our first line of defense are
05:30:45.760 going to be the protected APIs. So now
05:30:49.280 what I want you to do is the following.
05:30:50.958 I want you to go inside of your agents
05:30:53.120 procedure. So modules agent server
05:30:55.040 procedures and now change this to
05:30:58.760 protected procedure and you can remove
05:31:01.840 this comment and same thing for get one
05:31:04.400 protected
05:31:05.798 procedure and you can remove the base
05:31:08.160 procedure input and now when you do a
05:31:10.638 refresh here you will see that logged
05:31:13.120 out users cannot even see the data. So
05:31:17.360 even if you forget to protect your page
05:31:20.480 and redirect the user away, you don't
05:31:23.440 have to be afraid because our APIs are
05:31:27.120 completely protected. As you can see
05:31:28.718 here, we have this unfortunate maximum
05:31:30.958 update depth which I talked about
05:31:32.558 previously. But you can see that
05:31:33.680 eventually it stops and it will just
05:31:35.680 show the user an error and if they even
05:31:38.080 try to create something, they also get
05:31:40.240 the unauthorized error. So there's
05:31:42.040 absolutely nothing they can do. But
05:31:45.040 let's just wrap it up with doing proper
05:31:47.520 redirect here as well. So we can just
05:31:50.080 copy this from the dashboard. This
05:31:52.240 entire thing here. There we go. And we
05:31:54.798 can do it before we even add these like
05:31:59.320 that. So import out from lib out. Let me
05:32:03.600 just move it here.
05:32:05.840 import
05:32:06.760 headers from next
05:32:10.120 headers and import
05:32:13.000 redirect from next
05:32:16.200 navigation. So now even if you refresh
05:32:20.080 you can no longer access that. So I just
05:32:22.400 told you the worst case scenario which
05:32:24.958 is you forget to redirect from the
05:32:27.440 server component nothing dangerous will
05:32:29.680 happen. That's because our that's our
05:32:31.760 this is our last line of defense, right?
05:32:34.160 This is not what's actually protecting
05:32:35.840 our app. TRPC and the proper use of
05:32:39.680 procedures are protecting our app.
05:32:42.480 That's what's handling the errors and
05:32:44.400 that's what's protecting the actual
05:32:46.320 data. Perfect. So I think we've learned
05:32:48.798 a lot in this agents form. Uh so we have
05:32:51.798 successfully created the protected
05:32:53.920 procedure agents create procedure list
05:32:56.080 header uh new agent dialogue and the
05:32:58.480 agent form which is reusable for both
05:33:00.558 create which we demonstrated but we we
05:33:03.120 can't yet demonstrate the update. And
05:33:05.200 now let's go ahead and merge these
05:33:07.718 changes. So I'm going to go ahead and
05:33:11.200 click on my branch here. Create a new
05:33:15.480 branch. This is 11 agents form. So 11
05:33:19.920 agents form. Let's stage all of these
05:33:24.000 changes by clicking on the plus. So they
05:33:26.160 are now all uh staged. 11
05:33:29.638 agents
05:33:31.558 form. Commit and publish the
05:33:35.798 branch. Now let's go ahead and open this
05:33:38.958 pull
05:33:41.558 request and let's wait for the review
05:33:44.878 from code rabbit.
05:33:48.080 And here we have the summary. So we have
05:33:50.320 added a global toss notification for
05:33:52.400 improved user feedback which is our
05:33:54.320 toaster. We introduced a new my agents
05:33:57.280 page header with a new agent button. We
05:33:59.440 added a model dialogue for creating new
05:34:01.360 agents with form validation and avatar
05:34:03.440 preview. We implemented an agent
05:34:05.680 creation form supporting both creation
05:34:07.760 and editing
05:34:09.558 workflows. Perfect. So in here of course
05:34:12.718 we have a more in-depth walk through. Uh
05:34:15.680 as you can see it noticed that we added
05:34:17.920 a TRPC a protected TRPC middleware for
05:34:20.638 securing the end points right and in
05:34:23.680 here we have a whole sequence diagram
05:34:25.680 explaining the state of our app right
05:34:27.680 now uh but this part right here we've
05:34:30.558 already covered this in the previous
05:34:32.878 pull requests what we are interested now
05:34:35.040 is in this part when user clicks on new
05:34:38.480 agent and in here it rent it clicks it
05:34:41.760 here in the agent list header which
05:34:43.680 opens a dialogue new agent dialogue
05:34:46.160 which finally uh renders the agent form.
05:34:50.000 So the user then submits the form in the
05:34:53.200 agent form which then calls the create
05:34:55.920 which is the protected procedure. So
05:34:58.240 that's calling the TRPC server, right?
05:35:00.958 The TRPC server is a protected
05:35:03.040 middleware in this case because it's a
05:35:05.280 protected procedure. So it calls the
05:35:07.280 session. If it has no session, it fails.
05:35:09.760 But if it has a session, it inserts the
05:35:12.400 new agent right here in the database and
05:35:15.120 the database returns back the created
05:35:16.958 agent to the TRPC server which then on
05:35:20.000 success handles the rest of the events.
05:35:23.280 So as I said this sequence diagrams will
05:35:26.160 become more and more useful as we go on.
05:35:29.360 In here we have some comments. Of course
05:35:31.600 we left a to-do here. So it recommended
05:35:34.400 adding the update agent in case we
05:35:36.400 forgot. But we did not forget we
05:35:39.040 actually don't have it yet. We just
05:35:40.958 developed ahead of time in here. Uh it
05:35:44.718 gave us the proper advice of handling um
05:35:47.680 non-existent agents. So yes, when we
05:35:50.400 actually go and develop this get one
05:35:52.798 method which we are going to have to uh
05:35:55.280 well advance a bit further than this. We
05:35:57.680 will also have to handle this throwing
05:35:59.840 an error if the agent is not found. So
05:36:02.160 yes, this is a good suggestion and we
05:36:04.080 will add that later when we develop the
05:36:06.638 actual agent get one
05:36:09.080 page. So we can resolve this and in here
05:36:12.480 in the get many uh it tells us to
05:36:15.958 actually protect this procedure even
05:36:18.558 further by only loading the agents from
05:36:21.040 that user. That is exactly what we are
05:36:23.840 going to do in the next chapter when we
05:36:26.558 load this in the actual table. Right?
05:36:29.680 because right now we're just JSON
05:36:31.280 stringify the agents. In the next
05:36:33.440 chapter, we're going to develop the
05:36:34.958 actual table for that and that will
05:36:37.360 include this fix as well. So, all great
05:36:40.558 suggestions, exactly what I plan to do
05:36:42.718 in the following chapters. So, let's go
05:36:44.878 ahead and merge this now.
05:36:48.040 Perfect. And once you've merged it, go
05:36:50.638 back to main and click synchronize
05:36:53.760 changes and click okay here. And you
05:36:57.760 should be all good. Let's go ahead and
05:37:00.080 check our graph here. We just merged 11
05:37:04.718 agents form which marks the end of this
05:37:07.600 chapter. Amazing amazing job and see you
05:37:10.558 in the next
05:37:12.760 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
05:37:15.360 go ahead and develop the agents data
05:37:17.840 table. This will include a nice display
05:37:20.480 for existing agents, but also a nice
05:37:23.440 empty state if no agents have been
05:37:25.760 created. So the first step is to
05:37:28.480 implement the data table component. Now
05:37:31.200 as you probably know already inside of
05:37:33.840 our source components UI we have all
05:37:37.920 shats components and that includes the
05:37:40.878 table component. But what we are looking
05:37:43.840 for is not the table component. We are
05:37:46.080 looking for a data table component. So
05:37:49.040 in order to implement that we have to go
05:37:51.200 back to chats UI
05:37:53.400 documentation and find data table. Now
05:37:57.760 we can skip the first step of the
05:37:59.840 installation here because we already
05:38:01.600 have the table component. Instead we can
05:38:04.320 immediately go to step two adding
05:38:06.558 tanstack react table. So make sure that
05:38:10.558 you are on your main branch here and
05:38:13.280 make sure you have s syn syn
05:38:14.680 synchronized all
05:38:17.400 changes. Once you've done that go ahead
05:38:20.240 and install penstack react table and you
05:38:23.520 can add a
05:38:24.920 legacy pure deps to avoid any pure
05:38:28.320 dependency errors. Great. Once you have
05:38:31.680 added that you can go ahead and run your
05:38:33.520 app. I will now open my package JSON
05:38:36.798 just to show you the new package version
05:38:42.120 8.21.3. You don't have to strictly use
05:38:44.400 the same version. I don't think uh this
05:38:46.718 package often introduces breaking
05:38:49.160 changes. Great. So now let's go ahead
05:38:52.878 and build this. So we're going to start
05:38:54.878 by adding columns. Let's go ahead and do
05:38:57.440 that. I'm going to go inside of source
05:39:01.160 modules agents UI components and inside
05:39:05.440 of here I'm going to define
05:39:07.958 columns tsx like that and I'm going to
05:39:12.638 copy this snippet. Now in case you're
05:39:15.040 having trouble finding this
05:39:16.320 documentation page or it changed a lot
05:39:20.160 uh by the time you found this video, no
05:39:23.120 worries. We're going to go line by line
05:39:25.040 and see what's going on here. So it's
05:39:26.798 not too big of a file, don't worry. So
05:39:29.680 first of all, make sure it's marked as
05:39:31.280 use client. Make sure you add a tsx
05:39:33.760 extension and import column defaf from
05:39:36.080 your newly installed package. In here,
05:39:38.638 we just defined a very simple payment
05:39:41.040 type with ID, amount, status, and email.
05:39:44.080 And then what we do is we return an
05:39:46.400 array of uh column definitions according
05:39:50.080 to the payment type. So we render the
05:39:52.320 status, the email and the amount using
05:39:55.040 the accessor key and the header keys.
05:39:57.760 That's
05:39:58.840 it. So the next thing we have to
05:40:01.120 implement is the data table component.
05:40:04.000 Let's go ahead inside of components and
05:40:05.840 let's create
05:40:09.798 data-table.tsx. And again I'm going to
05:40:11.920 copy this entire snippet and paste it
05:40:14.320 here. And we're now going to go ahead
05:40:16.400 and look at it. So first of all use
05:40:19.600 client then the necessary imports from
05:40:22.160 tanstack react table which are column
05:40:24.320 def flex render get core row module
05:40:27.040 model sorry and use react table then
05:40:30.558 table table body table cell table head
05:40:33.600 table header and table row from
05:40:35.920 components UI table which is the
05:40:37.440 component we looked at in the beginning
05:40:39.040 to confirm that we have it. We then
05:40:41.360 created a generic data table props which
05:40:44.000 accepts any table data and any table
05:40:47.120 value here. And after that we export
05:40:50.080 function data table and we pass it these
05:40:52.480 generics right here. And we destructure
05:40:54.878 the columns and the data from the data
05:40:56.958 table props passing the generics. Our
05:41:00.558 table constant is defined through use
05:41:03.120 react table which simply accepts the
05:41:05.600 data the columns and the core row model.
05:41:10.320 Inside of here we have a div with a
05:41:12.480 class name rounded medium and border and
05:41:15.440 it encapsulates our entire table. Then
05:41:18.638 we have a table from the actual
05:41:21.680 components UI table inside a table
05:41:24.798 header. And inside of the table header,
05:41:26.958 what we do is we map over each of our
05:41:30.558 header groups and we render out the
05:41:32.558 table row. And then inside of this row,
05:41:37.200 we go inside of the individual header
05:41:39.280 group inside of the headers and we map
05:41:41.680 out each individual table head, which
05:41:44.080 would most likely be the column. So this
05:41:46.400 would be uh status, email and amount in
05:41:50.080 table head components. We check if it's
05:41:53.120 placeholder and render null. Otherwise
05:41:55.520 we use the flex render function which we
05:41:58.320 imported from tan stack react table and
05:42:00.878 we pass in header column column def
05:42:03.280 header in the first parameter and header
05:42:05.600 get context in the second parameter. And
05:42:08.240 we end the table head and the table row.
05:42:10.638 And we do the exact same thing uh for
05:42:13.200 the table body. Here you can see it's
05:42:15.040 not anything more complicated. The only
05:42:17.360 thing we do here is we do a length check
05:42:21.280 in case it is empty. What we do here is
05:42:24.798 we just render an empty table row and we
05:42:27.840 give it some default height and text
05:42:29.840 center here. And we also give it a
05:42:32.000 proper call span. So it takes the entire
05:42:35.120 width of our table. So I hope that this
05:42:38.798 kind of uh made it easier for you to
05:42:41.200 understand what's going on. And if you
05:42:44.240 struggled finding the actual snippet,
05:42:46.878 you can now find it
05:42:49.480 here. So now that we have our data
05:42:52.638 table, let's see what is the next step
05:42:55.280 here. So let's go ahead and render that
05:42:58.400 table and let's also invent this get
05:43:02.480 data it seems. So this is how we're
05:43:04.878 going to do this. Now we're going to go
05:43:06.718 inside of our views agents views here
05:43:08.958 and we're going to render the data table
05:43:13.160 component from that that dot
05:43:16.040 dot/components data table and in here
05:43:19.280 we're not going to use this data. Uh
05:43:21.878 instead we are going to define our own
05:43:24.400 data here. Let me just copy this.
05:43:28.480 Let's just do const mock data and just
05:43:31.680 do you know something like this id
05:43:34.718 amount status it needs to be either
05:43:37.798 pending or processing or success or
05:43:40.718 fail. So make sure it's it matches this
05:43:43.798 type like this mock data and just pass
05:43:47.440 in the data to be mock data here and you
05:43:51.040 also have to pass in the columns. So
05:43:53.120 columns will be the columns which we can
05:43:55.558 import from dot dot components columns
05:43:59.120 like this. And let me just see if I did
05:44:02.080 this correctly here. Uh I think the
05:44:04.958 problem here is in the mock data here.
05:44:08.798 We have to assign it to be payment type
05:44:12.958 and we might have to oh it's just
05:44:15.120 payment. Okay. So let's import payment
05:44:17.840 from the columns and set it as an
05:44:20.520 array. There we go. Now you no longer
05:44:23.280 have any errors here. And now if you
05:44:25.760 visit this and refresh the agents page,
05:44:28.718 you should see your data table here.
05:44:31.840 Let's wait. And there we go. This is our
05:44:34.240 data table with our mock data. And this
05:44:37.600 is actually enough for us to no longer
05:44:40.718 need to follow this. If you want to, you
05:44:42.480 can take a look to see exactly how you
05:44:44.798 would add some more things here. But we
05:44:47.760 are going to take it from here and
05:44:49.680 develop our own version. So the first
05:44:52.718 thing I want to do is go back inside of
05:44:54.320 the data table and modify it just a bit.
05:44:57.520 So I'm going to go ahead and give this
05:44:59.280 div besides uh I'm going to change
05:45:01.760 rounded medium to rounded large. I'm
05:45:04.080 going to leave the border and I'm going
05:45:05.520 to set the bg to be background and
05:45:07.920 overflow to be hidden. So that's the
05:45:10.718 first thing I'm going to do. Then what
05:45:12.958 I'm going to do is I'm going to delete
05:45:16.160 the table header
05:45:17.798 entirely like that. So I only want the
05:45:20.718 table body to render. And in the table
05:45:23.600 body I'm going to go ahead and do the
05:45:25.280 following. I'm going to give this one a
05:45:28.000 class name of cursor pointer like that.
05:45:31.040 So when I hover over it looks clickable.
05:45:34.320 And I'm going to introduce a new prop
05:45:36.920 here after the data on row
05:45:40.600 click like this to accept the row which
05:45:43.280 is a type of data and return a void. So
05:45:47.280 I can now destructure on row click here
05:45:50.638 and I will simply add it to the table
05:45:54.638 row. So on
05:45:56.040 click arrow function on row click
05:45:59.600 question mark dot and then execute and
05:46:02.000 pass in the row. original inside. So
05:46:05.040 it's optional. Uh so make sure you added
05:46:08.000 the question mark here. Great. Now what
05:46:12.160 I want to do is I want to modify the
05:46:13.760 table cell here by giving it a class
05:46:15.840 name text small and padding of
05:46:19.400 four. And in the table row here I want
05:46:23.200 to change this to be height 19. And also
05:46:27.280 add text muted foreground and change
05:46:30.718 this. Oh well this can be no results.
05:46:32.878 That's fine. Yeah. And remove table head
05:46:35.680 and table header from
05:46:38.600 here. There we go. Just like that. So
05:46:42.440 now what I want to do is I want to go
05:46:46.638 back inside of my agents view here and
05:46:49.280 just start uh modifying this a bit. So
05:46:51.920 give the wrapping div here a class name
05:46:53.920 of flex one padding bottom of four px of
05:46:57.280 four and the px of 8 flex flex column
05:47:03.120 and gap y of four. There we go. So looks
05:47:07.840 a little bit better. What I want to do
05:47:10.878 now is the following. I want to go
05:47:13.360 inside of my columns and in here I'm
05:47:15.760 going to modify this to no longer use
05:47:17.920 this payment type. Instead I will use
05:47:21.840 agent get one from the types which we
05:47:25.280 did in the previous chapter. Right?
05:47:27.120 Remember when I told you to create the
05:47:29.440 uh get one protected procedure. So we
05:47:31.840 are reusing it one more time here as our
05:47:35.520 column data type here. And now we're
05:47:38.798 going to go ahead and modify the actual
05:47:42.558 columns here. So the first one we're
05:47:44.320 going to render will be the name of the
05:47:46.080 agent and the header will be agent name.
05:47:50.320 And now what we can actually do already
05:47:53.680 is we can go back inside of the agents
05:47:56.638 view here and we can use this data. We
05:47:59.680 no longer have to use the mock data at
05:48:01.878 all. And you can remove this. There we
05:48:04.480 go. And you can already see that you now
05:48:07.360 have all of your agents here. So if you
05:48:09.280 add a new
05:48:10.440 agent, it will appear. There we go. So
05:48:13.440 we are now rendering them inside of
05:48:15.360 here. Perfect. So let's go back inside
05:48:18.320 of the columns and let's improve the way
05:48:22.480 the name field is showing. So we can do
05:48:25.520 that by adding the cell property here.
05:48:28.320 The structure the row and render a div
05:48:31.680 here with a class name
05:48:34.280 flex flex column and gap y of one.
05:48:38.638 Inside another div with a class name
05:48:41.200 flex items center and gap x of two. And
05:48:45.360 then finally a generated avatar
05:48:47.480 component which is a self-closing tag.
05:48:50.958 And inside of here give it a variant of
05:48:54.558 bots neutral seed of
05:48:59.798 row.name and a class name of size six.
05:49:04.160 So make sure you have added this import
05:49:06.000 here and already you will see the
05:49:08.878 avatars of your bots. Let's confirm. So
05:49:11.600 test seems to be having let's try test
05:49:13.920 two. It seems to be having this oneeyed
05:49:16.400 row. When I click
05:49:20.040 create, it has the exact same face.
05:49:23.638 Perfect. So now that we have added that
05:49:26.878 below the avatar, add a span element
05:49:29.520 rendering row original name
05:49:32.520 here. And give the span a class name
05:49:36.718 font semibold
05:49:39.958 capitalize. There we go. And now outside
05:49:43.440 of this div, open up a new div with a
05:49:45.840 class name of flex items center gap x of
05:49:50.760 two. And inside of this div, a new div
05:49:54.400 with a class name flex items center gap
05:49:58.480 x of
05:50:00.040 one. And in here, let's add a
05:50:03.400 corner
05:50:04.920 right down icon. Make sure you import
05:50:08.558 this from lucid react.
05:50:12.638 And give this icon a class name
05:50:15.638 of size three and text muted foreground.
05:50:21.280 And then add a span element
05:50:25.400 row. But give this a class name of text
05:50:29.240 small text muted foreground maximum
05:50:33.120 width of 200 pixels truncate and
05:50:38.280 capitalize. So we are adding truncate so
05:50:41.200 that it cuts off right. Uh and let's
05:50:44.558 just see. So this should be corner down
05:50:48.958 right icon. So make sure you don't do
05:50:51.600 the same mistake as I did. Corner down
05:50:54.080 right icon. There we
05:50:56.440 go. So flex item center gap x1. Let's
05:51:00.558 add uh maybe
05:51:02.040 1.5
05:51:03.878 here. Uh or maybe let's try two. Yeah,
05:51:08.718 maybe two is a bit better. And now that
05:51:10.638 I'm looking at it, we don't even need
05:51:13.680 the outer div here. So, you can just
05:51:15.600 remove the outer div. I think it's
05:51:17.040 exactly the same. Yeah, it is perfect.
05:51:19.760 So, yeah, you can choose gap x1 or gap x
05:51:24.000 2. I think maybe two gives it a little
05:51:26.160 bit more breathing room. Maybe 1.5 as
05:51:29.920 the perfect middle. I don't know.
05:51:32.160 Sometimes I can't decide. Okay. Uh,
05:51:35.120 great. So we can now render our avatars
05:51:39.360 here nicely our agents. And now let's
05:51:43.040 also add another key
05:51:45.798 here. Accessor key meeting count and
05:51:50.798 header will be
05:51:52.680 meetings and cell here will be a
05:51:57.080 row like this. Add a badge from
05:52:00.878 components UI badge. So you already have
05:52:04.718 this component installed instead of
05:52:06.718 source components UI badge. And in here
05:52:11.120 what we're going to do is simply render
05:52:13.440 a video icon from Lucid React and give
05:52:15.840 it a class name text blue 700 like this.
05:52:21.280 And then add row original dot meeting
05:52:24.558 count which will throw you an error
05:52:26.320 because it does not exist yet. And then
05:52:28.958 after it check if row original meeting
05:52:32.958 count is equal to one and then add
05:52:35.440 meeting or
05:52:37.798 meetings and give the badge a variant of
05:52:41.120 outline and a class name flex items
05:52:45.440 center gap x2 and in order to modify the
05:52:49.280 SVG size we have to target it like this
05:52:51.920 and then add
05:52:53.558 size-4. So right now you can see that it
05:52:56.558 looks a little bit broken
05:52:58.840 here. So let's go ahead and improve it
05:53:02.480 by going inside of our procedures for
05:53:06.558 the agent and finding the get one here.
05:53:11.680 And in here in the select what we have
05:53:14.798 to do is we have to add the meeting
05:53:17.120 count option and I think that we can
05:53:19.840 just import
05:53:21.480 SQL from Drizzle RM. And for now just
05:53:24.878 like put a number five. I think this
05:53:27.200 will render the number five. But what
05:53:29.600 happens now is that our existing agent
05:53:31.920 will only return this. And you can also
05:53:34.480 put like a type of number here. But in
05:53:37.680 order to preserve all other fields, we
05:53:40.320 can use a spread get table columns from
05:53:44.878 drizzle or so. So I imported SQL from
05:53:47.920 here as well and pass in agents.
05:53:52.000 So now the existing agent has the
05:53:54.080 meeting count which is a number and you
05:53:55.920 no longer have any errors here. Let's
05:53:58.718 refresh and see. Looks like it's uh not
05:54:01.840 yet working just because I'm not sure
05:54:04.638 how to actually uh use this to mock a
05:54:08.120 number. Let me just uh try something.
05:54:13.440 What we can do for now since this is
05:54:15.920 obviously not working, we can do
05:54:17.798 database dot dollar sign count agents
05:54:22.798 and I think we can just do this. Let's
05:54:24.480 just count all
05:54:25.718 agents. Will that give us a number? I'm
05:54:28.160 still not getting uh any number.
05:54:31.600 So, how about I try agents where
05:54:35.638 equals and
05:54:37.638 um let's
05:54:39.638 try user agents do user id
05:54:44.200 matches we can now since this is a
05:54:46.480 protected
05:54:48.760 procedure we can now extract context
05:54:52.000 from here and we can pass in the context
05:54:54.400 out session user
05:54:58.760 ID let's try
05:55:01.718 now. Okay. I I can't get a number from
05:55:05.680 here for whatever reason. So, yeah, it's
05:55:11.000 okay. Let's remove the meeting count
05:55:13.520 from now. Let's remove this. Sorry for
05:55:16.160 making you do all of this. It's because
05:55:17.840 we are missing the meetings schema,
05:55:19.680 right? I'm trying to mock a number here.
05:55:22.080 So, we're just going to set this to be
05:55:24.638 five meetings, for
05:55:27.878 example, like this.
05:55:31.360 And uh you do add a meetings count
05:55:36.440 here and just use the
05:55:39.160 SQL five with the type of number and
05:55:42.718 import
05:55:43.718 SQL from drizzle or um and you can add a
05:55:47.840 little to-do change to actual
05:55:53.798 count. There we go. So this is how it's
05:55:56.080 going to look like. Besides everything
05:55:57.920 regarding uh the first agent here, we
05:56:00.240 are also going to actually count the
05:56:02.160 number of meetings it has. So we need
05:56:06.000 the meeting count property to exist here
05:56:09.200 because otherwise the accessor key gets
05:56:11.718 confused. So that's why I'm trying to
05:56:14.240 mock the number later. What we're going
05:56:16.480 to do is we're going to actually count
05:56:18.240 the number of meetings associated with
05:56:20.400 our agent or our agent associated with
05:56:23.840 the number of meetings. Um, perfect.
05:56:26.798 Yes. So, this is what I wanted us to do.
05:56:28.798 And now what we have to do is we have to
05:56:30.718 implement the empty uh stage as well.
05:56:34.958 So, let's go ahead and let's go to
05:56:40.040 neon.te. So, we can go inside of our
05:56:43.600 project here. tables or you can use the
05:56:46.480 Drizzle Studio. It's the same thing,
05:56:48.638 right? And let's go inside of agents,
05:56:50.798 select all of them, and delete all
05:56:52.718 agents. So, it's completely empty. And
05:56:54.798 now when you refresh here, uh you should
05:56:57.280 see no results. But I want this to have
05:57:00.000 this nice uh view as well here. So, uh
05:57:04.958 let's go ahead and go inside of here.
05:57:07.040 I'm going to fix this error in a moment.
05:57:08.878 Let's just wrap up the um empty state,
05:57:13.120 right? So I will leave this for later.
05:57:15.840 In order to implement the empty state,
05:57:18.798 we can get started faster by copying the
05:57:23.040 error state. So let's copy the error
05:57:26.160 state and let's paste it. Let's rename
05:57:28.558 it to empty state like
05:57:32.520 this. And export con state like that. Uh
05:57:37.600 and then what we're going to do is the
05:57:40.320 following.
05:57:43.120 I'm going to remove this part and just
05:57:46.400 put flex flex column item center justify
05:57:50.360 center. And then I'm going to remove
05:57:54.558 this div entirely like that. And then in
05:57:59.840 here I will not render the alert. I will
05:58:02.798 render an image from next forward
05:58:05.840 slashimage.
05:58:08.000 And in here for now I will set the
05:58:11.120 source to be logo
05:58:13.480 SVG. Alt will be empty. Width will be
05:58:18.680 240. And height will be 240 as well. And
05:58:23.200 then in here this will be flex flex
05:58:25.600 call. Let's set gap Y six. Here let's
05:58:29.440 set maximum width to be medium. MX to be
05:58:33.480 auto. And let's put text center here.
05:58:37.200 And this will also have a text muted
05:58:40.120 foreground. There we go. Like that. So
05:58:43.520 now that we have the empty state, let's
05:58:46.080 go ahead and render it. So inside of
05:58:48.958 agents view here where we have this
05:58:50.878 error, let's go below it and let's do
05:58:53.440 the following. If
05:58:56.760 data.length is equal to zero, go ahead
05:59:00.080 and render the
05:59:01.320 empty
05:59:03.558 state like this. So I'll just move it
05:59:06.718 here with the error state here and the
05:59:09.840 title will be create your first
05:59:13.160 agent and the description will be create
05:59:16.718 an agent to join your
05:59:19.320 meetings. Each agent will follow your
05:59:23.878 instructions and can interact with
05:59:27.718 participants during the call. And let me
05:59:31.520 just fix this join. There we go. So now
05:59:35.360 you should see your big logo here and
05:59:37.840 the text create your first agent. So
05:59:39.840 what we have to do now is do a proper
05:59:42.638 image here. What I've prepared for you
05:59:46.558 is a link you can visit or you can use
05:59:48.558 the link in the description if this URL
05:59:50.718 stops working. So,
05:59:56.360 cwonia.com/me-assets and when you visit
05:59:58.520 that you will get redirected to this uh
06:00:02.000 public GitHub with all of the uh images
06:00:05.840 and assets for this projects or if you
06:00:07.840 have access to the source code you can
06:00:09.280 just go directly into my public folder
06:00:11.440 where I will add them. So, let's go
06:00:14.000 ahead and add
06:00:16.280 empty.svg. Since it's an SVG, you have
06:00:19.200 multiple ways of uh downloading it. You
06:00:21.920 can download it or you can click code
06:00:24.160 and just copy the entire code here and
06:00:27.040 then just go inside of your public
06:00:30.638 folder. Add
06:00:34.600 empty.svg. Click this open file using VS
06:00:37.760 Code standard text binary. Right? And
06:00:40.080 just paste the code inside. And there
06:00:42.480 you go.
06:00:44.000 you now have uh the empty
06:00:48.240 uh placeholder.
06:00:50.040 Perfect. So now let's go back inside of
06:00:52.480 empty state and let's use
06:00:55.718 empty.svg. And there we go. Now you have
06:00:58.400 the empty state. Create your first
06:01:00.000 agent. Create an agent to join your
06:01:01.520 meetings. Each agent will follow your
06:01:03.280 instructions and can interact with the
06:01:04.878 participants during the call. And the
06:01:07.440 moment you add uh a new agent, test
06:01:11.920 test. Click
06:01:14.760 create and this will now refresh and you
06:01:17.760 will no longer see that empty state.
06:01:20.080 Perfect. Amazing. Amazing job. So that's
06:01:22.400 exactly what we intended to do. We added
06:01:25.520 data table empty state and we obtained
06:01:27.680 the assets. So in the next chapter we're
06:01:30.558 going to focus on this the pageionation
06:01:34.160 right and also this the filters but
06:01:38.080 that's going to be for the next chapter.
06:01:40.240 Amazing job. And let's go ahead and
06:01:42.480 create review and merge this pull
06:01:45.240 request. So I'm going to go ahead and
06:01:48.958 click on my branches here. Create a new
06:01:51.360 branch. This will be 12 agents data
06:01:54.840 table I believe.
06:01:58.360 Yes. Let's go ahead and confirm we're on
06:02:01.360 the new branch. Stage all changes
06:02:05.240 here. Let's wait a second. There we go.
06:02:08.320 stage changes 12 agents data table.
06:02:12.878 Let's commit and let's publish this
06:02:17.080 branch. There we
06:02:19.080 go. Let's go to our GitHub here. Let's
06:02:23.120 open a pull
06:02:24.840 request. There we go. Uh and I already
06:02:29.120 remembered something that I will have to
06:02:30.878 do. Yeah. So, let's
06:02:33.558 uh let's open this pull request and I'm
06:02:36.638 going to let the reviewer do its thing
06:02:39.080 here. But uh let's go back inside of uh
06:02:42.558 so it's completely fine to stay inside
06:02:44.160 of this branch, right? We can work in
06:02:45.680 it. Let's go inside of our agent view
06:02:49.840 here. UI view is agents view. And I just
06:02:53.520 want to see why am I getting this error
06:02:55.440 here. So something's wrong with the
06:02:57.200 columns. agent get
06:03:00.360 one meeting
06:03:04.680 count. So something is not matching
06:03:09.480 here. Let's go inside of our columns to
06:03:12.400 see accessor key is
06:03:14.840 name meeting
06:03:17.958 count. What if I comment this out?
06:03:21.520 Nothing.
06:03:23.558 Okay. So for some reason it's
06:03:27.558 throwing an error
06:03:30.840 here. I'm not exactly sure why. So I
06:03:33.840 will uh experiment with this a little
06:03:35.920 bit. We can leave it like this for now.
06:03:37.600 Actually it's not it's not too big of a
06:03:39.878 problem. Uh so I will explore this
06:03:42.558 actually in the next chapter. So we're
06:03:44.638 going to fix this error alongside adding
06:03:46.798 our pagionation and
06:03:48.920 things. And here we have the code
06:03:51.280 summary. So let's read the walkthrough.
06:03:54.320 A new table display feature for agent
06:03:56.480 data was introduced using the tanstack
06:03:58.718 react table library. This includes the
06:04:01.040 new UI components for table columns, a
06:04:03.440 generic data table and an empty state.
06:04:06.400 The agents view now renders agent data
06:04:08.798 in a styled table and the backend query
06:04:11.200 for agents was updated to explicitly
06:04:13.360 select columns and added a computed
06:04:15.920 field which is our mock meetings
06:04:18.600 account. In here we have a whole
06:04:20.798 sequence diagram. But we already know
06:04:22.958 how this works, right? It's but and it
06:04:25.520 goes even further displaying the data
06:04:27.840 table or the empty state here. And in
06:04:30.718 here it left some expected comments. It
06:04:32.958 really doesn't like that we hardcode
06:04:35.120 this. So it gives us some action items.
06:04:37.520 Define or migrate a meetings table in
06:04:39.520 your schema. We will be doing that very
06:04:42.160 soon, but I do want to wrap up agents
06:04:45.080 first. In here, it uh suggests adding an
06:04:48.320 action button to the empty state. So,
06:04:50.240 this could be a good idea. But since we
06:04:52.638 already have a new agent here, I kind of
06:04:54.558 feel weird having another one, you know,
06:04:56.798 here. So, I'm going to leave it like it
06:04:59.558 is. And uh in here, of course, uh it
06:05:03.040 doesn't like that this is hardcoded. We
06:05:05.200 will change that later when we actually
06:05:07.600 uh have this value here. Uh and in here,
06:05:11.520 it noticed that we removed the table
06:05:13.920 header. Uh, so very good that it noticed
06:05:16.958 that, but we did it on purpose. Great.
06:05:20.400 So, let's go ahead and merge this pull
06:05:22.320 request. So, in the next chapter, what
06:05:24.400 we're going to have to do is work on
06:05:27.040 these filters here and fix this issue.
06:05:30.480 Even though I'm 99% sure this types are
06:05:34.280 confused simply because of uh Oh, the
06:05:38.638 types are confused. Oh, I just realized
06:05:41.840 that all this time I've been adding the
06:05:44.320 meeting count to get one. I also have to
06:05:47.520 add it to get many. That's why it's so
06:05:50.480 confused here. Okay, so we know how to
06:05:54.000 fix it, but we don't have to do it now
06:05:55.760 since we just merged this pull request,
06:05:58.240 right? Let's not change anything in this
06:06:00.080 branch anymore. And instead, let's go
06:06:02.638 and change this to main. And let's
06:06:05.680 synchronize our changes here.
06:06:09.280 There we go. Let's click on our source
06:06:12.798 control, click on the graph, and confirm
06:06:14.798 that you just merged commit 12 inside of
06:06:18.718 here and added all of these things.
06:06:21.520 Perfect. So, amazing, amazing job. Let's
06:06:24.160 mark that as completed
06:06:26.360 here and see you in the next
06:06:31.160 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
06:06:33.920 implement agents filters. So the reason
06:06:37.120 I didn't put any screenshots here is
06:06:39.440 because the filters were already
06:06:41.520 featured in our chapter 12. So it's
06:06:44.320 going to be this search bar and the
06:06:46.680 pagionation right here. We're going to
06:06:49.600 start by modifying our
06:06:52.040 agents.get many procedure. We are then
06:06:55.120 going to add a package called nux. We're
06:06:58.240 going to implement the UI components for
06:07:00.080 the filters which will include the
06:07:01.680 search input and pagination. And we are
06:07:04.080 then going to synchronize the React
06:07:06.000 server component filters and client
06:07:08.160 filters because it's very important to
06:07:09.920 do that when we do
06:07:11.718 prefetching. Let's start with modifying
06:07:13.920 the agents get many procedure. And
06:07:16.000 before we actually do anything, well, as
06:07:18.798 always, confirm you are on your default
06:07:20.638 branch and confirm that you have
06:07:22.480 synchronized your changes here. And then
06:07:26.000 head inside of modules agents UI views
06:07:30.400 agents view. And in here we have this
06:07:33.680 bug. And the bug is because in the get
06:07:36.320 many procedure here I don't have the
06:07:39.280 meeting count. So what I'm going to do
06:07:41.440 is I'm just going to copy what I did for
06:07:43.200 the get one and I will add it in here
06:07:47.040 like this. And as you can see
06:07:49.600 immediately the error now goes away. And
06:07:52.958 I think that now so all that time in
06:07:56.400 previous chapter I was adding the
06:07:58.000 meeting count in the get one procedure
06:08:00.878 and I was so confused why I couldn't
06:08:03.360 read it in my table here. So I think
06:08:05.680 that now once I add it to the get many
06:08:07.878 procedure just a hard-coded number five.
06:08:11.120 I think that we can go inside of the
06:08:12.958 columns. So instead of agents UI
06:08:15.120 components columns and I think that I
06:08:17.280 can actually now try reading row um my
06:08:20.718 apologies. Let's dstructure the row
06:08:23.480 here. Row original meeting count. Can I
06:08:27.840 do that now? Let's refresh. There we go.
06:08:30.160 So number five is rendered here. So if I
06:08:32.878 change this in the get many procedure to
06:08:35.280 number six and refresh, it shows number
06:08:39.520 six. Perfect. So now we can go ahead and
06:08:44.160 add that little tweak here. If row
06:08:48.440 original meeting count is equal to one,
06:08:51.760 show meeting otherwise show
06:08:54.840 meetings. So it shows the proper the
06:08:58.000 grammatically correct text. Perfect. So
06:09:01.040 that's the first issue fixed. We no
06:09:03.200 longer have any errors inside of our
06:09:05.040 agents view. The second thing that we
06:09:07.600 now have to do is go back inside of our
06:09:09.520 get many procedures and what we have to
06:09:12.080 do is implement the proper filters here.
06:09:15.200 So before we do dotquery, let's add
06:09:17.920 dotinput here and let's open up an
06:09:21.160 object. So I think we already have zod
06:09:23.760 imported. Perfect. So now inside of here
06:09:26.000 we can add the filters. The first one
06:09:28.160 will be the page which will be a type of
06:09:30.240 number and the default will be one as in
06:09:34.160 the first page. And for the page size
06:09:37.798 here, we're going to add Z dot
06:09:41.320 number with a minimum of one. And let's
06:09:45.600 add a maximum of 100. And the default of
06:09:51.360 Whoops, let me just go back. And the
06:09:53.600 default of 10. And then we're going to
06:09:56.638 have search, which is a string. And
06:10:00.360 nullish. Uh, nullish. This one like
06:10:04.160 this. And you can set the entire input
06:10:06.160 to be
06:10:07.160 optional. Uh my apologies. So you have
06:10:10.080 to go inside of this parenthesis and
06:10:13.200 then put optional
06:10:14.760 here. The reason I want to put optional
06:10:17.440 is because we have default values for
06:10:19.760 the page and the page size. So if the
06:10:23.040 user doesn't want to pass any filters,
06:10:25.120 they don't have to pass any filters,
06:10:26.920 right? Uh and also here's another thing
06:10:29.920 you have to be aware of. And let me just
06:10:33.360 indent this a
06:10:35.718 bit like this. I just want to format it
06:10:40.638 a bit nicer so it's clearer which part
06:10:43.200 is
06:10:44.440 which. There we go. Like this. So
06:10:47.360 protected procedure as an input. Inside
06:10:50.080 of that input, we have an optional
06:10:52.240 object which has three possible
06:10:54.718 parameters. The page, page size, and
06:10:57.200 search. Why did I add optional to the
06:11:00.558 entire Z object? Well, for example, if
06:11:04.878 we go inside of our agent form
06:11:08.200 component, you might remember that in
06:11:10.798 here we do some invalidation here,
06:11:14.000 right? Specifically, what we do is
06:11:16.240 whenever we create a new agent, we
06:11:18.240 refetch agents get many by invalidating
06:11:21.280 it. Now if I were to change
06:11:25.160 this to not be optional, you can see
06:11:27.520 that I immediately get an error here
06:11:29.680 because this expects the object inside
06:11:33.760 for the options. But since I am
06:11:36.000 invalidating this, I don't really know
06:11:38.878 what to pass here except just an empty
06:11:41.520 object. So it kind of looks weird,
06:11:44.240 right? And not only that, but for
06:11:46.798 example, in my agents view here, I also
06:11:49.920 have a problem. Even though I just want
06:11:51.760 to use the default options, I now have
06:11:53.920 to just pass an empty object inside.
06:11:57.280 Right? So that's why I prefer to add dot
06:12:01.718 optional to the input here. I mean sorry
06:12:05.680 to the Z object here and instead just
06:12:09.040 make sure that I have some defaults. For
06:12:11.600 example, the search doesn't need to have
06:12:14.320 a default but pagenation needs to have
06:12:16.878 some defaults. And if I handle the
06:12:18.558 defaults inside, I can safely put the
06:12:21.120 entire object to be optional. And guess
06:12:23.360 what? I don't have to modify the rest of
06:12:25.360 my existing queries here, right? I don't
06:12:28.400 have any errors. Great. So now I don't
06:12:32.000 like magic numbers in my code. So what
06:12:34.558 I'm going to do is I'm going to go
06:12:35.600 inside of source folder and create
06:12:39.080 constants.ts. And inside of the
06:12:41.200 constants uh file, I'm just going to
06:12:45.040 export the default page to be number
06:12:47.600 one, default page size to be 10, maximum
06:12:50.798 page size to be 100, and the minimum
06:12:52.958 page size to be one. So just these four
06:12:56.718 constants here. Let's export them. And
06:12:59.200 the reason I put them in the constants
06:13:01.040 folder file in source is because I will
06:13:04.240 use the exact same defaults and
06:13:05.920 constants for all of my get many
06:13:08.638 procedures.
06:13:10.000 If you want to have different, you know,
06:13:11.680 per module, you can then put it inside
06:13:13.520 of the agents module and use them. But
06:13:15.520 since I know that all of them are going
06:13:16.878 to be the same, I will just use them in
06:13:18.558 the source folder. Great. So now let's
06:13:21.440 go ahead and replace the page default
06:13:24.958 with default page from the constants.
06:13:28.718 Right? Let's import it. Then the minimum
06:13:32.320 here will be minimum page size from the
06:13:35.240 constant, maximum page size and default
06:13:39.600 page size. Make sure to use default page
06:13:43.440 size and not default page here. So you
06:13:46.320 should have all of these imports here.
06:13:48.718 There we go. Perfect. So now that we
06:13:51.360 have added that we can work with those
06:13:55.040 inputs here. Let's dstructure the
06:13:58.000 context and the input from here.
06:14:00.878 And the first thing I want to do is the
06:14:03.760 following. I want to add a where here.
06:14:07.600 And inside of here, since I already know
06:14:09.840 that I will have multiple uh equals, I
06:14:13.200 will add and from Drizzle ORM. So make
06:14:17.200 sure you import and from Drizzle ORM.
06:14:20.400 And then I'm going to open this. And the
06:14:22.400 first one will be an equals for agents
06:14:25.520 user ID to be equal to my context out
06:14:30.480 user ID or you can use context out
06:14:33.440 session user ID whichever you prefer.
06:14:35.920 They're the same. So that's the first
06:14:38.638 thing that I want to load. I only want
06:14:41.200 to load agents that this user created
06:14:45.360 because in the create procedure
06:14:48.080 uh we set the user ID to the currently
06:14:51.200 logged in user. So that's how I know
06:14:53.760 that this will work
06:14:56.040 automatically. But besides that we now
06:14:58.638 also have some more filters like the
06:15:01.360 search filter. So for this we can check
06:15:04.638 if we have the search and if we do let's
06:15:07.840 use I like from drizzle OM. So make sure
06:15:13.200 you add this import
06:15:15.000 here and let's go ahead and pass in
06:15:19.160 agents.name like this. Open
06:15:22.520 backex. Go ahead and add percentages and
06:15:26.240 render the input dot search like this.
06:15:30.718 And this will be input dot
06:15:34.680 search.
06:15:37.958 Whoops. Like that. Otherwise
06:15:42.280 undefined. Perfect.
06:15:44.638 So now um that we have that let's go
06:15:48.558 ahead and you know now that I thinking
06:15:51.600 you know I kind of don't like this
06:15:54.878 uh I don't like that the
06:15:56.840 input has to be uh accessed through a
06:16:01.440 question mark here. I have a feeling
06:16:04.000 this might complicate things because
06:16:06.320 even though we've set this things to
06:16:08.240 default
06:16:09.920 uh the input by is as you can see it's
06:16:13.200 possible for it to be
06:16:14.840 undefined. So I'm going to revert my
06:16:18.320 decision. I know I told you to put this
06:16:20.480 to optional but I would rather we don't
06:16:23.440 do that. So remove optional from here.
06:16:27.600 And you can see immediately I have
06:16:29.200 errors here. I would rather we handle
06:16:31.280 those errors than have unsafe access to
06:16:35.600 the variables inside my input because
06:16:37.760 what I can do now for example is I can
06:16:40.558 extract search page and page
06:16:43.558 size from the input safely right whereas
06:16:47.600 if this is set to
06:16:51.000 optional I'm you can see this is any
06:16:54.080 right obviously this doesn't work
06:16:57.718 properly so I don't I think I would
06:17:00.480 rather do it like this because now I
06:17:02.558 have the proper information. I think one
06:17:05.520 possible solution is to set the
06:17:08.920 input like
06:17:11.000 this and then its number or undefined.
06:17:14.160 But then again, you know, I don't like
06:17:16.798 working with values like this because
06:17:18.400 this is technically not correct. Page
06:17:20.558 size will always be a default something.
06:17:23.840 So it's obviously not inferring these
06:17:25.840 things correctly. So that's why let's
06:17:28.240 not use optional. Uh I I regret doing
06:17:31.600 that. So I'm going to remove it now. And
06:17:34.080 I'm going to instead do what I said I
06:17:37.680 didn't like, but let's do it. So add
06:17:41.760 this Z object to your protected get many
06:17:44.520 procedure. You can go ahead and
06:17:46.320 destructure these items here. Leave
06:17:48.798 everything as it is. And let's fix our
06:17:51.360 errors. So what you can do is you can
06:17:53.840 search for agents.get get many and you
06:17:57.280 will find all the places you are using
06:17:59.040 it. So let's start with the first place
06:18:01.520 here. This is the source app dashboard
06:18:04.558 agents page where we prefetch. What we
06:18:07.360 have to do now is add the empty object
06:18:11.558 inside. Let's go ahead and do it again.
06:18:13.920 Agents get many. The second one is
06:18:17.200 inside of the agent form. So inside of
06:18:20.240 modules agents UI components agent form.
06:18:23.120 when we invalidate the
06:18:25.080 queries pass an empty object here.
06:18:28.638 Great. And the last one is inside of the
06:18:31.120 agents views. So source modules
06:18:35.558 agents UI views agents view. And go
06:18:40.160 ahead and pass that here. There we go.
06:18:42.878 And we just
06:18:44.200 resolve all syntax errors. And we can
06:18:47.040 now safely dstructure the search page
06:18:48.958 and page size from the input here. And
06:18:51.520 then I can do search
06:18:54.120 here and I can do search here. There we
06:18:57.760 go. So it's easier for us to build these
06:19:01.320 queries. Okay. So yeah, you can see me
06:19:04.080 change my mind in real time now. Great.
06:19:06.958 Now let's add order by here and let's
06:19:10.480 add descending from Drizzle
06:19:14.200 ORM and in here descend by
06:19:17.440 agents.created created at and then
06:19:21.520 combine it with descending agents id.
06:19:25.440 The reason we need the second one is for
06:19:28.680 pagination. So let's add a limit to be
06:19:31.280 page size here and let's add an offset
06:19:34.320 here to be open parenthesis page minus
06:19:37.600 one multiplied by page size. So each
06:19:41.760 following page will offset the last
06:19:45.000 result. And now let's calculate the
06:19:47.760 total. So con total will be await
06:19:51.958 database
06:19:53.638 select
06:19:55.160 count and use the count not from the not
06:19:59.280 from console use it from drizzle o and
06:20:02.878 execute it. So make sure you import
06:20:04.798 count from Drizzle
06:20:09.638 OM and add from agents here and where
06:20:16.080 just go ahead and copy the
06:20:18.280 query like this. But in here we will not
06:20:22.160 do any ordering or any limit or offset.
06:20:25.280 So we are interested in the total number
06:20:27.600 of items that we are working with
06:20:30.638 because only with the total number can
06:20:33.360 we calculate the total pages. So let's
06:20:36.638 use math
06:20:37.958 ceiling total first one in the array dot
06:20:41.920 count or what you can do is just the
06:20:44.000 structure total like this. So then you
06:20:47.760 can do total dot count looks nicer this
06:20:51.040 way and divide it by page size.
06:20:56.320 And then in here instead of returning
06:20:58.160 the entire data what you're going to do
06:21:00.878 is you're going to return items under
06:21:04.360 data total under
06:21:07.958 total.ount and total pages as a separate
06:21:12.160 last item. Great. And now that we have
06:21:14.480 introduced this, we have to go ahead and
06:21:16.958 fix again uh all the places that use get
06:21:20.878 many. So let's search for agents get
06:21:22.958 many in the page. Everything seems to be
06:21:25.360 okay because we're not actually working
06:21:27.120 with the data agent form. Everything
06:21:29.680 okay because we're not actually working
06:21:31.760 with the data agents view and we have
06:21:34.638 some problems. The one we can fix
06:21:36.798 immediately here is
06:21:38.840 data.length. So now what we have to do
06:21:41.520 is data
06:21:44.520 items.length and in here data do items
06:21:48.798 as well. There we go. So, that's how we
06:21:51.360 fixed that issue. Now, let's refresh and
06:21:53.840 let's see. There we go. I can only see
06:21:56.400 one now. Uh, and let's go ahead and
06:21:58.798 let's try
06:22:00.200 creating some more elements here. For
06:22:03.920 example, let's
06:22:05.400 create five of
06:22:07.638 them just so we can try out our
06:22:11.400 filters. Okay. So I have five agents and
06:22:14.240 I will go inside of my procedures get
06:22:16.160 many and I will change the default page
06:22:19.200 size here to be for example two. So when
06:22:24.000 I refresh now you will see these two
06:22:27.920 right here. And even though I entered
06:22:30.160 the exact same name for them which is a
06:22:32.400 coincidence you can see by instructions
06:22:34.558 that they are different uh agents here.
06:22:37.360 Perfect. So we can now bring this back
06:22:40.000 to 10 and just refresh. There we go. And
06:22:45.680 also uh you can now try and changing
06:22:50.878 inside of you suspense query here. If
06:22:53.520 you want page size for example, you can
06:22:56.080 do it here. But this is also where you
06:22:59.600 will probably encounter this issue. And
06:23:02.480 it says
06:23:04.600 unauthorized. Why does it say
06:23:06.558 unauthorized? It seems like a pretty
06:23:08.558 cryptic error for a very simple thing we
06:23:11.360 did. We just used the options that were
06:23:13.760 given to us. Well, the reason why is
06:23:17.040 because you're using use suspense query.
06:23:20.400 That means that it's expecting the data
06:23:22.718 to be populated from somewhere. More
06:23:25.400 specifically, data populated from
06:23:27.840 dashboard agents page prefetch. The
06:23:31.120 difference is in the server component
06:23:33.840 you prefetch without any explicit page
06:23:37.280 size but in here you are fetching with
06:23:40.798 the page size. So what happens is that
06:23:44.160 this use suspense query notices hey I
06:23:47.600 have different query options that means
06:23:50.160 I cannot guarantee that I will have the
06:23:52.400 same result as the cache that was given
06:23:54.878 to me. So I will fall back to use query.
06:23:59.200 The problem is one thing that doesn't
06:24:01.920 get transferred when it does its
06:24:04.680 internal fallback to use query is the
06:24:08.360 headers which means that it loses the
06:24:11.718 authentication. So that's one uh gotcha
06:24:15.360 as we would say right that's one
06:24:17.760 potential foot gun with using this and
06:24:21.120 not being careful. So the the error is
06:24:24.160 very cryptic. It just says unauthorized.
06:24:26.718 That's because we are authorized when we
06:24:29.638 prefetch. But in here, we lose that
06:24:32.798 chain of events because we have
06:24:35.680 different query options. So in order to
06:24:38.798 not throw an error, but to still attempt
06:24:41.360 to load the data, what we do is we
06:24:43.600 switch to use query and then we load
06:24:47.440 with our new query options. and
06:24:50.160 somewhere in between we lose those
06:24:52.240 headers and we fail to uh call that
06:24:56.240 procedure because that procedure is
06:24:58.480 protected and then we get into this
06:25:01.200 weird state where the data actually
06:25:03.680 loads but we still get this error right
06:25:06.400 so it's kind of weird but the fix is
06:25:08.718 very easy you just have to make sure
06:25:11.840 that what you prefetch is exactly the
06:25:16.558 initial state of what you expect in the
06:25:19.600 suspense query. You can later of course
06:25:22.558 uh change this to be page size 10,
06:25:25.360 right? You can modify this later, but
06:25:27.680 the initial load needs to be exact. Once
06:25:31.440 you do this and
06:25:33.080 refresh, no more errors, right? But if
06:25:36.320 one of these doesn't match, you will
06:25:39.440 start getting that unauthorized error
06:25:41.920 because the queries don't match. So now
06:25:45.520 go ahead and clean this entirely. make
06:25:48.000 it an empty object and make it an empty
06:25:50.080 object here. Perfect. What we're going
06:25:52.638 to do now is we're going to add Nuks.
06:25:55.760 So, let's go ahead and do npm install
06:25:58.920 nooks- legacy pier depths and I will
06:26:02.480 show you my Nooks version just in case.
06:26:06.120 Oops. Package JSON Nooks. So,
06:26:10.680 2.4.3. Uh the major version here is
06:26:13.520 quite important because uh NX one for
06:26:16.718 example is a completely different usage
06:26:19.600 than NX 2. So in case your NS behaves
06:26:23.840 very differently than mine, feel free to
06:26:26.400 install NX 2.4.3 to get the exact same
06:26:30.320 experience as I do. Now let's go ahead
06:26:33.840 to our root layout application. So
06:26:36.958 source app folder
06:26:39.480 layout and in here import Nuks
06:26:44.280 adapter from Nooks adapters
06:26:48.280 next. And go ahead and wrap the entire
06:26:52.200 app inside of the Nooks
06:26:55.638 adapter. There we go. And now you will
06:26:59.040 see what Nooks basically is. So uh what
06:27:03.680 I like to do is I like to create a use
06:27:08.958 filters hook inside of my uh respective
06:27:12.320 module. So, let's go inside of agents
06:27:14.080 here and let's create
06:27:17.798 hooks. And inside of here, go ahead and
06:27:21.520 add
06:27:23.400 use filters or let's do use agent agents
06:27:30.760 filters.ts like that. And inside of
06:27:34.400 here, what you're going to do is import
06:27:36.958 parse as
06:27:39.798 integer, parse as string, and use query
06:27:44.878 states from
06:27:46.920 Nuks. Export con use agent
06:27:50.200 filters, agents
06:27:52.600 filters, and
06:27:55.160 return use query states
06:27:58.840 here. and pass in the search to be parse
06:28:02.440 as
06:28:05.160 string dot with default empty string and
06:28:08.878 with
06:28:09.798 options clear on default
06:28:13.160 true. Copy and paste this and set the
06:28:16.320 second one to be the page. And this will
06:28:19.520 be parse as integer like this. Oh, and
06:28:24.478 this
06:28:25.320 is an object not an array. Sorry. There
06:28:28.718 we go.
06:28:29.840 And with default it's going to be uh
06:28:32.958 default page from the constants like
06:28:37.080 this and clear on default will be true.
06:28:40.000 So one thing that we are not going to
06:28:41.920 add here is the page size. Why? Well
06:28:45.040 because nooks is basically a way to
06:28:47.878 synchronize your search params for
06:28:51.120 example search hello with your use
06:28:56.240 state. Let's call it like that. So, we
06:28:58.638 are basically going to use Nooks as a
06:29:01.200 way to synchronize the URL state with
06:29:04.320 our React component, right? It's going
06:29:06.878 to be a two-way binding where they will
06:29:09.840 control each other in sync. But what I
06:29:12.718 don't want is for the user to be able to
06:29:15.520 append, you know, page
06:29:18.840 size 1 million and break our app. That's
06:29:22.638 why I won't allow the user to change
06:29:24.638 page size from the URL. Great. So that
06:29:28.000 is use agents builders here. Uh and now
06:29:31.280 that we have that, we have to go ahead
06:29:33.760 and actually uh well use them. So this
06:29:38.000 is what we're going to do. We're going
06:29:40.240 to go inside of source inside of modules
06:29:45.080 agents and let's go inside of uh UI
06:29:48.760 components agents list header right
06:29:52.240 here. And in here I'm going to get the
06:29:55.840 filters and set filters from use agents
06:30:00.360 filters. So you can see that it behaves
06:30:03.600 exactly like use state. So you get a
06:30:06.638 very familiar API and a very powerful
06:30:09.718 feature. So now let's go ahead and
06:30:13.840 create the search filter. So I'm going
06:30:17.680 to go ahead and go uh for the search
06:30:20.878 filter. Yeah. Hm.
06:30:23.920 Uh let's do it inside of the component
06:30:25.680 here. Let's call it agents search
06:30:29.400 filter.
06:30:31.558 DSX. Import the search
06:30:35.558 icon from lucid react. Import the input
06:30:40.320 component from components UI input and
06:30:43.120 import use agents filters from hooks.
06:30:47.120 Export const search filters. Search
06:30:49.680 filter.
06:30:51.760 Extract the filters and set filters from
06:30:54.718 use agents
06:30:56.520 filters. Return a div with a class name
06:30:59.440 of
06:31:00.920 relative. Render the input component
06:31:03.760 here. Give it a placeholder of filter by
06:31:07.320 name. Give it a class name of height 9,
06:31:10.798 background color of white, width of 200
06:31:13.440 pixels, and PL of 7. Give it a value of
06:31:17.600 filters.
06:31:20.080 And on change, grab the event and call
06:31:23.920 set filters just as you would set state
06:31:27.120 and set the search value to event target
06:31:30.520 value. And then add a search icon from
06:31:34.400 lucid react. Make sure you add this
06:31:36.478 import here. and add a class name size
06:31:39.440 for absolute left to top 1 and a half
06:31:44.320 minus translate on the yaxis 1 and a
06:31:47.840 half and text muted
06:31:51.320 foreground. Great. Now, let's go back
06:31:54.080 inside of our agents list header
06:31:56.920 here and let's go outside of this div
06:32:01.400 here and add a
06:32:05.958 div with a class name flex items center
06:32:11.680 gap x2 and padding of
06:32:14.680 one and render the search filter
06:32:19.798 component. And let's actually call it um
06:32:23.320 agents search filter since the name is
06:32:26.240 already agents search
06:32:29.320 filter and render it
06:32:32.040 here. And now in here you should see a
06:32:35.120 text filter by name. And I want to bring
06:32:38.240 your attention to the URL. So this is my
06:32:40.878 URL at the moment. Whoops. Let's go
06:32:44.000 here. This is my current
06:32:46.680 URL. HTTP localhost 3000 agents. When I
06:32:50.798 type test, you can see that it
06:32:53.120 immediately
06:32:54.600 changes to this. It appends the test
06:32:58.080 there. And if I change this to test 1 2
06:33:01.120 3. So if I change my URL this time and
06:33:03.440 press enter, you will see that this is a
06:33:06.400 two-way binding. Meaning that whatever I
06:33:08.878 change in the URL will appear here and
06:33:11.040 whatever I change here will appear in
06:33:13.040 the URL. And you're probably wondering
06:33:15.760 what does the width default and clear on
06:33:19.280 default do. Well, this is simply to
06:33:21.920 improve user experience. So the default
06:33:24.878 search is an empty string. And in here
06:33:27.440 we are telling it if you get an empty
06:33:30.160 string, simply remove this from the URL.
06:33:33.600 So we don't want a scenario where this
06:33:36.478 is the URL. It just looks weird. Why not
06:33:39.520 just remove it? So that's exactly what
06:33:41.840 will happen if I clear this. You can see
06:33:44.240 that now my URL is back to the original.
06:33:48.718 So that's what the with default and
06:33:51.040 clear on default options do. Perfect. So
06:33:54.718 now that we have that, what we can do
06:33:57.320 here is go back inside of the agents
06:34:00.160 list header and now let's do this font
06:34:04.718 is any filter modified and simply do
06:34:08.558 double exclamation points and look for
06:34:10.840 search. Then open a new function on
06:34:14.478 clear
06:34:15.400 filters and call set filters here.
06:34:19.440 search to be an empty string and page to
06:34:23.920 be
06:34:25.400 one and or we can use default page from
06:34:28.958 the constants just so we avoid any magic
06:34:32.200 numbers. There we go. And now we're
06:34:36.760 after agents search filter open is any
06:34:41.360 filter modified here and render a button
06:34:46.120 component with an X circle icon from
06:34:49.200 Lucid React and a clear text. Give the
06:34:53.040 icon a size four. Actually, no, you
06:34:54.958 don't have to. It automatically gets
06:34:56.878 size four if it's inside of a button.
06:34:59.440 Make sure you have imported the button
06:35:01.040 and X circle icon here. and instead give
06:35:04.400 the button a variant of outline size of
06:35:08.638 small and on click on clear filters. So
06:35:13.200 now if you type something you can clear
06:35:16.240 it with this. Great. What we have to do
06:35:19.680 now is we have to connect this with our
06:35:23.760 actual agents view here and pass the
06:35:27.520 search as an option here.
06:35:31.520 And we can do that quite easily by
06:35:34.080 adding our filters hook. So
06:35:37.400 filters use agents filters like this.
06:35:41.840 And simply go ahead and spread the
06:35:45.400 filters. We don't have to even
06:35:47.520 individually add search and then
06:35:51.320 filters. Right? We can simply spread all
06:35:54.160 of them because we know that both search
06:35:57.360 and page exist in the options. So now by
06:36:00.958 default it will use an empty string for
06:36:04.160 the search and number one for the page.
06:36:07.920 But if you try this right now, so go
06:36:10.160 ahead and clear this. And if you
06:36:11.440 refresh, you will get an error, right?
06:36:14.760 Unauthorized. But if you try searching,
06:36:17.760 you will most likely be able to query.
06:36:20.240 The only problem is that when you
06:36:22.120 refresh, when this is like the initial
06:36:24.718 state, you will get this unauthorized
06:36:27.280 error. That's because I explained
06:36:30.120 previously, you need to match your
06:36:33.040 initial load with your server component,
06:36:37.920 right? So now we have to do the same
06:36:40.478 thing here. But how do we do that when
06:36:43.360 we cannot access a hook here? Well, they
06:36:47.200 thought of that too. What we're going to
06:36:49.600 do now is we're going to go back inside
06:36:53.280 of our
06:36:55.080 modules agents and let's go ahead and
06:36:59.200 add a new file called
06:37:02.440 params.ts like this. Let's close all of
06:37:05.520 this. So just add
06:37:07.160 params.ts here. And I want you to go
06:37:09.920 inside of hooks use agent filters. And I
06:37:12.400 want you to copy this. Keep both of them
06:37:14.798 open. Actually go back inside of the
06:37:16.558 params. Paste it here but add a forward
06:37:20.840 slashserver import here. Go ahead and
06:37:23.840 import the default page from constants
06:37:26.798 here and export con filters search
06:37:32.360 params
06:37:33.878 page and simply copy everything that you
06:37:38.320 had here. So you can just copy these
06:37:40.440 two like this. There we go. So search
06:37:44.080 parse as string and this parse as
06:37:46.558 integer and no need for use query states
06:37:48.718 actually from the N server only these
06:37:50.958 two. There we go. And then export const
06:37:55.040 load search params. Create loader from
06:37:59.840 Nooks server and pass the filters search
06:38:03.280 params. So now we have the equivalent
06:38:06.160 for a server component. Now you probably
06:38:09.440 have a question on your mind. Could we
06:38:12.638 use find a way to reuse this? Like can
06:38:15.520 we copy this somewhere and then use it
06:38:17.760 here and use it here in the same time?
06:38:20.320 You probably can. The problem is uh you
06:38:23.360 would have to import everything from
06:38:25.280 Nuk's server. And I just haven't found
06:38:28.638 proof that you can do that safely. Uh if
06:38:32.798 you research yourself, go to the Nuks
06:38:34.798 documentation page. Maybe you will quite
06:38:37.040 easily find an example where they show
06:38:39.600 you that you can use Nuk's server in
06:38:43.280 client components. But I just don't want
06:38:45.760 to teach you anything incorrectly. So
06:38:48.160 that's why I'm repeating myself twice.
06:38:51.040 Once for the client and once for the
06:38:53.120 server just to keep it safe. So yeah,
06:38:56.080 make sure to just copy these properly so
06:38:58.958 there isn't any mismatch because
06:39:00.798 mismatch will continue to cause the
06:39:03.520 unauthorized error. Right? Great. So now
06:39:07.120 that you have the params here, go back
06:39:10.080 to your not the view but go inside of
06:39:13.040 the app dashboard agents page here.
06:39:16.798 Create an interface here. And what you
06:39:20.558 have to do is add search
06:39:23.878 params a type of
06:39:28.440 promise and search params from nooks.
06:39:32.400 And you can import it as a
06:39:34.760 type. Let's move it
06:39:38.680 here. And then go ahead and dstructure
06:39:41.440 the props here. Grab the search params.
06:39:46.160 And then simply get the params from
06:39:50.040 await load search params from modules
06:39:55.320 agents
06:39:57.000 params and pass in search
06:40:01.240 params. And then you finally have your
06:40:03.840 params here or you can call them filters
06:40:07.520 for example. So you use the same keyword
06:40:10.638 as on the client and simply spread the
06:40:14.920 filters and now you have officially
06:40:18.520 synchronized the server component and
06:40:20.958 the client component. You can see no
06:40:22.958 more errors. It now simply has the exact
06:40:26.478 same state on the client and the front
06:40:28.160 end. No matter what I do, I can properly
06:40:31.200 query this. No matter how I refresh, no
06:40:33.120 matter if I manually add search and do
06:40:36.520 something and press enter, no errors
06:40:40.080 because the server component and the
06:40:41.920 client component are synchronized by
06:40:43.920 their initial query, which is exactly
06:40:47.280 what we wanted to achieve. Perfect. And
06:40:51.520 just one important thing to know uh load
06:40:54.798 search params does not validate the
06:40:57.840 search params just in case you were
06:41:00.400 wondering right uh now let's go ahead
06:41:04.638 and let's wrap this chapter up by adding
06:41:07.440 pagionation because we just added search
06:41:09.760 and now we also have to add
06:41:13.080 pagenation. So let's go inside of the
06:41:15.520 agents view here and inside of the use
06:41:18.878 agents filters let's also extract the
06:41:21.520 set filters here and then just below the
06:41:25.120 data table here let's add data
06:41:28.400 pagination here it doesn't exist yet
06:41:31.200 we're going to create it and let's
06:41:32.878 prepare the props the page prop will be
06:41:35.280 filters
06:41:36.760 dotpage the total pages will be agents
06:41:41.120 data whoops data total
06:41:44.760 pages and on page
06:41:47.320 change will be a function which accepts
06:41:51.520 the page and simply calls set filters
06:41:55.040 with the new page. Now let's go ahead
06:41:58.080 and implement the data pagionation
06:42:00.160 component here. So I'm going to call
06:42:02.160 this agents data uh pagion actually we
06:42:05.360 can call it data
06:42:08.520 pagenation tsx
06:42:11.240 data-pagination here like
06:42:13.878 that and let's first of all define our
06:42:18.200 props page is a number total pages is a
06:42:21.360 number on page change is a function
06:42:24.638 which call which will set filters with
06:42:26.958 the new page here and let's also import
06:42:31.040 button. Whoops.
06:42:33.558 From add
06:42:36.920 /components UI
06:42:40.280 button. Let's export cons data
06:42:42.958 pagionation
06:42:46.200 here. And let's dstructure the props
06:42:51.120 page total pages and on page change
06:42:54.840 here. And let's
06:42:57.478 return a div with a class name.
06:43:01.878 Whoops. Flex items center and justify
06:43:08.680 between. Then in here a div with a class
06:43:12.240 name flex one text small and text muted
06:43:18.040 foreground and simply write page then
06:43:21.520 the number of the page of total pages.
06:43:26.160 But in case total pages is zero that
06:43:30.160 will technically mean for the user page
06:43:34.160 one internally on our server. uh if
06:43:37.360 there is no uh if there if there is no
06:43:40.958 uh data at all then the total pages are
06:43:44.160 zero. There are no pages to be made. But
06:43:47.360 for the user, it's weird to show them
06:43:49.440 page zero. That's still technically page
06:43:52.320 one for them. So that's why if we get
06:43:54.958 zero, we're just going to display the
06:43:56.958 number one for the user.
06:44:00.320 And below this, let's add a new div with
06:44:02.798 flex items center justify end and gap.
06:44:06.478 Whoops. And space x2 and py of four. In
06:44:11.280 here, let's add a button with the text
06:44:14.840 previews. And another
06:44:17.320 button with the text
06:44:20.360 next. And now what we have to do is just
06:44:23.558 assign some props to them. Let's set the
06:44:28.160 disabled here to be page one for the
06:44:33.878 previous and for the this one if page is
06:44:36.718 equal to total pages or if total pages
06:44:40.320 is equal to zero like
06:44:43.958 this. The next one will be the variant
06:44:47.040 which is the same for both of them.
06:44:49.400 Outline size
06:44:52.680 small and then we're going to have the
06:44:55.200 on
06:44:56.760 click. The first one or the previous one
06:44:59.600 will have on page change math max one or
06:45:04.958 page minus one. So we are basically
06:45:07.280 ensuring that we cannot go into negative
06:45:10.080 page requests. Right? The lowest one we
06:45:13.040 can go to is page one. And for this one
06:45:16.080 on page change math
06:45:19.320 min total pages otherwise page plus one.
06:45:23.680 This will basically ensure that we
06:45:25.680 cannot go above the total pages. I mean
06:45:28.798 we cannot make a request above total
06:45:31.000 pages. And that's it. That's our
06:45:34.440 pagionation. And now let's go back to
06:45:36.718 the agents view and let's import this
06:45:40.080 from components data pagination. And
06:45:43.040 there we go. You can now see page one of
06:45:45.200 one here and the previous and next
06:45:47.520 buttons which are disabled. In order to
06:45:49.920 see the pagionation in action, the best
06:45:52.000 way is to go inside of the constants and
06:45:54.558 simply change the default page size to
06:45:56.638 be one or two and then you will see that
06:45:59.840 you have the next page active. So when
06:46:01.920 you click next, you will see the next
06:46:04.080 set of results. And take a look at your
06:46:06.000 URL. Uh it should be showing page two.
06:46:09.360 So if I manually change this to page
06:46:11.440 three, it should load it should load the
06:46:14.320 page three. And I can go back
06:46:16.160 previously. And you can see when I do a
06:46:17.920 refresh, it stays on page two. And there
06:46:20.478 are no errors because we properly
06:46:22.638 synchronized the client and the React
06:46:25.200 server component. So you can now bring
06:46:27.440 this back to 10. you know just show the
06:46:30.000 normal amount of data just you can
06:46:32.320 always reduce it if you want to test
06:46:33.920 your pagination amazing amazing job so
06:46:37.440 you created a lot of components now
06:46:39.360 which we are going to easily reuse for
06:46:41.600 our meetings so we won't have to build
06:46:43.840 all of this all over again uh
06:46:46.440 specifically some components we are
06:46:48.478 going to copy uh but some we're going to
06:46:51.120 actually reuse that's why some of them
06:46:54.080 in here have generic names like data
06:46:56.798 pagenation and data table. So we are
06:46:59.360 later going to move these two into
06:47:02.080 global components because they will be
06:47:03.920 reusable. Uh but these ones aren't
06:47:06.958 exactly reusable but we will be able to
06:47:09.760 copy their code and then just uh build
06:47:12.638 faster. Right? Uh if you want to you can
06:47:15.120 make them reusable but sometimes I think
06:47:17.200 two abstraction is not too good of a
06:47:20.320 thing to do. Great. So now that we've
06:47:24.160 had this done let's just review. We have
06:47:27.520 modified agents get many procedure. We
06:47:29.760 added nooks. We added UI for filters
06:47:32.478 including the search input and
06:47:33.840 pagionation. And we synchronize React
06:47:36.080 server component filters and client
06:47:38.000 filters. And now let's merge
06:47:40.360 this. So I'm going to go ahead and
06:47:43.920 change to a new branch here. 13 agents
06:47:48.240 filters.
06:47:52.240 Once I confirm I am on a new branch, I'm
06:47:54.958 going to stage all of these
06:47:57.160 changes. 13 agents filters as my commit
06:48:00.478 message. I will press commit and I will
06:48:02.400 publish the branch. There we go. And
06:48:06.000 let's go to
06:48:07.478 GitHub. Let's create a pull request
06:48:11.000 here. And let's see what Code Rabbit has
06:48:14.878 to
06:48:17.160 say. And here we have our code summary.
06:48:21.040 Let's go through the walk through. This
06:48:23.600 update introduces pagionation and search
06:48:25.920 filtering for agents leveraging the new
06:48:28.160 Nooks dependency for query state
06:48:30.360 management. It adds constants for
06:48:32.718 pagenation, new hooks and components for
06:48:35.120 filters in pagenation UI and modifies
06:48:37.760 the agents query to support pageionated
06:48:39.920 and filtered results. And the root
06:48:42.478 layout now wraps providers with a new
06:48:44.958 Nooks adapter. In here we have a
06:48:48.160 detailed file by file change summary. In
06:48:52.080 here we have a sequence diagram uh
06:48:54.320 diagram explaining our new filters here
06:48:58.240 uh combined with the actual Nooks use
06:49:00.878 agents filters. So again if something is
06:49:03.840 uh not clear regarding this chapter
06:49:06.958 these kinds of diagrams come in very
06:49:08.798 handy as you can see exactly what's
06:49:10.400 going on. So the user loads the page
06:49:12.080 with search params. The agents view
06:49:14.240 components gets the filter state, search
06:49:16.320 and page using the use agents filters
06:49:18.478 here. We fetch the agents with those
06:49:20.878 filters. The agents server procedure
06:49:23.440 then returns that in form of items total
06:49:26.000 and total pages and then we render the
06:49:28.798 page by clicking on the next or
06:49:30.878 previous. We update the page in query
06:49:33.760 params and that triggers a data refetch
06:49:36.718 with the new
06:49:38.520 filters and no comments. That means we
06:49:42.558 did a very very good job. So we can
06:49:45.760 safely merge this pull request. Perfect.
06:49:49.680 Once this pull request has been merged,
06:49:52.240 let's go back inside of our IDE. Let's
06:49:54.958 go inside of our default branch. In my
06:49:57.040 case, that is main. And let's go ahead
06:49:59.680 and hit synchronize changes right here.
06:50:03.120 And then you can go inside of your
06:50:05.120 source control, open the graph, and
06:50:07.520 confirm that you just merged the agents
06:50:10.520 filters. There we go. Perfect. So that
06:50:15.120 marks the end of this chapter. Amazing,
06:50:17.200 amazing job. And see you in the next
06:50:20.520 one. In this chapter, we're going to
06:50:23.200 implement the individual agent page.
06:50:26.400 This will include modifying the existing
06:50:28.878 agents get one procedure. Creating the
06:50:31.920 agent ID server component page, adding a
06:50:35.600 data table redirect on click, creating
06:50:39.440 the agent ID client view. What we are
06:50:42.878 not going to do is implement the actual
06:50:45.680 edit and delete functionality. We are
06:50:48.000 just going to prepare the UI for that.
06:50:51.600 So let's start by modifying agents get
06:50:54.240 one procedure. As always, ensure that
06:50:57.200 you're on your default branch and feel
06:50:59.360 free to synchronize changes before
06:51:01.600 beginning just so you are sure that
06:51:04.478 everything is up to date. After that,
06:51:07.520 let's go inside of our modules agents
06:51:10.958 server
06:51:12.680 procedures and let's go inside of get
06:51:15.200 one protected procedure.
06:51:17.638 Here we can leave the input as it is.
06:51:21.440 The only thing that we are going to
06:51:22.878 modify is the following. In the wear,
06:51:26.958 we're going to add
06:51:30.360 and we already have and imported from
06:51:36.360 drizzlem. Let me just go back to my get
06:51:38.878 one here. And let me collapse this like
06:51:42.160 this so it's easier to keep track of.
06:51:44.958 inside of this end query. The first one
06:51:47.120 will be to make sure that we are loading
06:51:49.520 the agent for the ID that we pass in the
06:51:52.638 input. But the second one will be to
06:51:55.200 ensure that the agents user ID is the
06:51:59.280 same one as context. Whoops, we need to
06:52:02.558 extract context from here because this
06:52:04.798 is now a protected procedure. So make
06:52:07.360 sure you change this to protected
06:52:08.718 procedure if you haven't. Context.out
06:52:11.520 out dot user ID. So besides loading by
06:52:16.718 the agent ID, we are also going to
06:52:18.878 confirm that this user has access to see
06:52:21.920 that user ID. And the way we do that is
06:52:25.200 by checking if that user is the author,
06:52:28.320 the creator of that agent. And then what
06:52:31.920 we're going to do is if there is no
06:52:34.160 existing agent, let's throw
06:52:37.798 new TRPC error which you can import from
06:52:42.718 at the RPC
06:52:46.360 forward/server. And in here return a
06:52:50.080 code not found and a message agent not
06:52:55.000 found like that. There we go. And you
06:52:58.638 can leave the meeting count to be a
06:53:01.040 dummy number still. We are later going
06:53:03.680 to change it. Now that we have that,
06:53:06.878 let's go ahead and let's implement the
06:53:09.840 agent ID
06:53:11.958 page. So we're going to go inside of app
06:53:14.558 folder dashboard agents and create a new
06:53:17.360 folder inside of square brackets agent
06:53:19.760 ID. Be mindful of the capitalization
06:53:22.718 here because the the way you write the
06:53:26.558 variable inside will be the way you will
06:53:29.040 access it. So if you put a lowerase I,
06:53:32.558 you will need to use a lowerase I in the
06:53:34.958 code. If you put an uppercase I, you
06:53:37.760 will have to use the uppercase I. So
06:53:39.520 just be mindful. Let's create a page.x
06:53:43.120 inside of here. And let's go ahead and
06:53:46.320 create an interface props. And the
06:53:49.040 params will be a type of promise and
06:53:51.840 inside agent ID which is a string. So
06:53:55.200 this is what I was talking about. It
06:53:57.360 needs to be agent ID because we named
06:53:59.760 this folder agent ID instead of square
06:54:02.000 brackets. Right? So then this will look
06:54:04.320 like localhost 3000 forward/ aents and
06:54:07.840 then 1 2 3 and then 1 2 3 will be the
06:54:11.360 agent ID. So it's basically kind of an
06:54:15.360 uh unh hardcoded part of the URL. So,
06:54:18.160 dynamic part of the URL, that's the word
06:54:20.400 I was looking for. Let's go ahead and do
06:54:23.680 a default export here for the page.
06:54:26.878 Let's add the props here. Let's get the
06:54:30.558 params. Let's turn this into an
06:54:32.400 asynchronous method. And let's go ahead
06:54:36.080 and dstructure the agent ID await
06:54:39.320 params. There we
06:54:41.638 go. Uh, now let's go ahead and do the
06:54:45.760 prefetching. So query client is get
06:54:48.638 query client from tRPC
06:54:51.958 server add TRPC from here as
06:54:55.400 well and then just do void query client
06:54:59.360 prefetch query like that and inside add
06:55:02.798 TRPC agents get one query options and
06:55:07.920 inside ID pass the agent
06:55:10.840 ID. There we go. We have now prefetched
06:55:14.160 this
06:55:15.478 agent. Now inside of here, let's render
06:55:18.638 our hydration boundary which you can
06:55:21.040 import from tanstack react query and
06:55:24.240 also add dehydrate from here. Pass in
06:55:27.440 the state here to be dehydrate query
06:55:31.638 client just like that.
06:55:35.200 Now, inside of here, go ahead and add
06:55:37.360 suspense from React and error boundary
06:55:41.360 from React error boundary. So, make sure
06:55:45.040 to add these two. Now, let me just
06:55:47.600 properly align
06:55:49.878 these. For both of these, give them a
06:55:53.558 fallback. And for now, you can just
06:55:55.840 write a paragraph loading
06:55:59.558 error. And then in here render the agent
06:56:02.638 ID view and pass in the agent ID prop to
06:56:06.320 be agent
06:56:08.920 ID like
06:56:11.400 this. Now let's go ahead inside of our
06:56:15.080 modules
06:56:16.840 agents UI views and create the new
06:56:20.958 agent- id-
06:56:25.080 view.tsx. In here create a prompts
06:56:28.120 accepting already the structured agent
06:56:31.360 id. So in here it's a promise in the
06:56:33.520 params but in here we are passing it
06:56:35.840 directly. So we have it like this. Let's
06:56:39.400 export const agent ID view here.
06:56:44.478 Let's use the props
06:56:46.200 here and let's get the agent
06:56:49.878 ID and inside of here let's prepare the
06:56:52.878 DRPC from use DRPC and let's prepare
06:56:58.958 um I think that's it for now so let's
06:57:01.040 just uh leave it like this and let's get
06:57:04.160 our data using suspense query from tan
06:57:09.280 stack react query here and pass in gRPC
06:57:14.000 agents get
06:57:15.320 one query options and pass in the agent
06:57:20.760 ID as the ID like this. There we go. So
06:57:25.280 now our use suspense query matches our
06:57:29.120 hydration because this is the only prop
06:57:31.440 we are sending.
06:57:33.160 Perfect. Now that we have this, we can
06:57:35.600 go ahead and render out some information
06:57:38.798 here.
06:57:40.558 So inside of here, return a
06:57:43.798 div with a class name of flex one, py of
06:57:48.958 4, px of 4, md px of 8, flex flex
06:57:55.680 column, and gap y of
06:57:58.040 four. And you can just JSON stringify
06:58:02.840 data null and two.
06:58:08.240 So now make sure to mark this as use
06:58:11.360 client as well. Go inside of the page
06:58:14.320 and render the agent ID view from
06:58:17.878 modules. There we go. So now you still
06:58:22.400 don't really have a way of accessing
06:58:24.558 this because clicking on this does
06:58:26.760 nothing. So we created the agent ID page
06:58:29.680 and now we have to add data table
06:58:31.600 redirect on the click here.
06:58:35.160 So let's go ahead inside of our modules
06:58:40.520 agents agents
06:58:43.240 view go ahead and add a router from use
06:58:46.240 router from next navigation
06:58:51.240 here and then in the data table besides
06:58:54.958 having data and besides having the
06:58:57.638 columns also add on row click here you
06:59:01.600 will get the access to row information
06:59:04.080 and do router.push here open back text
06:59:07.280 slash agents and then row
06:59:11.718 id. So now when you click on an
06:59:14.558 individual agent let's just do a hard
06:59:16.558 refresh and click here you will get
06:59:19.760 redirected to the following
06:59:22.200 URL agents and then the agent ID. So I
06:59:26.878 can double check that. Let me just
06:59:28.240 refresh my neon uh tables here. If I go
06:59:31.520 inside of my agents here, let's just
06:59:34.000 wait for them to load. This is the agent
06:59:36.000 that I clicked on. F9
06:59:38.600 vis. And I can see that's exactly what's
06:59:41.680 inside of my URL. So your URL should
06:59:44.080 look exactly like this because that is
06:59:46.798 the exact structure we have defined in
06:59:48.718 here. Agents agent ID, right? So agents
06:59:54.400 agent ID. And in here we have the JSON
06:59:58.160 information about our
07:00:00.280 agent. Now let's go ahead and let's
07:00:02.638 build the proper loading and error
07:00:06.760 states. So let's go back inside of our
07:00:10.240 agents module UI agent ID view and we
07:00:14.240 can actually borrow the agents view
07:00:16.400 states here. So copy these two exports
07:00:19.600 the loading and the error. Go inside of
07:00:22.240 agent ID view here. Paste them. And
07:00:25.120 let's rename this. So this is agent ID
07:00:27.920 view loading. And this is agent ID view
07:00:30.718 error. Import the loading state from
07:00:33.040 components loading state. And import the
07:00:35.200 error state from components error state.
07:00:37.840 This will be loading agent and this will
07:00:40.320 be error loading individual agent like
07:00:44.680 this. Make sure you've imported the
07:00:47.040 loading and the error state. Now that
07:00:49.760 you have these two, you can go inside of
07:00:52.320 your page here. And we've added this
07:00:54.478 placeholders. So now let's add the
07:00:56.558 actual agent ID view loading. And in
07:01:00.878 here let's add agent ID view error
07:01:04.718 components. So all of them from the same
07:01:07.040 import the agent ID view, agent ID view
07:01:09.920 error and the loading state. So now when
07:01:13.200 you do a refresh here you will see how
07:01:15.280 it looks like. And if you try and change
07:01:17.360 the ID to something gibberish you will
07:01:20.878 get the proper error state. You might
07:01:23.360 run into that infinite loading error,
07:01:25.600 but it's going to resolve itself in a
07:01:27.680 few seconds and it will show error
07:01:30.080 loading agent. Perfect. Oops. Let's go
07:01:33.280 to the agents
07:01:34.840 here and just select some proper agent
07:01:37.760 now so you can see the
07:01:40.520 data. Now let's go back inside of the
07:01:43.280 agent ID view component. So instead of
07:01:46.400 our modules agents UI view agent ID view
07:01:50.080 the client component here where we
07:01:52.558 stringify the data and instead let's
07:01:55.280 render the agent ID view header
07:02:01.160 component. Let's go ahead and pass in
07:02:03.840 the agent ID here to be agent ID. Let's
07:02:07.520 pass in the agent name to be
07:02:11.478 data.name. And let's pass in on edit
07:02:14.638 here to be an empty arrow function and
07:02:18.320 on remove here to be an empty arrow
07:02:20.718 function as well. Now let's go ahead
07:02:23.200 inside of the components and let's
07:02:24.798 create agent ID view
07:02:27.718 header dsx. There we go. And inside of
07:02:32.478 here, let's prepare our props. Agent ID,
07:02:36.160 agent name, on edit, and on remove. Now
07:02:40.320 let's go ahead and export
07:02:43.080 const agent ID view
07:02:47.320 header. Let's go ahead and destructure
07:02:49.840 these props
07:02:52.600 here. So that's agent ID, agent name on
07:02:56.718 edit and on
07:02:58.200 remove. Inside of here we are going to
07:03:00.798 return a div with a class name flex
07:03:03.920 items center and justify
07:03:07.478 between. And now inside of here, we're
07:03:10.638 going to add the breadcrumbs. So this is
07:03:12.638 a component that we already have. So you
07:03:16.160 can go ahead here and import all of
07:03:18.798 these from components UI breadcrumb. The
07:03:22.160 breadcrumb itself item link list and the
07:03:26.160 separator. So this is a shatzian
07:03:28.320 component and it exists inside of source
07:03:30.320 components UI
07:03:32.440 breadcrumb. Now let's go ahead and use
07:03:34.558 it to render out our header. And we can
07:03:38.000 actually import agent ID view header
07:03:41.160 here simply so you can see what you're
07:03:44.558 doing. Right? So right now nothing is
07:03:46.240 visible. And now we're slowly going to
07:03:48.400 add some more information
07:03:50.600 here. So open up the breadcrumb inside
07:03:55.120 open up the breadcrumb
07:03:59.638 list. Inside of it a breadcrumb
07:04:03.320 item. And finally the breadcrumb
07:04:09.240 link. Give the link as child prop and a
07:04:12.718 class name font medium and text extra
07:04:16.520 large. Inside use an actual link from
07:04:20.000 next
07:04:21.958 link like
07:04:24.520 this. Give this an href of forward slash
07:04:28.040 agents and in here write my agents like
07:04:32.638 this.
07:04:34.080 So now you have a text which says my
07:04:36.000 agents and when you click on it you are
07:04:38.160 redirected back to the agents page. So
07:04:40.478 you can see when you click on something
07:04:41.920 you will have this left.
07:04:44.040 Perfect. Now let's go ahead outside of
07:04:46.958 this breadcrumb item and let's add a
07:04:48.958 breadcrumb separator
07:04:50.920 here and let's add a chevron right
07:04:56.280 icon. Let's go ahead and give this a
07:04:58.718 class name. I mean the breadcrumb
07:05:00.958 separator. So let's give it a class name
07:05:02.478 of text foreground text extra large font
07:05:06.718 medium and target the SVG using this
07:05:10.400 method here
07:05:14.520 SVG size four like this. Make sure you
07:05:18.718 have imported the chevron right icon
07:05:22.000 from Lucid
07:05:23.718 React. Then after the separator here,
07:05:26.558 you can copy the breadcrumb item like
07:05:30.240 this and the link
07:05:34.760 inside and change this to have a text of
07:05:40.120 foreground like that. And the href will
07:05:45.478 be open curly
07:05:48.680 brackets replace these with back ticks
07:05:52.558 and you will go to agents agent ID and
07:05:55.600 inside you will render the agent
07:05:58.120 name like this. So when you click on it
07:06:02.160 you are already in here but it's I think
07:06:04.558 it's semantically correct to do it this
07:06:06.478 way. Right. So you can now go back to
07:06:08.000 your agents and you can see the name of
07:06:10.080 the current agent you're on.
07:06:12.878 There we go.
07:06:14.200 Perfect. So now let's go ahead and
07:06:16.878 import our uh drop-down
07:06:22.440 menu from components UI drop-own menu.
07:06:25.600 Import drop-own menu
07:06:27.638 trigger drop-down menu item and
07:06:31.840 drop-down menu
07:06:33.958 content and also import button from
07:06:37.920 components UI button.
07:06:41.760 also import trash icon and pencil icon
07:06:47.600 and more vertical icon all from lucid
07:06:51.798 react. Now let's go ahead uh after our
07:06:55.680 breadcrumb
07:06:57.400 ends, let's open a drop-down
07:07:02.280 menu. And this is important. Give it a
07:07:05.360 model false.
07:07:08.718 without model
07:07:11.558 false. The dialogue that this drop-down
07:07:16.080 opens causes the website to get
07:07:20.040 stuck or maybe precisely
07:07:23.400 uncclickable. Right? So that's why we
07:07:25.680 need model false because our drop-own
07:07:28.000 menu will open models, the edit model
07:07:31.360 and the delete module. So that's why we
07:07:33.920 have to not do double model otherwise
07:07:37.120 the website will be in this weird
07:07:39.120 hanging
07:07:40.680 state. So let's add drop-own menu
07:07:43.440 trigger
07:07:44.920 here
07:07:46.760 button. Mark this as child give this a
07:07:50.000 variant of
07:07:51.400 ghost inside more vertical
07:07:56.360 icon. And outside of the trigger, add a
07:08:01.160 content. Give it an align of
07:08:05.160 end drop-down menu
07:08:07.958 item on click on
07:08:11.558 edit and a pencil
07:08:15.080 icon with a class name of size four and
07:08:19.360 text black and the text of
07:08:22.920 edit. Duplicate this. Change the on
07:08:25.760 click to be on
07:08:27.478 remove. This will be
07:08:30.280 delete and trash icon. So the reason I'm
07:08:34.638 typing text delete but using remove
07:08:37.440 keyword is simply because delete is a
07:08:40.000 reserved uh syntax in JavaScript. So
07:08:43.680 that's why I'm using remove internally
07:08:46.000 but delete on the user side. So now in
07:08:49.920 here, as you can see, you have a nice
07:08:52.320 dropown for editing and deleting.
07:08:55.200 Currently, they do nothing. We're going
07:08:56.718 to implement that later. Perfect. Now we
07:08:59.600 can go back inside of the agent ID view
07:09:02.240 here. And below the header, open up a
07:09:04.798 new div with a class name background
07:09:08.080 white rounded large
07:09:10.520 and
07:09:12.680 border. Inside of here, open a new div
07:09:16.000 with a class name px4 py 5 gap y of 5
07:09:20.958 flex flex column and call span of five.
07:09:26.080 Inside of here, a div with a class
07:09:29.160 name flex items center and gap x of
07:09:33.878 three. Let's render our generated avatar
07:09:36.878 component, which is a self-closing tag.
07:09:39.520 Make sure you have imported it from
07:09:41.440 components generated
07:09:43.878 avatar. Go ahead and give it a variant
07:09:47.040 of bots neutral and a seed of data name
07:09:51.680 and a class name of size
07:09:54.600 10. Below it an H2 element rendering the
07:09:57.920 data
07:10:00.440 name. Give the H2 element a class name
07:10:04.558 text to Excel and font
07:10:06.920 medium like this.
07:10:10.240 And outside of this
07:10:12.760 div, render a
07:10:15.400 badge from components UI badge. So make
07:10:18.798 sure you import it from here and not
07:10:20.958 from Lucid React because sometimes u
07:10:24.160 IntelliSense imports it from there. Give
07:10:27.040 this batch here a variant of outline and
07:10:30.478 a class name of flex item center gap x2.
07:10:34.718 Target the SVG and give it a size of
07:10:37.520 four inside. Render the video
07:10:41.000 icon. Make sure you have it from Lucid
07:10:46.120 React and go ahead and render data
07:10:49.760 meeting count. So inside of our
07:10:53.240 procedures get one, we added meeting
07:10:56.000 count in the select with a mock number
07:10:58.240 five. So later we're going to change it
07:11:00.160 to the actual meeting count, but I'm
07:11:02.240 just showing you this in case you don't
07:11:03.760 have it. You need to add it so that you
07:11:05.920 can access it here in the agent ID view.
07:11:08.958 So now that you have the meeting count
07:11:10.638 here, go ahead and check if data meeting
07:11:14.080 count is equal to one. Render meeting
07:11:18.600 otherwise meetings like this. There we
07:11:21.840 go. Outside of this, render a div with a
07:11:25.520 class
07:11:26.760 name flex flex column. Yeah, y of four
07:11:31.200 and two
07:11:32.280 paragraphs. First one with the label
07:11:35.878 instructions and the bottom one with the
07:11:39.280 actual data instructions.
07:11:42.878 Give this one a class name of text large
07:11:45.760 and font
07:11:47.240 medium. And this one a class name of
07:11:50.080 text neutral
07:11:54.520 800. And there we go. Now let's just
07:11:58.000 give this video icon here a class name
07:12:00.958 of text blue
07:12:03.718 700. Perfect. So this is our agent view.
07:12:07.840 You can see that it matches exactly what
07:12:09.840 we see here, but in a different layout.
07:12:12.638 And now in the next chapter, we will be
07:12:14.798 able to edit it and to delete it. Great.
07:12:19.040 Amazing. I think that's all we wanted to
07:12:21.360 do here. Let's just see this error that
07:12:23.440 I'm having here. It looks like I'm not
07:12:26.360 using more vertical. That's right.
07:12:29.280 Because I'm using the more vertical
07:12:30.878 icon. Okay. So, basically, I added an
07:12:34.000 invalid import here. Perfect. So I think
07:12:37.680 that's it for this chapter. Everything
07:12:40.160 seems to be working just fine. Uh and
07:12:42.718 obviously this is not in sync now. This
07:12:44.958 shows six and this shows five. So I'm
07:12:48.798 going to change that later when we
07:12:50.240 actually do the proper
07:12:52.120 calculation. So we've added this and
07:12:54.478 we've added this. And now let's merge
07:12:57.958 this. So I'm going to go ahead and
07:13:00.558 create a new branch with the name 14
07:13:02.638 agent page.
07:13:07.680 I'm going to stage all changes once I am
07:13:10.718 on the new page.
07:13:12.280 Here I will add a commit
07:13:16.120 message and I will publish the
07:13:19.798 branch. And now let's go ahead and open
07:13:23.280 a pull
07:13:26.440 request. And let's see what our code
07:13:29.280 reviewer has to say.
07:13:32.558 And now let's read our code summary. We
07:13:36.080 introduced a detailed agent view page
07:13:38.240 with loading and error handling states.
07:13:40.638 We added a header component for the
07:13:42.400 agent date detail view featuring
07:13:44.798 breadcrumb navigation and an action menu
07:13:47.440 with edit and delete options. We enabled
07:13:50.558 navigation to an agents detail page by
07:13:53.200 clicking on a row in the agents list. We
07:13:56.080 also improve data security by ensuring
07:13:58.320 only agents owned by the current user
07:14:00.478 can be accessed. So this is referring to
07:14:03.280 us modifying the get one procedure. In
07:14:06.718 here we have a more in-depth walk
07:14:09.120 through. We have a short sequence
07:14:11.360 diagram explaining how when the user
07:14:13.200 clicks on an agent row, we access the
07:14:15.360 agent view. We use router push agents
07:14:18.558 agent ID to get to the agent detail
07:14:21.360 page. In here we load the agent detail
07:14:23.920 page using a react server component and
07:14:27.120 then we do the uh we basically fetch the
07:14:30.958 agent data later on but we have it in
07:14:33.280 the cache so it's much faster and then
07:14:35.680 we return agent data or error and
07:14:38.558 depending on that we show either the
07:14:40.958 agent details loading or the error
07:14:44.120 UI and it also noticed a related PR here
07:14:47.760 for our agents setup. So it's pretty
07:14:49.760 cool how it keeps context of all of our
07:14:53.440 previous work. So it knows what we are
07:14:56.478 actually
07:14:57.320 developing. And in here uh we have a
07:15:00.558 request from them to uh verify that we
07:15:04.558 know what we are doing because we set
07:15:06.160 the model to false. So you can see that
07:15:08.240 when you add a comment uh it doesn't
07:15:10.878 tell you that you made a mistake. It
07:15:12.718 just asks you to verify. So pretty nice
07:15:16.080 uh noticing of the comment here. And of
07:15:19.040 course, it tells us to add a proper
07:15:21.040 comment here to implement this and not
07:15:23.760 just leave it like that. And that's
07:15:25.520 exactly what we will do in the next
07:15:27.320 chapter. So, let's go ahead and merge
07:15:29.760 this pull request. And once you've done
07:15:32.558 that, go ahead inside of your main and
07:15:36.638 synchronize the changes. After that, go
07:15:40.478 inside of your source control, open the
07:15:43.440 graph and confirm that you have just
07:15:45.760 merged 14 agent page. Perfect. Amazing.
07:15:50.558 Amazing job. And see you in the next
07:15:54.760 chapter. In this chapter, we are going
07:15:57.360 to implement update and delete
07:15:59.440 functionality for an individual agent.
07:16:02.240 This will include adding agents.
07:16:04.958 procedure, agents.update update
07:16:07.240 procedure and the actual edit and delete
07:16:11.558 UI. So, let's start with adding these
07:16:14.600 procedures. As always, ensure that
07:16:17.040 you're on your default branch and feel
07:16:19.680 free to synchronize the changes to
07:16:21.920 ensure that you're up to
07:16:24.200 date. After that, let's head inside of
07:16:26.798 our modules agents server and inside of
07:16:30.478 the procedures and let's implement the
07:16:33.680 remove procedure. So this will be a
07:16:37.200 protected
07:16:38.600 procedure and it's going to have a input
07:16:42.400 of
07:16:44.120 Z.Object and simply accept ID which is a
07:16:47.600 type of
07:16:49.080 string. Add a
07:16:51.240 mutation destructure the context and the
07:16:55.718 input. Let's go ahead and get the
07:16:58.718 removed agent here by using await
07:17:02.000 database.delete
07:17:03.478 delete
07:17:05.558 agents where
07:17:08.520 do and go ahead and add and the first
07:17:12.718 one will match the agents ID for the
07:17:15.600 input ID and the second one will confirm
07:17:18.798 that the agent's user ID is the
07:17:21.520 currently logged in user so that only we
07:17:25.280 can remove this user and no one else go
07:17:28.798 ahead and add returning here if there is
07:17:32.160 no moved agent here. Throw new TRPC
07:17:36.680 error code not found with a message
07:17:40.878 agent not
07:17:44.280 found otherwise return the removed agent
07:17:48.080 back to the client. Perfect. Now let's
07:17:51.440 go ahead inside of our modules agent
07:17:54.680 schemas and in here let's export con
07:17:58.638 agents
07:18:00.440 update schema and let's reuse the agents
07:18:04.638 insert schema and simply extend it by
07:18:08.638 also requiring an ID. Give it a minimum
07:18:13.040 length and a message ID is
07:18:18.200 required like this. Now let's go back
07:18:21.440 inside of our procedures here and let's
07:18:25.440 implement the update protected
07:18:28.840 procedure. So the update protected
07:18:31.600 procedure will have an input of agents
07:18:34.878 update schema. Make sure to add this
07:18:38.920 import and in here add a mutation
07:18:43.958 asynchronous destructure the context and
07:18:47.040 the input here. Let me just move this
07:18:49.920 comma to this place. And you can obtain
07:18:53.600 the updated agent here by using await
07:18:56.718 database update
07:18:59.558 agents.
07:19:01.080 Set everything in the input where
07:19:05.958 and you can just copy the same logic as
07:19:09.920 here. So the matching agent ID with the
07:19:14.080 matching author and make sure to put
07:19:16.558 returning here. If there is no updated
07:19:20.440 agent, you can throw the same error as
07:19:23.760 here. Agent not found. And then return
07:19:27.600 updated agent. And just like that, we
07:19:30.478 have implemented our procedures. Let's
07:19:32.958 go ahead and mark them as complete.
07:19:35.760 Now let's go ahead and implement the
07:19:37.440 delete UI as it is a bit simpler. So
07:19:41.840 what I want to do is I want to go inside
07:19:43.680 of an individual agent here and I want
07:19:46.160 to go inside of the agent ID view. So
07:19:50.000 inside of modules agents UI views agent
07:19:54.558 id
07:19:56.200 view. And in here let's go ahead and
07:19:58.798 prepare some things. Let's set the
07:20:01.200 router to be use router from next
07:20:03.840 navigation.
07:20:05.520 And let's add query client to be use
07:20:08.160 query client front stack react query. So
07:20:12.080 I'm just going to move this here. There
07:20:13.840 we go. Make sure you have added use
07:20:15.280 query client and use router from next
07:20:17.400 navigation. And then what we're going to
07:20:19.520 do is we're going to add a remove agent
07:20:22.040 method by using use mutation. So make
07:20:25.440 sure you have imported use mutation from
07:20:27.600 tanstack react query. Inside of the use
07:20:31.240 mutation, go ahead and pass
07:20:36.600 TRPC.agents. And open up mutation
07:20:40.280 options. Inside of the mutation options
07:20:43.280 here, oh, and let's just see. Uh, looks
07:20:46.718 like I have accidentally been
07:20:49.080 doing this. Let me just fix this. Use
07:20:52.080 mutation. Use query client. Use suspense
07:20:53.920 query. Okay. Uh, I think that's all I
07:20:56.958 need. Yes, perfect. So let's go back
07:20:59.440 inside of the remove agent here and
07:21:01.520 let's add on success here to do the
07:21:04.320 following. Let's use query client
07:21:06.558 invalidate queries. And the first thing
07:21:08.878 we want to invalidate is our get
07:21:12.840 many and add query options here and pass
07:21:16.320 in an empty object
07:21:18.120 inside. Then I want to invalidate
07:21:21.840 uh something that we don't yet have. So
07:21:24.878 I'm just going to add a comment to do
07:21:26.600 invalidate preier
07:21:30.040 usage. And after we've done that, let's
07:21:33.520 do
07:21:35.240 router.push forward slash agents like
07:21:39.040 this. And you can mark this as async.
07:21:41.200 And then you can mark this as a wait. So
07:21:43.520 it will push after it invalidates the
07:21:45.718 query. And on error
07:21:48.760 here obtain the error and do a toast
07:21:52.798 which you can import from
07:21:55.240 soner. So move it here toast dot error
07:21:59.360 error dot
07:22:01.638 message and just like that you have
07:22:04.000 implemented the remove agent method. So
07:22:07.520 if you want to technically you could
07:22:10.160 already uh call on remove here. So you
07:22:14.000 could do remove agent mutate and pass in
07:22:18.798 the IG to be agent
07:22:21.000 ID. So for example, if you were to do
07:22:24.160 this
07:22:26.520 delete and try one more time because I
07:22:29.680 have two of them with the same name.
07:22:31.760 There we go. So there it's definitely
07:22:33.520 working, right? The problem is there is
07:22:36.080 no confirmation, right? The moment you
07:22:38.400 hit delete, it immediately deletes. So
07:22:41.440 if you if you are fine with that, no
07:22:43.600 problem. But I want to go a step further
07:22:45.840 and I want to add the confirmation
07:22:48.760 message. So let's go
07:22:51.000 ahead inside of source hooks and create
07:22:57.080 use-confirm. TS actually tsx it's
07:23:00.878 important to be
07:23:03.718 tsx. Import jsx and use state from
07:23:07.040 react.
07:23:08.798 import button from components UI button
07:23:12.320 and import responsive dialogue. Let's
07:23:15.360 export
07:23:19.400 const. We will accept a title which is a
07:23:22.400 type of string and a description which
07:23:24.558 is a type of string and we are going to
07:23:27.120 return the
07:23:29.000 following a
07:23:31.638 JSX.element
07:23:33.240 and a promise unknown.
07:23:38.160 Let's go ahead and return that now.
07:23:40.718 First of all, let's set the promise and
07:23:42.878 set promise to be use state here and
07:23:46.478 let's set it to null by default. Let's
07:23:49.200 give the use state a following value.
07:23:52.558 Open an object and write resolve a
07:23:57.120 function which accepts the value which
07:23:59.040 is a boolean and returns a void. So it
07:24:02.478 can either be that instead of an object
07:24:05.878 or it can be null. There we go. So
07:24:09.760 that's our promise state. Now let's add
07:24:13.040 the
07:24:14.280 confirm
07:24:16.200 method in here. Very simply return new
07:24:20.360 promise. Grab the resolve from here and
07:24:24.160 set promise to
07:24:26.760 resolve like this.
07:24:31.280 Then do const handle close in here. Set
07:24:34.878 promise to be
07:24:37.798 null. Create a const handle
07:24:41.000 confirm. In here check if the promise
07:24:44.080 exists and resolve it with true and do a
07:24:48.400 handle
07:24:50.440 close. And finally let's do con handle
07:24:56.120 cancel which is an explicit no. So let's
07:24:59.920 resolve this
07:25:02.600 whoops with false and handle close. So
07:25:07.120 we are basically creating a system where
07:25:09.760 the user can answer yes or no for a
07:25:13.280 specific action and the you and then a
07:25:16.400 developer will be able to await the
07:25:18.958 result from this hook and get either
07:25:21.680 true or false and depending on that we
07:25:24.478 can call the delete method or we can
07:25:26.798 close the model. for example. So, it's
07:25:29.360 going to be a highly reusable hook for
07:25:32.240 asking the user for
07:25:34.040 confirmation. And let's now do a const
07:25:37.600 confirmation dialogue
07:25:39.638 here. And let's actually render this.
07:25:43.040 So, responsive dialogue like
07:25:46.840 this. Let's pass in the open to be
07:25:49.958 promise not null. on open change to be
07:25:53.920 handle
07:25:55.240 close. Title will be title. Description
07:25:59.360 will be
07:26:01.000 description. Inside of it, open a div
07:26:04.638 with a class name adding top four full
07:26:08.240 width flex flex column flex column
07:26:14.040 reverse gap Y of two LG flex
07:26:18.840 row. My apologies. This is not flex
07:26:21.600 call. Remove this. So just flex column
07:26:24.160 reverse. But on large devices it's going
07:26:26.558 to be flex row gap x2 items center and
07:26:31.680 justify end. Inside of here add a
07:26:36.360 button cancel. And below it
07:26:41.080 confirm. For the cancel button, give it
07:26:43.760 an on click of handle
07:26:45.958 cancel variant of outline class name of
07:26:50.958 full width on LG with
07:26:54.200 auto in here. Let's copy these
07:26:56.878 attributes and paste them here. Change
07:26:58.638 the on click to be handle confirm.
07:27:00.958 Remove the variant and just leave the
07:27:03.200 class
07:27:04.200 name. And finally, return the confirm
07:27:07.520 dialogue and the confirm method in an
07:27:10.600 array. And you should have no errors
07:27:13.280 here because we correctly matched all
07:27:15.840 the types here. So let's finally see how
07:27:19.360 this will be used. Agent ID view. Let's
07:27:23.200 go back
07:27:24.120 here and let's go ahead now and do the
07:27:28.558 following. So after remove agent, let's
07:27:31.360 do const use
07:27:34.760 confirm from hooks use
07:27:39.000 confirm. And let's go ahead and give the
07:27:41.760 first prop. Are you sure? And let's go
07:27:45.520 ahead and
07:27:46.680 do description. The following action
07:27:50.478 will remove. And let's do data dot
07:27:54.320 meeting count
07:27:57.240 associated meetings. So when you remove
07:27:59.440 an agent, we're also going to remove all
07:28:01.280 meetings associated with that agent. So
07:28:03.600 we want to let the user know that. In
07:28:06.160 here, grab the remove confirmation and
07:28:09.840 confirm remove
07:28:11.638 method and then create const handle
07:28:15.120 remove agent
07:28:17.478 method. Grab it. Make it an asynchronous
07:28:20.478 method and then you will get the okay
07:28:23.200 from await confirm remove. And this
07:28:26.478 confirm remove will open the remove
07:28:29.798 confirmation and only if the user
07:28:32.398 pressed okay are we going to continue
07:28:35.440 forward. So if not okay break the method
07:28:38.478 otherwise call await remove agent mutate
07:28:42.680 async and pass in ID agent
07:28:46.600 id and then go ahead and put this
07:28:51.240 here and wrap the entire thing inside of
07:28:55.440 square
07:28:57.200 uh the entire thing inside of a fragment
07:28:59.440 and render the remove confirmation
07:29:02.360 here and you should have no errors now.
07:29:06.160 And now let's go ahead and click on an
07:29:08.398 agent and let's try and remove it only
07:29:10.798 if you click confirm. And you will see
07:29:12.558 it says five associated meetings because
07:29:14.478 that's what we currently mock. So if I
07:29:16.958 click cancel, nothing happens. But if I
07:29:20.160 click
07:29:21.398 confirm, it deletes the agent. Exactly
07:29:24.878 what we
07:29:26.120 wanted. Now let's implement the update
07:29:29.120 agent dialogue. So, let's go inside of
07:29:32.000 our agent UI components and let's copy
07:29:35.520 the new agent dialogue and let's paste
07:29:38.000 it here and let's rename it update-
07:29:41.520 agent- dialogue. Before you edit it,
07:29:44.798 just double check that you are inside of
07:29:46.638 it, that you're not accidentally inside
07:29:48.558 of new agent dialogue. Close that and go
07:29:50.718 inside of update agent dialogue. The
07:29:53.360 good news is we made our agent form
07:29:56.478 editable. So it will also edit as much
07:30:00.320 as it will create for the first time.
07:30:02.558 The problem is we don't have the update
07:30:06.080 uh agent mutate added here. So that's
07:30:08.160 the only thing we're going to have to
07:30:10.600 modify. So now go back to the update
07:30:13.520 agent dialogue and let's rename this
07:30:16.320 from new agent dialogue to update agent
07:30:20.160 dialogue. Change the title to edit
07:30:23.280 agent. And this will be
07:30:26.360 edit the agent details like this. And
07:30:31.280 the only difference here is that we're
07:30:33.120 going to have initial values here. And
07:30:35.920 that will be a type of agent get one
07:30:38.638 from the types. And it will be required,
07:30:40.878 right? You cannot edit these if you
07:30:43.920 can't load the initial values here. So
07:30:46.878 go ahead and pass the initial values
07:30:48.638 which are optional for the agent form
07:30:50.638 because it can be used both with or
07:30:52.558 without
07:30:55.160 them. So let's pass them
07:30:59.000 here. Now let's go inside of the agent
07:31:03.080 form and let's copy the create agent
07:31:06.280 here and let's paste it here. Let's
07:31:10.160 rename it update agent and let's use the
07:31:13.920 RPC agents.update.
07:31:15.798 update and let's see what we have to do
07:31:18.240 on success here. So we have to
07:31:20.478 invalidate the queries get many that's
07:31:22.878 true and then we have to
07:31:25.878 invalidate the get one because we just
07:31:28.958 updated that individual one and in here
07:31:32.638 this is also true. So if the error code
07:31:35.920 is forbidden we redirect to upgrade. I'm
07:31:38.398 going to leave this purposely on to-do
07:31:40.798 because if we implement it now, sure,
07:31:43.280 it's going to work, but I want us to
07:31:45.280 wait until we actually implement
07:31:46.878 upgrades. So, it all makes more sense
07:31:48.718 when it happens, right? Uh, great. So,
07:31:51.440 that's our update agent. And now that I
07:31:54.240 look at it, our create agent actually
07:31:56.958 does not need to invalidate get one
07:32:00.558 because at this point, it will never
07:32:03.200 exist in the cache. So, our create agent
07:32:05.440 doesn't need to do that. But let's add a
07:32:07.680 to-do invalidate free tier usage in the
07:32:11.520 future when we have it. We don't have it
07:32:13.760 yet, but we're going to have to do this
07:32:15.600 for the free tier TRPC route. We now
07:32:18.718 have the update agent, which means that
07:32:21.760 we can now go inside of is pending and
07:32:26.160 add it here. So update agent is
07:32:30.600 pending and in here instead of a console
07:32:33.280 log we can now do update agent.mmutate
07:32:36.440 here spread the values and also add ID
07:32:39.840 from the initial
07:32:41.718 values do ID there we go and I think
07:32:45.760 that's all we need right because I think
07:32:48.080 this will already show update so now we
07:32:50.878 have to go back to the agent ID view
07:32:53.558 here and we have to add a state. So
07:32:57.040 let's
07:32:58.040 import use state from
07:33:01.878 React. Great. And let's just add this
07:33:05.200 field here. Update agent dialogue open
07:33:08.080 and set update agent dialogue open from
07:33:10.638 new state with a default of
07:33:13.160 false. And what we're going to do now is
07:33:16.160 simply below the remove confirmation,
07:33:18.160 let's add the update agent dialogue. So
07:33:21.600 make sure to import
07:33:24.760 it. And now let's go ahead and just pass
07:33:27.600 some props to it here. So that's going
07:33:29.520 to be open update agent dialogue open on
07:33:34.878 open change set update agent dialogue
07:33:37.718 open. And the initial values will be the
07:33:40.718 data. And there we go. Now on edit
07:33:44.478 modify this in the header to be set
07:33:47.040 update agent dialog open to be true.
07:33:50.878 and let's try it out. So, make sure you
07:33:53.440 have at least one agent. This one is
07:33:54.878 called a new agent. I will click edit
07:33:57.360 here. And there we go. You can see how
07:33:59.440 it autofilled all information and it
07:34:02.558 says edit and it says update. So, a
07:34:06.240 updated agent. 1 2 3. Let's try this.
07:34:09.920 Let's click update. And the moment of
07:34:12.798 truth. There we go. Seems to be working
07:34:16.160 just fine. And this is invalidated as
07:34:18.878 well. Amazing. We have officially
07:34:22.000 wrapped up our agents entity. The only
07:34:24.798 thing left is to properly count the
07:34:26.878 meetings. We're going to do that after
07:34:28.798 we add the meetings schema. Amazing. So,
07:34:32.160 let's go ahead and see what we have to
07:34:33.878 do. We added edit UI and delete UI. And
07:34:37.520 now, let's merge this pull
07:34:39.798 request. So, I'm going to go inside of
07:34:41.920 my graph as usual. I'm going to click on
07:34:44.558 my branch. I will create a new
07:34:47.798 branch 15 agent update and delete. So 15
07:34:52.000 agent update
07:34:54.040 delete. Once I'm on the new branch, I
07:34:57.120 will click plus to stage all the
07:34:59.000 changes. And I will write a commit
07:35:03.000 message. And let's click commit and
07:35:06.000 publish branch. There we go. And then
07:35:09.680 let's go to
07:35:10.920 GitHub. Let's open a pull request
07:35:14.440 here. and let's see what our reviewer
07:35:18.000 has to
07:35:19.798 say. So, let's see what we've done in
07:35:22.798 this pull request. We added the ability
07:35:25.200 to edit and remove agents, including the
07:35:27.760 edit agent dialogue and confirmation
07:35:30.240 prompts before removal. We introduced a
07:35:33.280 reusable confirmation dialogue for
07:35:35.120 asynchronous user confirmations. This
07:35:37.360 was exactly the goal with the use
07:35:39.200 confirm hook. We had some improvements
07:35:42.160 like enhancing the agent form to handle
07:35:44.558 both creation and updating of the agents
07:35:47.520 with improved success and error
07:35:50.120 handling. Perfect. In here we have a
07:35:52.638 more in-depth walk through. And in here
07:35:55.440 we have a sequence diagram explaining
07:35:58.080 our uh editing dialogues and our
07:36:02.040 confirmation removal dialogue right here
07:36:05.120 in case you are interested.
07:36:07.760 And in here uh we also have a related PR
07:36:12.160 agent page from our chapter 14. And we
07:36:16.398 do have some comments here. So this one
07:36:19.200 recommends checking if the promise
07:36:20.958 exists and resolving it. But we don't
07:36:22.958 have to do that because uh we do that uh
07:36:26.638 using a different method. We do it using
07:36:28.638 on cancel. So close by itself should not
07:36:32.878 uh resolve the promise. That's why it's
07:36:35.440 okay to do it this way. Okay. So, I'm
07:36:37.200 just going to resolve this. And in here,
07:36:39.760 it simply tells us to track and resolve
07:36:43.600 those to-dos in a future pull request.
07:36:47.120 And we definitely will. Perfect. So,
07:36:50.958 that's it for the comments. And let's
07:36:52.638 merge this pull request. And after
07:36:56.080 you've merged the pull request, you can
07:36:58.478 go back to your main branch, whatever is
07:37:00.958 your default branch, and synchronize the
07:37:03.440 changes. And as always, go inside of
07:37:07.200 your source control graph and confirm
07:37:10.080 that you just merged that. And here we
07:37:12.558 have our use confirm hook. Perfect. That
07:37:15.760 wraps up this chapter. Amazing job and
07:37:18.478 see you in the next
07:37:20.760 one. In this chapter, we are going to
07:37:23.600 implement the meetings into our project.
07:37:27.200 This chapter will include setting up the
07:37:29.760 schema module procedures and the
07:37:33.120 meetings pages. So let's start with our
07:37:36.440 schema. As always, ensure that you're on
07:37:39.280 your main default branch and go ahead
07:37:41.840 and synchronize changes just to make
07:37:44.160 sure everything is up to date. After
07:37:46.558 that, go inside of database schema. And
07:37:49.600 in here, to make things easier, let's
07:37:51.680 copy our agents schema. Let's paste it.
07:37:55.040 Let's rename this to meetings. Let's
07:37:58.240 rename the actual table name to
07:38:00.080 meetings. Here the ID field stays
07:38:03.120 exactly the same. The name as well, user
07:38:06.000 ID reference exactly the same. And then
07:38:08.958 we can copy the user ID reference and
07:38:11.280 simply add the agent ID reference. And
07:38:13.920 make sure to name this table agent ID.
07:38:18.080 And the reference will be to the agents
07:38:20.718 do ID
07:38:22.600 table. Besides the agent reference which
07:38:25.840 also has the ondelete cascade meaning if
07:38:28.398 an agent is deleted this meeting will be
07:38:30.638 deleted too. Let's also add a status.
07:38:34.478 Now the status will be a special enum
07:38:37.040 which we have to create. So let's go
07:38:38.878 above here and create a con meeting
07:38:41.520 status to be a type of pgnum from
07:38:44.320 drizzle or pg
07:38:47.638 core. Inside of here, let's go ahead and
07:38:50.718 add
07:38:51.958 meeting status and open an
07:38:55.320 array. In here, we're going to set
07:38:58.680 upcoming, active,
07:39:01.878 completed,
07:39:03.798 processing, and
07:39:06.120 cancelled. Now, we can use the meeting
07:39:08.320 status as our type for the status here.
07:39:12.240 meeting status, column name status,
07:39:16.200 required and default
07:39:18.840 upcoming like this. We are not going to
07:39:21.920 have instructions but what we will have
07:39:26.000 oops what we will have is the started
07:39:31.958 at and ended at timestamps. So make sure
07:39:36.718 to fix this. This will be started
07:39:40.280 at this will be ended at and they will
07:39:45.360 not be required and we are not going to
07:39:47.840 default them. So just timestamps like
07:39:52.600 this besides that let's also add
07:39:55.520 transcript URL which is a type of text
07:39:58.760 transcript URL. Copy and paste this and
07:40:01.920 make a recording
07:40:04.680 URL and add recording URL here as well.
07:40:08.958 And last one will be the summary which
07:40:10.958 is a type of text
07:40:13.080 summary. So none of these fields here
07:40:15.680 are required because all of these will
07:40:17.840 exist only after we switch to completed
07:40:22.080 mode. Right? Only after the meeting has
07:40:24.240 been had will we be able to append the
07:40:27.520 proper status. started at, ended at,
07:40:30.000 transcript URL, recording URL, and the
07:40:33.160 summary. Great. So, make sure you have
07:40:35.200 the agent reference. Make sure you
07:40:36.958 didn't forget to change the name of any
07:40:38.878 column here. Make sure none of them are
07:40:41.478 repeating. And now, let's go ahead and
07:40:44.638 push this to the
07:40:46.840 database. So, I'm going to go ahead and
07:40:49.280 do mpm run database push like this. And
07:40:53.680 this will add the new schema to our
07:41:00.440 database. And I seem to be having an
07:41:03.120 error here. Meeting
07:41:05.478 status does not
07:41:07.798 exist. So let's see what I did
07:41:11.360 incorrectly here. So pgnium meeting
07:41:14.638 status. Uh first of all, let's also add
07:41:16.398 export cons here. I think we need to do
07:41:19.280 this as well simply because we are using
07:41:21.760 the entire schema in some places. Uh but
07:41:25.360 let's just save this file. Let's shut
07:41:27.360 down our app and let's try
07:41:33.958 again. There we go. So, I'm not sure
07:41:36.798 which one of these changes did it. Maybe
07:41:39.840 it was the export. Maybe it was just
07:41:41.680 saving the file again and shutting down
07:41:43.600 the app. But yeah, just try one of those
07:41:46.000 and try npm run database push again and
07:41:48.878 uh no reason at all for this to fail.
07:41:52.240 Great. So now we have added our meetings
07:41:55.360 schema. Now let's go ahead and let's add
07:41:57.520 the meetings pages and the meetings
07:41:59.958 module. So I'm going to go inside of
07:42:02.000 source app folder dashboard and I'm
07:42:05.440 going to add meetings here and inside a
07:42:09.120 page.
07:42:11.080 DSX page div meetings
07:42:15.478 page just like this. And inside of here,
07:42:19.520 let's add individual meeting ID page DSX
07:42:24.718 another page here and a div meeting ID
07:42:28.320 page. There we go. So now that we have
07:42:31.600 added this, we can go ahead and do npm
07:42:33.920 rundev on our app again. And we can go
07:42:36.958 to localhost 3000 here. Wait for it to
07:42:41.080 load and we can now click on the
07:42:43.360 meetings and we will see the meetings
07:42:45.360 page. And if I manually change my URL to
07:42:49.320 forward/meings123, I will see the
07:42:51.040 meeting ID page. So let's go back to the
07:42:53.680 meetings page. And now let's implement
07:42:56.160 our module so that we can actually see
07:42:58.478 the JSON of our data. So let's go inside
07:43:01.760 of modules here. Let's create meetings.
07:43:05.120 And inside of here, let's create the
07:43:07.440 server module. and inside
07:43:10.280 procedures. DS, let's keep our agents
07:43:13.920 server procedures open so we can copy
07:43:16.000 and paste and speed things up. So let's
07:43:18.320 start by copying everything and pasting
07:43:20.398 in in the new meetings procedures here.
07:43:23.120 And let's rename this to be meetings
07:43:26.280 router. And for now let's remove update
07:43:29.280 and let's remove basically all except
07:43:32.160 get one and except get many. So that's
07:43:35.760 the only thing we are interested in. We
07:43:38.160 are later going to adapt the create,
07:43:40.958 update, remove and uh similar ones.
07:43:44.798 There we go. So meetings router. Now
07:43:46.718 let's go ahead and improve the get one
07:43:48.878 procedure here. So get one is a
07:43:51.280 protected procedure. It's looking for
07:43:52.958 ID. Instead of existing agent, it will
07:43:55.280 be existing meeting
07:43:57.878 here and it's not going to have a
07:44:00.160 meeting count. So you can remove that
07:44:02.000 and you can leave this as it is and it
07:44:04.240 will be from meetings.
07:44:06.958 So you have to change meetings in all
07:44:08.558 instances here. The easiest way to do
07:44:10.160 that is to simply remove the agents
07:44:12.000 imports. You will have errors and you
07:44:14.160 will know all the places you have to fix
07:44:16.680 things. There we go. So everything's
07:44:19.040 exactly the same. Existing
07:44:21.398 meeting, existing meeting and meeting
07:44:24.718 not found for the get many similar.
07:44:28.398 Let's go ahead and remove this. Leave
07:44:31.200 this to be meetings from meetings.
07:44:34.958 meetings user ID meetings name equals
07:44:37.520 the search order by meetings created at
07:44:40.478 meetings ID and the total is counting
07:44:43.360 the meetings with the same query here so
07:44:46.718 luckily the fields are exactly the same
07:44:48.478 so we don't have any issues here
07:44:49.958 whatsoever and we can remove the SQL
07:44:52.320 import here we go so we have a dead
07:44:55.600 simple um get many and get one
07:44:59.120 procedures here now what we have to do
07:45:01.680 is we have to go inside of the RPC
07:45:04.240 router
07:45:05.360 And we have to add meetings router from
07:45:09.280 modules meetings server procedures and
07:45:11.280 call this meetings like
07:45:14.200 this. Now let's go to our page tsx
07:45:18.638 inside of our meetings here. And in here
07:45:22.160 let's return meetings view.
07:45:26.558 Let's build the meetings view quickly by
07:45:29.120 going inside of our modules meetings and
07:45:32.558 let's create the UI folder. Let's create
07:45:35.520 the views folder and let's create
07:45:38.360 meetings-view tsx market as use client
07:45:42.398 export const meetings view like
07:45:45.958 this. And inside of here go ahead and do
07:45:50.638 the following. Prepare TRPC from use
07:45:54.080 DRPC from the client. Prepare data from
07:45:58.160 use
07:45:59.398 query from tan stack create query. Pass
07:46:02.478 in the TRPC meetings get many query
07:46:06.878 options and simply pass an empty object
07:46:09.958 here. And in here do JSON stringify data
07:46:14.478 question mark dot
07:46:18.120 items like this. or you can actually
07:46:20.638 stringify the whole beta, right? It
07:46:22.878 doesn't
07:46:23.798 matter. Now let's go to the page and
07:46:26.080 let's import meetings view from modules
07:46:28.320 meetings UI views meetings view. So now
07:46:32.160 when you hit the meetings page, you will
07:46:34.718 see the empty state right
07:46:37.878 here. Now let's go ahead and just add
07:46:41.120 some data here. So you can either visit
07:46:43.360 the Neon console or you can visit the
07:46:45.680 Drizzle Studio here. So we can go inside
07:46:47.760 of our project here. go inside of the
07:46:49.920 tables and let's just add something.
07:46:52.240 Again, if for whatever reason you can't
07:46:54.320 do this, no worries because we're going
07:46:55.920 to create the uh the form for creating
07:46:58.240 meetings in the next chapter. So, go
07:46:59.840 inside of meetings, add record. Um yeah,
07:47:03.680 you would now need to uh let's discard
07:47:07.040 the changes. So, you need to have at
07:47:09.040 least one agent and just, you
07:47:11.798 know, paste the ID here. Grab a user,
07:47:16.160 for example, whoever you are logged in
07:47:18.080 with, right? And just paste that user ID
07:47:20.958 here. And then go inside of your
07:47:23.040 meetings and add a new record. For the
07:47:25.040 ID, you can just write demo. For the
07:47:27.760 name, this can be first meeting. And
07:47:30.160 then for the user ID, you will copy your
07:47:32.240 user ID and add it here. For the agent
07:47:35.520 ID, copy it and add it here as well. And
07:47:39.440 for the status, you can use the default.
07:47:41.200 And I don't think you have to fill
07:47:42.878 anything else here. So just click save
07:47:44.798 change. There we go. And now we have
07:47:47.280 proper relations with that user and with
07:47:50.558 that agent. Again, if you fail at doing
07:47:52.878 this, no problem at all. We will create
07:47:54.958 it in the next chapter, the actual form
07:47:57.040 for doing this. But there we go. You can
07:47:59.200 see that it works. We can now see our
07:48:01.280 data here. Perfect. So what I want to do
07:48:05.360 now is I also want to enable the
07:48:09.360 prefetching here just so we don't have
07:48:12.240 to do it later. So let's go ahead and do
07:48:15.280 the following inside of our meetings
07:48:18.040 page. Let's go ahead and let's grab the
07:48:20.478 query client using get query client like
07:48:25.120 this.
07:48:29.040 Let's execute it and let's do void
07:48:32.840 queryclient dot prefetch query and
07:48:36.478 inside pass in tRPC from tRPC
07:48:39.878 server meetings get many and pass in an
07:48:44.398 empty
07:48:45.240 object for the query options like this.
07:48:49.920 So now we are prefetching that. Now
07:48:52.320 let's go ahead and let's add our
07:48:53.840 hydration boundary from tanstack react
07:48:56.240 query in here. Let's add the state to be
07:48:59.878 dehydrate from tanstack react query and
07:49:02.718 pass in the query client like that.
07:49:05.440 There we go. Now our page is hydrated
07:49:09.600 and prefetched. So what's missing is the
07:49:12.320 suspense here from
07:49:14.760 react and besides
07:49:17.398 suspense the error boundary from react
07:49:22.080 error boundary.
07:49:26.558 Now let's go inside of the meetings view
07:49:28.638 here and let's borrow from our uh agents
07:49:35.080 module UI views agents view. Let's copy
07:49:40.160 agents view loading and agents view
07:49:42.878 error and let's paste it inside of our
07:49:44.638 new meetings view. So let's rename both
07:49:47.280 of these well all of these instances to
07:49:50.638 meetings. So, meetings view loading
07:49:52.798 loading meetings meetings view error
07:49:54.638 error loading meetings and import the
07:49:57.360 loading state and import the error state
07:50:00.798 like this. There we go. And now in here
07:50:03.760 we can use a
07:50:05.240 fallback meetings view
07:50:08.360 loading and in here we can use meetings
07:50:12.878 view
07:50:14.638 error. There we go. So, I'm just going
07:50:17.280 to align all of my imports here.
07:50:20.398 There we go. Move this here. So you need
07:50:23.280 the meetings view, meetings view error
07:50:25.200 and the meetings view loading. There we
07:50:27.280 go. Which means that now in the actual
07:50:29.600 meetings view instead of using use query
07:50:31.520 you can use use suspense
07:50:33.798 query and that will trigger the
07:50:36.280 suspense. There we go. So now when you
07:50:39.200 refresh here you will see loading
07:50:40.958 meetings. And if you go ahead and try
07:50:43.440 and throw an error somewhere in here,
07:50:46.398 for example, throw new TRPC
07:50:50.280 error code bad
07:50:52.840 request and
07:50:54.920 refresh. You might encounter this
07:50:57.680 maximum uh depth infinite loop thing,
07:51:00.718 but after it settles down or after you
07:51:03.760 do a couple of refreshes and try again,
07:51:06.000 it will eventually uh simply render the
07:51:10.320 error. Let's give it a second. There we
07:51:13.360 go. Perfect. So, I think that's exactly
07:51:16.240 what we wanted to do in this chapter.
07:51:18.080 Simply introduce our meetings and
07:51:19.840 prepare the basics. And we did it quite
07:51:21.920 faster than the agents simply because we
07:51:24.080 had a lot of things to copy from. So
07:51:26.478 now, let's go ahead and let's create a
07:51:28.478 branch from this and let's merge it. So,
07:51:31.680 I'm going to create a new branch here
07:51:34.080 and I'm going to call it 16 meetings
07:51:36.878 setup. Let me just confirm that is our
07:51:39.360 topic. It is
07:51:41.320 perfect. Let's go ahead and stage all
07:51:44.600 changes and let's write our commit
07:51:47.280 message. Meetings setup. Let's click
07:51:49.760 commit and let's publish the branch.
07:51:53.080 Perfect. Now let's go to our GitHub.
07:51:56.398 Let's open up a pull request and let's
07:51:59.440 see what code rabbit has to say about
07:52:01.600 our
07:52:03.718 code. And here we have our summary. We
07:52:07.040 introduced a meetings dashboard page
07:52:08.798 with loading error and data display
07:52:11.040 states. We added a dedicated page for
07:52:13.440 viewing individual meeting details.
07:52:15.760 Meetings data is now fetched and
07:52:17.440 displayed including support for
07:52:18.958 pagination and search simply because we
07:52:21.040 copied the get menu from the agents
07:52:23.398 procedures. Perfect. So in here we have
07:52:25.840 a more in-depth walk through. And in
07:52:28.000 here we have a sequence diagram which is
07:52:30.240 identical to the one for the agents. So
07:52:32.320 we didn't have to go through it because
07:52:33.760 we didn't really add anything new. Later
07:52:36.240 when we actually add some new filters,
07:52:37.920 it will be interesting to look at how it
07:52:40.160 handles that here.
07:52:42.520 Perfect. And in here it has some
07:52:44.958 comments. Obviously, we didn't do
07:52:46.638 anything for the meeting ID page. We
07:52:48.638 will have a chapter for that. But you
07:52:50.398 can see how it knows exactly how it's
07:52:53.120 supposed to look like. So it even knows
07:52:54.878 the new TRPC syntax. This is very
07:52:57.680 impressive because it actually reads
07:52:59.360 from our code because this new TRPC
07:53:01.920 syntax is not something that AI
07:53:03.760 completion models actually know.
07:53:07.080 Perfect. Um, in here it tells us to add
07:53:10.718 pagination parameters. We will add that
07:53:12.718 later when we add the data table and all
07:53:14.798 the
07:53:16.200 filters. And in here of course it tells
07:53:18.958 us to add the actual data table. We will
07:53:21.280 do that in the next chapter.
07:53:24.160 Uh and in here it tells us to add UID
07:53:26.878 validation for get one. This is
07:53:28.878 interesting but it's actually not
07:53:30.478 correct because we are using nano ID. If
07:53:32.878 you go inside of the schema here we are
07:53:36.080 using nano ID. So using UU ID for the
07:53:38.558 validation would be incorrect in this
07:53:41.160 case. Perfect. And in here it adds some
07:53:44.718 additional validation but I'm okay with
07:53:46.878 the way we are using it right now.
07:53:49.840 Perfect. So, let's go ahead and merge
07:53:51.920 this pull request right
07:53:54.360 here. And let's go ahead and go back to
07:53:57.520 our main branch here. And let's click
07:54:00.160 synchronize changes
07:54:02.120 here. And there we go. That adds the
07:54:04.878 meetings here. Go inside of your source
07:54:07.360 control graph and confirm that you just
07:54:09.920 merged chapter 16 meetings. Amazing.
07:54:13.840 Amazing job. Let's mark this as
07:54:15.600 completed and see you in the next
07:54:17.120 chapter.
07:54:19.520 In this chapter, we're going to develop
07:54:21.440 the meetings form. So, this will include
07:54:24.478 creating the meeting list header, which
07:54:27.040 will use the text my meetings and the
07:54:29.440 new meeting button and also the actual
07:54:32.320 form where we will be able to select an
07:54:34.638 existing agent. Let's start by creating
07:54:37.520 the meetings create procedure. As
07:54:40.160 always, ensure that you're on your
07:54:41.840 default branch and that you have no
07:54:43.440 unstaged changes. Now, let's go ahead
07:54:46.558 and copy agents. server create procedure
07:54:51.920 simply so we speed things up. So I'm
07:54:54.320 going to copy the entire procedure here
07:54:56.718 and then I'm going to go inside of my
07:54:59.320 meetings server procedures and then at
07:55:02.718 the top here right above the get one I'm
07:55:05.920 going to paste the create
07:55:07.638 procedure. So now let's go ahead and
07:55:11.200 let's actually create the meetings
07:55:13.680 insert schema. So we can also help
07:55:16.638 ourselves by copying the agent schemas
07:55:19.760 and pasting it inside of meetings. Let's
07:55:22.878 rename the agents insert schema to be
07:55:25.600 meetings insert schema here. And it will
07:55:28.718 be a name and agent ID. And this will be
07:55:32.280 agent is required. And for the
07:55:37.958 meeting update schema, we are going to
07:55:40.878 extend the meetings insert
07:55:43.958 schema with an ID like this. Now we can
07:55:48.398 go back inside of the meeting server
07:55:50.080 procedures and instead of agents insert
07:55:52.478 schema, we now have it meetings insert
07:55:55.200 schema from dot dot / schemas.
07:55:59.200 Instead of having a created agent, we
07:56:01.440 are going to have created meeting in
07:56:04.958 this procedure here. And instead of
07:56:07.200 inserting agents, we will be inserting
07:56:09.280 into meetings. The input can be spread
07:56:12.240 like this. And we assign the user ID
07:56:14.680 manually. And simply return the created
07:56:17.520 meeting here. And that's it. That's all
07:56:19.760 we need for our uh create procedure for
07:56:23.440 now because there will be just one more
07:56:26.878 thing we're going to have to do here.
07:56:29.760 to do create stream call upsert stream
07:56:35.120 users. So later when we add video call
07:56:38.240 SDK, we're going to have to do that here
07:56:40.558 in the create procedure. That's why we
07:56:42.478 are adding a to-do here. Perfect. So we
07:56:45.440 can mark this as completed. Now let's
07:56:47.680 build the list header component. And we
07:56:50.478 can also help ourselves here by copying
07:56:53.440 the agents UI
07:56:55.878 components agents list header. Let's go
07:56:59.760 ahead and paste that inside of meetings
07:57:01.600 UI create a new folder called components
07:57:05.280 and paste it inside. Instead of agents
07:57:07.520 list header, this will be meetings list
07:57:09.760 header like
07:57:11.240 this. And now let's go ahead and do the
07:57:14.320 following. Let's remove the new agent
07:57:16.478 dialogue from here.
07:57:18.798 Let's remove agents search filter and
07:57:21.200 let's remove use agent filters. So we
07:57:24.160 can remove this and we can remove this
07:57:26.080 and this. Basically we're just building
07:57:28.240 the UI now. So this on click for now can
07:57:30.798 just be an empty arrow function and then
07:57:32.478 we're going to easily add it later. So
07:57:35.200 you can also remove these things here as
07:57:37.398 well to do
07:57:40.840 filters. Remove this, this, and this.
07:57:46.160 Double check that you are doing all of
07:57:47.760 these changes in the meeting list header
07:57:49.600 and not accidentally in the actual agent
07:57:51.840 list header. And now rename this
07:57:54.680 to meetings list header and this will be
07:57:57.600 my
07:58:00.520 meetings and the button will be new
07:58:03.760 meeting here. Now, let's go ahead inside
07:58:06.878 of our app folder dashboard meetings
07:58:10.558 page and let's wrap this hydration
07:58:13.520 boundary inside of a
07:58:16.760 fragment. And let's go ahead and render
07:58:19.840 the meetings list header component like
07:58:22.958 this from the
07:58:24.840 modules. And while we are here, let's
07:58:29.040 just mark this as an asynchronous
07:58:30.958 function. And let's also copy our
07:58:34.718 protection here. So let's grab the
07:58:37.120 session and let's do a redirect here. So
07:58:40.160 simply add that here in the meeting
07:58:42.000 page. So meetings page, import out from
07:58:46.798 lib out and headers from next headers
07:58:49.840 and redirect from next navigation. So
07:58:52.638 you should have all of these
07:58:55.638 added. There we go. So now our route is
07:58:59.760 protected. And when I refresh the
07:59:02.558 meetings, it should now render the
07:59:05.120 meeting list header above my JSON data
07:59:08.200 here. So we have this bug here because
07:59:12.718 it's extending our view. So what we can
07:59:15.120 do for now is go inside of the meetings
07:59:18.558 view component here and just write to-do
07:59:22.160 data table
07:59:25.160 here. And you can leave this error to
07:59:28.160 stay like that. There we go. So now you
07:59:30.558 have a much normal uh look
07:59:34.120 here. Now I want us to create the new
07:59:37.200 meeting
07:59:39.080 dialogue. Let's go ahead and copy from
07:59:42.398 the agents here in the UI components. We
07:59:46.398 have the new agent dialogue. Let's copy
07:59:49.600 that and let's put it inside of meetings
07:59:52.080 UI components. Let's go ahead and rename
07:59:54.958 this from new agent dialogue to new
07:59:57.280 meeting dialogue. Let's go ahead and
07:59:59.840 rename the instances of agent to
08:00:03.040 meeting. So new meeting dialogue. You
08:00:05.600 can remove the form import from now. And
08:00:08.000 in here you can add to-do meeting form.
08:00:12.160 Change the title to be new meeting. And
08:00:14.240 this will be create a new meeting. There
08:00:16.958 we go. Now let's go back inside of our
08:00:20.558 meetings list header here. And let's
08:00:24.240 actually render the new meeting dialogue
08:00:26.638 component fromward/ new meeting dialogue
08:00:29.600 because they are in the same components
08:00:31.200 folder in the meetings module. And now
08:00:34.160 we have to add back our use state here
08:00:38.240 is dialogue open. Set is dialogue open
08:00:40.638 from use state from react with a default
08:00:43.360 value of false. And then in here give it
08:00:46.958 an open of is dialogue open and an open
08:00:49.920 change of set is dialogue open. And in
08:00:53.280 here simply set is dialogue open to
08:00:57.080 true. So now when you click on a new
08:00:59.440 meeting you will see new meeting pop up.
08:01:01.840 And on a mobile this will be a drawer.
08:01:04.718 There we go. Now we have to implement
08:01:07.120 the meeting
08:01:08.520 form. In order to do that I also want to
08:01:11.840 add the update procedure already simply
08:01:14.718 because it's simple to do and we will
08:01:17.040 able to be complete the form both for
08:01:19.040 update and for create status. So let's
08:01:22.320 go ahead inside of modules agents server
08:01:25.718 procedures find the update procedure and
08:01:28.878 let's go ahead and copy it because it's
08:01:30.638 going to be quite similar. So now let's
08:01:33.120 go inside of our meetings server
08:01:35.680 procedures and above our create let's
08:01:38.160 now add our
08:01:39.718 copied update protected procedure. So we
08:01:43.440 can now import the meetings update
08:01:45.718 schema which we uh created a moment ago
08:01:48.958 by extending the meetings insert schema
08:01:51.080 here. Instead of updated agent agent it
08:01:54.398 will be updated meeting and we are
08:01:57.878 updating the meetings which means that
08:02:01.040 in the wear clause we are looking for a
08:02:02.958 matching meeting ID and a matching
08:02:05.440 meetings user ID. If we cannot find if
08:02:09.440 we uh we're unable to find the updated
08:02:12.080 meeting, that means that meeting does
08:02:14.080 not exist for this specific query. Maybe
08:02:17.520 the user doesn't have access to it.
08:02:19.280 We're just going to throw all of that
08:02:20.878 under not found. And let's return back
08:02:23.680 updated meeting. As simple as that. Make
08:02:26.080 sure you're using update and set here.
08:02:28.160 Perfect. So now we have the update
08:02:30.398 procedure as well which means that we
08:02:32.798 can now go inside of the agents module
08:02:35.200 UI components and we can now copy uh the
08:02:39.040 new the agent form. So let's copy the
08:02:41.920 agent form go inside of meetings UI
08:02:45.120 components paste it here and let's
08:02:47.680 rename this to meeting form and now
08:02:51.440 let's go step by step and let's simply
08:02:54.160 uh fix these things. So in here the
08:02:57.520 agent form will be meeting form. So
08:03:01.360 rename this to meeting form and use the
08:03:04.638 props here. Now let's fix the schema and
08:03:08.958 the
08:03:09.718 type. So let's go ahead and copy from
08:03:13.120 agents their types here. Let's paste
08:03:16.558 them inside of the meetings module. Make
08:03:19.280 sure you're inside of the modules
08:03:21.280 meetings types here. And in here change
08:03:24.878 this to be meeting get one. And in here
08:03:28.638 use meetings get one. So make sure that
08:03:32.000 you have implemented inside of our
08:03:34.000 meetings router get one protected
08:03:36.080 procedure which is something we did in
08:03:38.080 the meetings setup chapter alongside get
08:03:40.798 many. If you haven't it's a very short
08:03:43.360 procedure and you can implement it
08:03:46.120 now. Great. And now when you hover over
08:03:49.280 meeting get one, you will see the exact
08:03:52.160 meeting fields inside. Perfect. So let's
08:03:55.440 replace this with meeting get one from
08:03:58.718 dot dot/
08:04:00.200 do/types. And I seem to be having some
08:04:02.718 error here. Or maybe I just need to try
08:04:06.120 again. There we go. Now it's working.
08:04:09.360 And in here we are using the meetings
08:04:12.958 insert schema.
08:04:15.440 Now let's go ahead and actually append
08:04:17.760 that schema in our form here. So type of
08:04:21.040 off meetings insert schema. So the
08:04:23.280 resolver is using the meetings insert
08:04:25.718 schema. And we now also have to properly
08:04:29.040 add the form here. So the name will be
08:04:31.440 initial values name and the agent ID
08:04:33.920 will be initial values agent ID and also
08:04:37.920 use the meetings insert schema right
08:04:40.000 here.
08:04:41.520 Obviously, this will now cause errors
08:04:43.920 because we have not changed the
08:04:45.840 mutations here. So, let's start with
08:04:48.320 create agent. It's actually going to be
08:04:50.718 create meeting. Instead of TRPC agents
08:04:54.080 create, it's going to be TRPC
08:04:57.320 meetings.create like this. And for
08:05:00.478 invalidation, we are going to invalidate
08:05:03.120 meetings get many like this. And also to
08:05:06.718 do invalidate free usage. and on error
08:05:10.478 here toast the message and redirect to
08:05:13.760 upgrade. So exactly the same. Now let's
08:05:16.080 change this to update meeting use
08:05:19.440 meetings update and reinvalidate
08:05:22.478 meetings get many and reinvalidate
08:05:25.920 meetings get one when we update it like
08:05:29.398 this and all other to-dos stay exactly
08:05:32.878 the same. Perfect. So now what we have
08:05:35.840 to do is we have to modify the instances
08:05:37.840 of create agent to be create meeting and
08:05:41.680 update agent to be update meeting. And
08:05:44.638 that also includes right here update
08:05:47.600 agent and create uh update meeting and
08:05:51.200 create meeting. And there we go. No more
08:05:52.878 type errors because everything is
08:05:54.398 perfectly type safe. Now let's go down
08:05:57.440 here. And now we have to fix this form
08:06:00.080 field because inside of here it says to
08:06:02.718 use instructions but that's not true. We
08:06:04.878 will not be using instructions. So we
08:06:06.958 can remove this form field for now and
08:06:09.920 we can remove the text area import. So
08:06:12.398 now you have a completely uh valid form
08:06:16.160 which you can go ahead and add to the
08:06:19.040 dialogue. So, let's go back inside of
08:06:21.440 our new meeting dialogue here. And let's
08:06:25.040 go ahead and
08:06:26.760 import meeting form from forward slashme
08:06:31.280 form. And let's also add a router from
08:06:34.240 use router from next navigation
08:06:37.000 here like this. And inside of here,
08:06:40.398 let's add the meeting form.
08:06:44.240 And let's go ahead and add on success
08:06:46.440 here to accept an ID call on open change
08:06:50.958 to false and do a router
08:06:54.600 push to forward slash meetings and then
08:06:58.240 that meeting that we just created. So we
08:07:00.478 immediately open it up in case the user
08:07:02.478 immediately wants to start it and add on
08:07:05.200 open change here. Now we're going to
08:07:07.760 have to do a slight modification instead
08:07:10.320 of the meeting form here. So go inside
08:07:12.398 of meeting form and simply allow on
08:07:15.440 success to accept an optional ID of
08:07:18.600 string like
08:07:20.520 that. There we go. And then instead of
08:07:24.000 create meeting here on in the
08:07:26.920 onsuccess you can pass that. So for
08:07:29.360 example pass in the data and data do ID
08:07:33.440 and then the on success will now respond
08:07:36.478 with the ID and we can redirect to that
08:07:38.558 meeting ID. You could have also done
08:07:40.958 that here immediately. But since we have
08:07:43.120 a call back, let's use the call back. So
08:07:45.680 now when you refresh here, you will see
08:07:49.680 uh that you have a new meeting here with
08:07:52.320 the name here, but we also render the
08:07:54.320 avatar. So let's quickly fix that. Let's
08:07:56.240 go inside the new meeting
08:07:58.600 form. Let's find the generated avatar
08:08:01.200 and let's remove it entirely and let's
08:08:03.120 remove the import for it. So this is how
08:08:05.920 it's supposed to look like. Now let's go
08:08:08.398 ahead and let's give this a proper
08:08:11.478 placeholder. So this first input instead
08:08:13.920 of being a math tutor, let's for example
08:08:17.840 uh call this uh math
08:08:22.360 consultations like
08:08:25.558 this. Now we need to add one more field
08:08:28.398 to new meeting and that is the option to
08:08:30.478 select an agent. So the way I'm going to
08:08:33.360 do that is by implementing a new
08:08:35.440 component called command select. This
08:08:38.558 way it's going to be a type of select
08:08:40.320 which is responsive on mobile and a
08:08:42.798 model on desktop
08:08:45.000 devices. So let's go ahead and do the
08:08:47.120 following. Let's import react node and
08:08:49.360 use state from react. Let's import
08:08:52.558 chevrons updown
08:08:54.718 icon from lucid react.
08:08:57.920 Let's import CN from lib utilus and
08:09:00.000 button from components UI button. And
08:09:02.478 let's import the following from
08:09:04.160 components UI command command empty
08:09:06.638 input item list and responsive dialogue.
08:09:10.320 Now let's go ahead and create an
08:09:11.920 interface props here. First of all,
08:09:14.798 let's create an array of options. So we
08:09:17.440 are going to accept options which are
08:09:19.200 going to be an array of objects which
08:09:20.798 accept an ID, value, and children using
08:09:23.840 the React node import from above.
08:09:26.240 Besides the options, we're going to have
08:09:28.080 two functions. On select, which accepts
08:09:31.200 the value, and on search, which which is
08:09:34.000 an optional function, which accepts the
08:09:36.080 value. We are then going to have an
08:09:38.398 actual value, and three optional props
08:09:43.080 here. Placeholder is searchable, which
08:09:46.558 is a boolean, and class name, which is a
08:09:49.160 string. Then let's export con command
08:09:52.000 select here.
08:09:54.638 And inside of the props here, let's
08:09:56.398 assign them. And let's go ahead and
08:09:59.360 destructure all of them
08:10:02.600 here. Options on select, on search,
08:10:05.600 value, placeholder, and class name. And
08:10:07.840 let's give the placeholder a default
08:10:09.440 value of select an
08:10:12.200 option. Now in here, let's create a
08:10:14.878 state open and set open. Use state with
08:10:18.240 a default value of false. Then let's get
08:10:21.840 the selected option here to be
08:10:25.240 options.find get the option and compare
08:10:28.000 if option value is identical to the
08:10:30.798 current value that the user selected.
08:10:32.878 That's how we will find the selected
08:10:34.680 option inside of here. Go ahead and open
08:10:38.878 a fragment. Return a button. Inside of a
08:10:43.280 button, add a div, which is going to
08:10:46.080 check for selected option question mark
08:10:49.558 children or simply render a placeholder
08:10:52.478 if selected option was not
08:10:54.680 found. This div right here, I mean below
08:10:58.558 it, add chevrons updown
08:11:01.638 icon. For the button itself, give it a
08:11:04.398 type of button so it can safely be used
08:11:06.958 inside of a form.
08:11:09.120 variant of outline class name of CN
08:11:13.520 default classes will be height 9 justify
08:11:17.478 between font normal and px of two then
08:11:21.600 we're going to have class name whatever
08:11:23.600 the user passes and actually above that
08:11:27.440 let's add if there is no selected option
08:11:30.080 so make sure you put the question mark
08:11:31.520 before it in that case it's going to be
08:11:33.600 text muted
08:11:35.320 foreground like this so we are
08:11:38.000 transforming make a button to behave
08:11:39.680 like a
08:11:40.920 select. And then what we're going to do
08:11:43.600 outside of the button, we're going to
08:11:45.120 render the command responsive dialogue
08:11:48.040 component. Inside of here, let's add
08:11:50.558 open to be open. Let's add on open
08:11:53.040 change to be set open. Inside of here,
08:11:56.398 let's add a command input with a
08:12:00.600 placeholder of
08:12:04.120 search and on value change on
08:12:08.840 search. Below that, add a command
08:12:12.840 list. Add a command empty which will
08:12:16.718 render a span no options found. and give
08:12:20.958 the span a class name of text muted
08:12:23.440 foreground and text small below the
08:12:27.200 command empty. Let's iterate over all of
08:12:29.920 our options
08:12:31.718 here. Render the command item
08:12:36.680 here and inside render option dot
08:12:40.878 children. Give the command a key of
08:12:45.120 option do
08:12:47.478 ID and on
08:12:51.240 select call on select with option do
08:12:55.360 value and set open to
08:12:59.080 false. That's it. We will have to do one
08:13:02.638 more thing but first I want to
08:13:04.160 demonstrate how this currently looks
08:13:05.760 like so we have an easier time
08:13:09.000 understanding. So I want to go back to
08:13:11.840 the meeting form where we added the math
08:13:14.878 consultations input here. And let's go
08:13:17.520 ahead and do the following. Above all of
08:13:20.478 this, let's add our agents and let's
08:13:23.280 load them. So this time we are using use
08:13:26.240 query because we don't know where we are
08:13:28.718 going to use this model. So we cannot
08:13:30.718 guarantee with use suspense. So we're
08:13:33.600 just going to use the good old use query
08:13:35.360 here. Inside call tRPC agents get many
08:13:40.398 query
08:13:41.638 options. Set the page size here to be
08:13:44.680 100 and set the search here to
08:13:48.680 be const agent search. Set
08:13:52.520 agent search and use
08:13:56.200 state empty string and import use state
08:14:00.878 from
08:14:01.958 react like this.
08:14:05.440 Then also add const open set open use
08:14:10.240 state
08:14:12.760 false and in here add the agent
08:14:18.680 search. We are basically increasing the
08:14:21.360 page size to 100 and we are allowing the
08:14:24.638 user to search through the agents. So
08:14:26.478 this will this will be a better user
08:14:28.718 experience than a drop-own select
08:14:30.958 because this way they can actually
08:14:32.240 filter through all of the agents they
08:14:33.920 might have and they can also be more
08:14:36.958 specific with the search query ensuring
08:14:39.040 that we load them in this large data
08:14:42.200 set. Perfect. So now that we have this,
08:14:45.440 let's go ahead and let's import the
08:14:48.398 command select component which we've
08:14:50.718 just
08:14:51.878 created. And let's also
08:14:55.080 import generated avatar
08:14:59.718 component. And now let's go ahead and
08:15:02.638 let's copy our form field for the name
08:15:06.398 and let's paste it below here. Let's
08:15:08.718 change it to be agent ID and change the
08:15:11.920 form label to be agent. And inside of
08:15:14.478 the form control, you're going to do the
08:15:17.040 following. You will render the command
08:15:19.840 select option.
08:15:22.080 You will pass in the options here. Open
08:15:25.240 parenthesis agents data question mark
08:15:28.718 items or fall back to an empty array dot
08:15:32.958 map. Get the individual agent here and
08:15:36.240 immediately return an object.
08:15:40.080 Add an id to be agent ID, value to be
08:15:43.120 agent ID, and then children to be a
08:15:46.080 react node which will be a
08:15:50.280 div with a generated avatar inside a
08:15:54.320 class name of flex item as center and
08:15:57.440 gap x of two. Give the generated avatar
08:16:02.080 a seed of agent name variant of bots
08:16:06.878 neutral class name of border and size
08:16:11.558 six and below that a span rendering the
08:16:15.440 agent
08:16:16.440 name like this. And then let's add some
08:16:20.798 more options to command select which
08:16:23.920 will be on select to be field on
08:16:27.080 change on search will be set agent
08:16:30.878 search. So basically it's going to be
08:16:32.878 controlling this state here which will
08:16:34.798 then re-trigger this call every time it
08:16:38.120 changes and value field do value and the
08:16:42.638 placeholder will be select an
08:16:45.638 agent. So the only thing we have left
08:16:48.240 unused is the open and set open. We're
08:16:51.680 going to use that in a moment. But now
08:16:54.398 when you click on this uh it should open
08:16:58.240 the command. But looks like we did
08:17:00.000 something incorrect. So let's go back
08:17:01.600 instead of the command select here. Uh
08:17:04.000 and let's see what we did
08:17:07.080 incorrectly in the button. Let's add on
08:17:10.240 click here. Set open set to true. So
08:17:13.920 this is referring to the internal set
08:17:15.840 open of the command select not to this
08:17:18.798 is open. So now when you click here you
08:17:21.840 will see a list of your agents and you
08:17:23.840 will be able to select them. So if you
08:17:25.680 go inside of your agents here for
08:17:27.200 example and create a new
08:17:29.798 agent click
08:17:31.718 create. Go back to your meetings. Click
08:17:34.558 new meeting. You will find it here. And
08:17:36.798 if you search for new you will be able
08:17:39.680 Oh yeah. So right now it's not working
08:17:43.080 because we didn't uh properly implement
08:17:47.240 the filtering inside of the command. But
08:17:51.440 it's quite easy to do that. What we
08:17:53.680 actually have to do is we have to turn
08:17:56.000 off the way command component filters by
08:18:00.478 itself. So in order to do that we're
08:18:02.958 going to pass the prop should filter to
08:18:07.398 be the oppos to be the opposite of our
08:18:11.440 on search value. So if we have on search
08:18:14.478 in that case it's going to be false but
08:18:17.520 if we don't have it it's going to be
08:18:19.718 true but we are getting an error for it
08:18:22.478 which means we have to go inside of the
08:18:24.000 command responsive dialogue inside of
08:18:25.760 source components UI command find
08:18:28.240 function command responsive dialogue and
08:18:30.798 simply add a new prop here should filter
08:18:33.600 and set it by default to be
08:18:36.200 true. Go ahead and map it here. So
08:18:40.398 should filter is an optional boolean
08:18:43.760 like this and simply go ahead and in is
08:18:47.920 mobile add it to this command. So should
08:18:51.040 filter you can see the prop exists and
08:18:52.958 pass it here and make sure to also do it
08:18:55.360 in
08:18:58.360 here. There we go. So now our command
08:19:02.240 select will not use the internal
08:19:03.920 filtering. Instead it will use React
08:19:07.520 query search. So when I try this again
08:19:10.638 and write new, you can see how it loads
08:19:13.440 that new agent, right? So it's actually
08:19:16.160 doing an API call in the background here
08:19:18.478 or updated that. There we go. When I
08:19:21.360 click here, I can select the agent.
08:19:24.320 Amazing amazing job. So now when I click
08:19:27.760 test here and click create, we should be
08:19:30.240 able to create a new meeting. Uh and I
08:19:33.200 am redirected to that meeting ID page
08:19:35.600 immediately. So this is my URL right
08:19:38.160 now. There we go. Perfect. So if you
08:19:40.958 want to
08:19:42.638 uh you can enable inside of your
08:19:46.160 meetings
08:19:47.878 view
08:19:50.120 the data JSON JSON stringify
08:19:54.520 data. Let's just give it a class name
08:19:56.878 overflow X scroll. So it doesn't move
08:20:00.798 our content too much. Well, it still
08:20:02.958 moves it, but you can see uh our items
08:20:06.320 total says two. If I go ahead and create
08:20:09.520 a new
08:20:10.440 one right here, go back to the meetings.
08:20:13.760 Now, it says total three. So, we are
08:20:15.600 successfully creating new ones, right?
08:20:17.680 Just make sure to scroll here in case
08:20:19.840 your button is disappearing. And you can
08:20:21.920 now, you know, comment it out so you can
08:20:23.840 see it here. Normally, one more thing we
08:20:26.240 have to add here is a text. uh if the
08:20:29.520 user never created an agent so they have
08:20:32.080 a quick way to create it and we already
08:20:34.638 have the dialogue for
08:20:36.920 that. So inside of the new meeting form
08:20:41.200 let's change this to be a bit more
08:20:43.120 precise. So open agent dialogue.
08:20:46.840 Open new agent dialogue and set open new
08:20:51.840 agent dialogue. So we are specific about
08:20:54.558 what this is. And then we're going to go
08:20:57.200 ahead and find our agent ID form field.
08:21:00.240 And after form control, let's add form
08:21:04.080 description here. And make sure to
08:21:06.160 import this from components
08:21:09.080 UI4. Inside of here, we're going to ask
08:21:12.240 not found what
08:21:15.160 appos your My
08:21:18.120 apologies. Not found
08:21:21.638 what like this you are looking for. You
08:21:26.398 can add a space like this. Go to new
08:21:28.240 line and render a normal button here.
08:21:32.080 Create new
08:21:33.478 agent. Give this normal button a type of
08:21:36.398 button. This is very important. a class
08:21:38.878 name of text primary hover
08:21:42.680 underline and on click we'll very simply
08:21:46.558 call set open new agent dialogue to
08:21:51.120 true. Currently this doesn't control
08:21:54.638 anything. So what we have to do now is
08:21:57.360 we have to actually use it. So let's go
08:22:01.478 ahead inside of here.
08:22:04.638 Let's go wrap our entire
08:22:07.478 form in a
08:22:10.040 fragment like
08:22:11.878 this. Oops. In a
08:22:15.478 fragment. And then
08:22:17.798 here simply render the new agent
08:22:20.680 dialogue and pass it open to be open on
08:22:25.040 open change to be
08:22:27.638 set open new agent dialogue and this
08:22:30.080 will be open new agent dialogue. Make
08:22:32.798 sure you import new agent dialogue
08:22:34.558 component from modules agents UI
08:22:36.958 components new agent dialogue. So now in
08:22:39.600 here you have a quick button to create a
08:22:41.440 new agent here. And for example, right
08:22:44.320 now it doesn't exist here. So if I go
08:22:46.000 ahead and create new
08:22:47.638 one, click create, it automatically
08:22:50.478 invalidates the get many query. So it
08:22:52.638 immediately appears here and we can
08:22:55.520 create it. Amazing. Amazing job. So, I
08:22:58.878 think I've noticed one little bug here,
08:23:00.558 which we're going to do in the next
08:23:01.680 chapter, and that's if I search for
08:23:03.440 something and close it and open it up
08:23:05.120 again. Uh, you can see it stays in that
08:23:07.760 weird state. So, I'm going to look into
08:23:10.478 that and fix it in the next chapter, but
08:23:12.718 you just wrapped up the new meeting
08:23:15.120 form. So, we can now create new
08:23:17.280 meetings. What we're going to do in the
08:23:19.120 next chapter is actually display them
08:23:21.120 and filter them. Now let's go ahead and
08:23:26.280 let's create, review, and merge the pull
08:23:30.040 request. So this chapter is called 17
08:23:33.120 meetings form. So I'm going to create a
08:23:34.878 new branch
08:23:36.280 here. 17 meetings form. Once you're in
08:23:41.040 the new branch, go inside of your source
08:23:43.240 control. Mark all of these changes as
08:23:46.398 staged changes and add a commit message.
08:23:50.398 17
08:23:51.798 meetings form. Let's click commit and
08:23:55.440 let's publish the branch. Once the
08:23:57.920 branch has been
08:23:59.478 published, let's go ahead and open a
08:24:01.600 pull request here and let's see what
08:24:04.320 code rabbit has to say about our
08:24:08.360 code. And here we have the summary. So,
08:24:12.080 we introduced a couple of new features
08:24:14.000 including a customizable drop-down
08:24:16.080 select component with search
08:24:17.680 capabilities. So that's our new command
08:24:19.760 select component. We added a header
08:24:22.000 section with a new meeting button and a
08:24:23.920 dialogue for creating messages. My
08:24:26.080 apologies meetings. We implemented a
08:24:28.558 form for creating and editing meetings
08:24:30.638 with validation and agent selection
08:24:32.798 using the command select component and
08:24:35.280 of course a model dialogue for creating
08:24:37.600 a new meetings with navigate on success
08:24:40.680 here. So let's go ahead and go through
08:24:43.280 this sequence diagram. We're not going
08:24:44.958 to go through entire sequence diagram.
08:24:47.600 We're just going to go through this.
08:24:50.320 What happens when we click on a new
08:24:52.240 meeting? So the user clicks on a new
08:24:54.000 meeting in the meeting meetings list
08:24:55.920 header component. After that we open the
08:24:58.000 dialogue which renders the form meeting
08:25:00.320 form and once we submit that form we
08:25:03.360 create it through our server procedures
08:25:06.000 here and we validate the data. The
08:25:09.120 server procedures return the created
08:25:11.120 meeting and then we fire the on success
08:25:14.398 where we close the dialogue and we
08:25:16.798 redirect the user to the new page which
08:25:18.798 is the meeting ID page.
08:25:21.558 Perfect. And down here we have some
08:25:24.520 actionable comments here to complete
08:25:27.360 these to-dos which is completely valid
08:25:29.760 but since this is a tutorial I'm not
08:25:31.440 going to do them right away. I will do
08:25:32.878 it when it makes sense so you see why we
08:25:35.680 are doing it. So I will close this. Uh
08:25:38.798 in here it suggests adding the is
08:25:41.840 loading for our command select. That's
08:25:44.160 something we can consider later. And in
08:25:46.958 here it found a bug which we have to
08:25:49.040 fix. So right now our new meeting
08:25:51.240 dialogue does not cancel properly. So I
08:25:54.958 think you can actually try that. If you
08:25:56.398 click new meeting and click cancel,
08:25:58.798 nothing happens. So that is because
08:26:01.040 inside our new meeting dialogue here we
08:26:04.798 didn't call on open change properly. We
08:26:08.000 need to pass false to it like
08:26:12.200 this. So what I'm going to do now is I'm
08:26:15.200 going to do that in the second chapter
08:26:17.840 simply because in case you already
08:26:20.718 merged it right so I don't want to cause
08:26:22.638 you any problems. We're just going to do
08:26:24.240 it in the next chapter in the new
08:26:25.760 branch. But this is a bug found by code
08:26:28.878 rabbit. I have completely missed this.
08:26:31.520 Great job. So, let's go ahead and merge
08:26:34.000 this pull request as it is right
08:26:36.280 now. And once it's merged, let's go
08:26:39.280 ahead back inside of our main branch
08:26:41.680 here. And let's click synchronize
08:26:44.040 changes. Let's click
08:26:46.920 okay. And then everything should be
08:26:50.318 fixed. Let's click on the source and go
08:26:52.798 inside of the graph. And we just merged
08:26:54.798 17 meetings form. Amazing. Amazing job.
08:26:58.398 That marks the end of this chapter and
08:27:00.558 see you in the next
08:27:02.680 one. In this chapter, we are going to
08:27:05.200 implement the meetings data table. This
08:27:07.520 will include modifying the procedures to
08:27:09.680 include the duration column and inner
08:27:12.318 join on the relevant agent for that
08:27:14.638 meeting. We are also going to make the
08:27:16.798 existing data table component reusable
08:27:19.040 and we're going to add the empty state
08:27:20.798 component for the meetings view. Let's
08:27:23.840 start with modifying our procedures for
08:27:26.240 my meetings page. So let's go inside of
08:27:29.280 source modules meetings server
08:27:33.160 procedures. Before you start writing
08:27:35.360 anything, make sure that you're on your
08:27:37.200 default branch. Go ahead and find the
08:27:40.558 get many protected procedure. And we are
08:27:43.520 now going to modify the await database
08:27:46.000 here, specifically the select. After we
08:27:49.040 spread all the columns from the meetings
08:27:50.798 schema, let's also include an individual
08:27:53.120 agent relevant for this meeting, which
08:27:55.200 will use the agents schema. You have to
08:27:57.920 import that from database schema. Then
08:28:00.798 while you're in the imports also import
08:28:02.958 SQL from Drizzle
08:28:05.478 ORM. Now go ahead and add a duration
08:28:08.878 here. The duration will be calculated by
08:28:11.920 using the meetings schema started at and
08:28:15.920 ended at
08:28:17.318 timestamps. And we're going to use pure
08:28:19.680 SQL. So open SQL like this. You can give
08:28:23.760 it a type of number.
08:28:26.478 And in here write
08:28:29.398 extract epoch from open parenthesis. And
08:28:34.080 then make sure you don't misspell your
08:28:36.160 columns. So you can copy them from here.
08:28:39.120 Ended at
08:28:41.878 minus started at like this. And then
08:28:46.398 simply add
08:28:48.200 dot
08:28:49.958 as duration like this.
08:28:55.120 After that, let's go ahead and after we
08:28:57.760 select from meetings, let's add an inner
08:29:00.558 join here for the agents. And we are
08:29:03.760 specifically going to join all agents
08:29:06.878 that have the meeting ID. My apologies,
08:29:10.718 all agents that were used in our
08:29:12.638 meetings. So, meetings. ID. Agents do
08:29:16.080 ID, that's what we are matching. So for
08:29:18.240 each meeting that will be iterated here
08:29:19.760 in the select, we're going to find its
08:29:21.920 relevant meeting ID and we are going to
08:29:24.160 search for an existing agent ID and we
08:29:27.200 are only going to render the meetings
08:29:29.120 which were successfully matched with
08:29:32.080 their agent. That's why we're using an
08:29:33.920 inner join. If we were to use a left
08:29:36.240 join, then we would be okay with an
08:29:38.318 agent being null. But that's not the
08:29:40.718 case for us because the agent is always
08:29:42.798 required. So inner join is the correct
08:29:44.958 usage for this. Great. And now I think
08:29:48.798 we should also add this to our total
08:29:52.398 simply so it ex it is 100% accurate
08:29:56.478 about uh the amount of data that we are
08:29:59.920 working with here. Great. So now we have
08:30:03.200 successfully modified our procedures and
08:30:06.000 we can go ahead and render that inside
08:30:08.240 of a data table.
08:30:11.120 So let's go ahead and let's copy the
08:30:13.760 data table
08:30:15.080 component from modules agents UI
08:30:18.398 components and let's copy the data table
08:30:20.958 and let's actually add it to our global
08:30:23.840 components right here because it is
08:30:26.398 different enough uh it is generic enough
08:30:28.878 that it can be used multiple times. So
08:30:31.520 now that we have pasted it inside of
08:30:33.200 here, we can go inside of source modules
08:30:37.000 meetings
08:30:39.558 UI views meetings view and we can now
08:30:43.600 use it here data table from components
08:30:47.680 data
08:30:49.240 table. The only thing that's missing
08:30:51.520 here is the actual well columns, right?
08:30:56.160 So let's just pass in the items here.
08:30:58.000 And now we have to develop the columns.
08:31:01.440 So let's go ahead and let's copy the
08:31:03.680 existing columns from agents here. So in
08:31:06.080 UI components we have the columns here
08:31:09.120 and let's paste them inside of our
08:31:11.520 meetings UI components. So now we have
08:31:14.000 columns here as well. So what I want to
08:31:16.638 do now is I want to go inside of my
08:31:18.718 meetings types and I will copy meeting
08:31:21.200 get one and I will replace it with
08:31:22.878 getting meeting get many and let's use
08:31:25.520 meetings get many here as well.
08:31:28.478 So now inside of my columns I will be a
08:31:30.878 bit more specific. So make sure you are
08:31:33.120 inside of your newly copied columns in
08:31:34.878 the meetings and import meeting get many
08:31:38.398 and then in here specify number. So uh
08:31:43.360 actually let's go ahead and do type
08:31:45.958 meeting get many number like
08:31:49.558 this or maybe I'm doing something wrong
08:31:52.160 here. Oh yes. So get many here should be
08:31:55.000 items. My apologies. And yes, then you
08:31:58.718 can use the number here. And then uh
08:32:00.878 this number will just be a single one of
08:32:04.000 these values here. The reason I'm using
08:32:06.240 meeting get many and not meeting get one
08:32:08.798 is because these columns will be loaded
08:32:11.120 using the get many procedures. Right?
08:32:15.680 And instead of this get many procedures,
08:32:17.520 we just modified the select. The select
08:32:20.638 here is different than the one from get
08:32:23.040 one. The get one doesn't have it. So it
08:32:25.360 would be an incorrect column data. So
08:32:27.520 that's why I will I'm instead using
08:32:30.318 meeting get many and simply specifying a
08:32:34.000 single item from there by using the
08:32:36.000 number operator here. Great. So now that
08:32:38.798 we have this, let's go ahead and let's
08:32:40.398 add everything that we will need from
08:32:41.920 here. Let's start by adding npm install
08:32:44.958 date
08:32:46.520 FNS like
08:32:48.440 this. Once you have added date FNS, just
08:32:51.920 go ahead and include it here. Let's also
08:32:55.280 add mpm install humanize
08:32:59.160 duration with legacy period apps as
08:33:02.760 well. Let's import that here. There we
08:33:06.718 go. Then we're going to need a lot of
08:33:08.798 icons from Lucid React besides these
08:33:12.120 here. So let's go ahead and add the
08:33:16.080 following icons.
08:33:19.280 circle check icon, circle X icon, circle
08:33:22.080 arrow up
08:33:23.318 icon, C clock fading icon, and corner
08:33:26.638 down right icon and lastly loader icon
08:33:29.520 like
08:33:30.280 this. We are going to need the CN libut
08:33:34.958 from here and uh that's going to be it.
08:33:37.840 So now let's go ahead and before we
08:33:39.840 start the columns let's implement a
08:33:41.798 function format duration here seconds
08:33:46.080 number and return humanize duration here
08:33:49.760 multiply the seconds by a
08:33:52.360 th00and largest will be one round will
08:33:56.160 be true and units here will be
08:33:59.398 hours and seconds you're going to see
08:34:02.638 how we're going to use this function in
08:34:04.160 a
08:34:04.840 second. Great. Now let's go ahead and
08:34:07.360 let's define a const status icon map. So
08:34:11.680 depending on what status the meeting is
08:34:13.760 in, we're going to display a different
08:34:15.520 icon. If it's in upcoming, it will be
08:34:17.760 clock arrow app icon. Active this one.
08:34:20.240 Completed this one. Processing this one.
08:34:22.558 And canled this one. It is very
08:34:24.798 important that you don't misspel these
08:34:26.478 ones. And if you aren't sure, you can go
08:34:29.040 inside of your schema here and find the
08:34:31.360 meeting status. So you can copy them
08:34:33.280 from here. Make sure you don't misspell
08:34:35.280 them.
08:34:36.638 And now what you're going to do is
08:34:38.558 create another map called status color
08:34:41.040 map. So depending on
08:34:44.200 upcoming,
08:34:45.878 active,
08:34:47.558 completed, processing or
08:34:52.280 cancelled, you will have specific
08:34:54.318 colors.
08:34:56.478 An easy way to tell you've done it
08:34:58.638 correctly without typos is to click on
08:35:01.440 one of them and the other one will
08:35:02.878 highlight, meaning that it's exactly the
08:35:05.120 same. There we go. So, let's go ahead
08:35:07.920 and do the upcoming one first. So, it's
08:35:09.920 going to have a BG yellow with 20%
08:35:12.600 opacity. It's going to have a text of
08:35:15.520 yellow. Whoops. A text yellow 800. And
08:35:20.080 it's going to have border yellow 800
08:35:24.080 with 5% opacity. And the other ones will
08:35:27.478 be very similar, just different colors.
08:35:30.718 So the active will be background blue
08:35:33.120 with 520% opacity, text blue 800 and
08:35:36.718 border blue 800 /
08:35:39.798 5. For the completed one, same thing but
08:35:43.040 using the emerald.
08:35:45.600 For the cancelled
08:35:48.120 one, my apologies, for the processing,
08:35:50.718 it's going to be
08:35:51.878 rows and the exact same values as the
08:35:54.638 ones above. The only one that will be
08:35:57.040 slightly different is the processing
08:35:59.718 one. My apologies. So, I have um
08:36:03.200 reversed these two. So, instead of
08:36:06.000 processing here, this will be cancel
08:36:08.958 like this. Cancelled one will be using
08:36:11.360 the rose color. And then change the last
08:36:13.280 one to be processing.
08:36:15.360 like that. This one we'll use gray 300
08:36:19.040 with 20% opacity and the rest will be
08:36:21.520 the same. So you can pause and
08:36:23.718 copy. And now we are ready to build our
08:36:26.318 columns. Let's start with the accessor
08:36:28.878 key name which will now be meeting name.
08:36:32.398 The flex flex call gap y1 will be the
08:36:35.120 same. And then inside of here let's
08:36:37.600 immediately add a span here which will
08:36:40.600 render the row.name.
08:36:44.120 name with a class name font semibold and
08:36:48.360 capitalize like
08:36:51.000 this. Now go ahead and remove this div
08:36:54.080 here. So we can immediately work on this
08:36:56.478 one flex item center and gap x2
08:36:59.040 rendering the corner down right
08:37:01.798 icon. Instead of this flex item center
08:37:04.878 gap x2, add a new div with a class name
08:37:08.760 flex items center gap x1 like this. And
08:37:13.280 simply encapsulate the corner down right
08:37:15.520 icon and the span. And this will render
08:37:17.600 the agent name. And then outside of this
08:37:21.840 div, add a generated avatar component.
08:37:25.120 This will use a variant of bots
08:37:28.440 neutral seed row original
08:37:33.558 agent.name and a class name of size
08:37:38.080 four. And after that add a span element
08:37:41.360 here
08:37:43.318 row.st started at if we have it we're
08:37:46.318 going to format that exact field. So
08:37:49.840 started at using
08:37:51.638 mm and d format. otherwise an empty
08:37:56.160 string and give this a class name of
08:37:58.318 text small and text muted
08:38:02.360 foreground. Now let's go to the second
08:38:04.760 cell which will be the status and a
08:38:07.760 header will be status and inside of here
08:38:11.440 let's go ahead and do the following.
08:38:12.718 Let's remove the cell function like this
08:38:14.478 and let's open the curly brackets. And
08:38:16.558 first let's grab our icon which will be
08:38:19.280 status icon
08:38:21.000 map row original dot status as key of
08:38:25.840 type of status icon
08:38:28.600 map and then let's go ahead and let's
08:38:31.520 return a badge element here and inside
08:38:34.718 we are going to render that icon. Let's
08:38:37.440 go ahead and append some props here. So
08:38:40.798 variant will be outline. Last name here
08:38:43.840 will be CN
08:38:48.520 capitalize. Go ahead and target an SVG
08:38:51.318 here. Give it a size of four and text
08:38:55.200 muted foreground. And then let's go
08:38:58.798 ahead and check if status color map has
08:39:03.280 an
08:39:04.200 original status here which should be a
08:39:07.200 key
08:39:08.280 of type of status color map. So now our
08:39:13.600 icon will automatically be generated
08:39:15.360 depending on the meeting status as well
08:39:17.600 as our color here for that badge. And
08:39:20.878 for the icon here we can give it a class
08:39:23.440 name CN
08:39:25.760 row original status is processing. And
08:39:30.240 in that case simply do animate spin. So
08:39:32.558 it shows a spinning uh icon. And let's
08:39:36.160 render the row
08:39:37.718 original status here like that. And now
08:39:42.000 let's go ahead and do the last column
08:39:45.240 here with accessor key duration.
08:39:50.638 And let's do header of
08:39:54.760 duration. And I think I have to do
08:39:57.558 this here. My apologies. So I add a
08:40:00.558 comma here because this curly bracket is
08:40:03.600 the cell function. So make sure you're
08:40:06.318 doing it in the proper uh indent like I
08:40:10.000 have now. And let's open a cell. Let's
08:40:12.398 dstructure the row here. And let's
08:40:14.638 return another badge
08:40:16.520 here like this.
08:40:19.600 Now let's go ahead and give this badge
08:40:22.558 the following variant of outline and
08:40:27.600 let's copy the class
08:40:29.398 name. You can copy it uh from here like
08:40:34.680 this. So class name capitalize and SVG
08:40:39.840 size 4 flex items center and gap X of
08:40:43.600 two. And inside of here, add the clock
08:40:47.920 fading icon. Give it a class name of
08:40:51.680 size, my apologies, text blue
08:40:55.798 700. And check if we have row original
08:40:59.440 duration. And in that case, format
08:41:01.958 duration using the row original duration
08:41:05.520 as the prop. Otherwise, simply render no
08:41:07.680 duration, meaning this meeting has not
08:41:09.440 been started yet.
08:41:13.200 Now let's go and see what we have not
08:41:16.080 being used. So we didn't use humanized
08:41:18.080 duration. Uh not true. My apologies. Uh
08:41:20.878 we did not install the
08:41:24.200 types for humaniz
08:41:28.840 duration. There we go. So this is how
08:41:32.240 the full command looks
08:41:34.120 like. And let me just quickly show you
08:41:36.798 my package JSON. So, humanize duration
08:41:40.398 and date FNS. There we go. Perfect. So,
08:41:44.558 now we can go back inside of the
08:41:46.000 meetings view and we can pass the
08:41:48.478 columns here to be columns from that
08:41:52.240 forward/c columns. And now when you try
08:41:55.680 to load the meetings, it should have a
08:41:58.240 complete new
08:42:00.600 look. What we have to do now is add some
08:42:03.440 padding. And it seems like something's
08:42:05.600 wrong with the colors here. So let's
08:42:07.440 just quickly go inside of here and let's
08:42:09.840 see what's going on. So status color map
08:42:12.478 upcoming. We definitely have that. And
08:42:14.318 this is a status of upcoming status
08:42:16.958 color map
08:42:19.878 here. Let's just see. Is there something
08:42:22.558 we're doing incorrectly
08:42:25.718 here? I think everything's okay with our
08:42:28.398 code because the icon is rendered
08:42:30.798 correctly, right? This is the correct
08:42:32.398 icon we assigned. So this line of code
08:42:34.958 should work just fine. Um, so I'm going
08:42:38.040 to debug this in the next chapter. It
08:42:41.040 could be because of the just in time
08:42:42.718 compiler for Tailwind. Maybe I'm going
08:42:45.600 to explore a bit. But anyway, let's go
08:42:47.840 ahead and focus on wrapping this chapter
08:42:49.520 up by going back inside of the meetings
08:42:51.200 view here and give this div a proper
08:42:54.558 class name of flex one, padding bottom
08:42:56.958 of four, px of four, medium px of 8,
08:43:01.120 flex flex column, and gap y of four.
08:43:04.958 There we go. Perfect. Uh, so in the next
08:43:07.920 chapter, we're going to add the filters.
08:43:09.680 And you can go ahead and try something
08:43:11.200 here and click create. And there we go.
08:43:14.478 You can see our agent right here.
08:43:16.718 Perfect. So now it looks very similar to
08:43:19.040 our agents uh field. Let's just wait a
08:43:22.080 second for this to load. Uh, and the
08:43:24.878 style is matching, the theme is
08:43:26.798 matching, and our data table looks the
08:43:29.920 same.
08:43:31.920 I just want to change one thing and that
08:43:34.958 is to make data table component reusable
08:43:37.840 here and also we have to add the empty
08:43:39.680 state component. Yes, I forgot about
08:43:41.120 that. So let's go ahead and do the
08:43:43.440 following inside of source modules
08:43:46.520 agents inside of UI views agents view.
08:43:51.520 Let's go ahead and let's
08:43:54.160 uh import the data table not from
08:43:57.520 components data table local ones but
08:44:00.558 instead from the global ones right using
08:44:03.040 at components data table so it's
08:44:05.160 reusable which means that we can now go
08:44:07.360 inside of the modules agents UI
08:44:09.200 components and we can delete the data
08:44:11.280 table from here we no longer need it and
08:44:13.920 one more thing I want to fix here is my
08:44:17.040 columns inside of the agents so let's go
08:44:19.120 inside of the in the types first and
08:44:22.638 let's go ahead and prepare
08:44:24.920 agent get many agents get many agents
08:44:30.160 get many items like this. Then go inside
08:44:35.120 of UI components columns and in here
08:44:39.120 when you use agents get one use agents
08:44:43.280 get many
08:44:45.398 number and nothing should change. The
08:44:47.760 agents view should work perfectly fine.
08:44:50.160 But we are now using the proper get many
08:44:54.840 inference. And now we also have to add
08:44:57.760 the empty state. So we can copy this
08:45:00.000 from the agents view right here. And
08:45:02.638 let's go inside of
08:45:04.840 meetings UI views meetings view. And
08:45:08.478 let's just add that right
08:45:10.440 here. Import empty state from components
08:45:13.360 empty state. And now we just have to
08:45:14.958 change this to create your
08:45:16.920 first meeting like this. And let's add a
08:45:21.080 description. So the description I will
08:45:23.440 use is the following. Schedule a meeting
08:45:25.680 to connect with others. Each meeting
08:45:27.360 lets you collaborate, share ideas, and
08:45:29.280 interact with participants in real time.
08:45:32.240 Perfect. So, if you want to see that in
08:45:34.398 action, go inside of your meetings here
08:45:38.000 and go inside of your Neon Console or
08:45:41.120 Drizzle Studio and simply delete all
08:45:44.120 meetings and then do a refresh here and
08:45:47.760 you should see this create your first
08:45:50.280 meeting. Amazing. That's it. Let's go
08:45:52.958 ahead and merge this pull request. So,
08:45:54.958 meetings data
08:45:57.080 table. I'm going to create a new branch.
08:46:01.360 18 meetings data
08:46:04.360 table. I'm going to stage all changes.
08:46:07.520 There we go. I will write a commit
08:46:10.440 message and I will click commit and
08:46:13.360 publish
08:46:14.600 branch. And once the branch has been
08:46:17.120 published, let's go ahead and review the
08:46:20.160 pull
08:46:23.240 request. And here we have this chapter's
08:46:26.160 summary. We introduced a new table view
08:46:28.398 for meetings, displaying meeting name,
08:46:30.478 status, agent details, and human
08:46:32.718 readable duration. We added empty state
08:46:35.360 messaging to guide users when no
08:46:37.040 meetings are present. We enhanced
08:46:39.200 meeting data by including related agent
08:46:41.440 information and computed duration for
08:46:43.520 each meeting. We improved the agents
08:46:45.600 table typing for more accurate data
08:46:48.360 representation. Perfect. So in here, I
08:46:52.160 don't think there's anything too useful
08:46:53.440 in the sequence diagram that we haven't
08:46:55.440 seen before. But as you can see, it
08:46:57.760 immediately added to the diagram that we
08:46:59.680 now join the agents and compute the
08:47:02.160 duration. Right? So it's not just
08:47:03.520 repeating the same diagrams. It's
08:47:05.040 actively reading the context of
08:47:06.558 everything we've done before. And you
08:47:08.318 can see how it detected all related PRs
08:47:11.520 because we previously added these kinds
08:47:14.000 of things. So it knows that this is
08:47:15.920 similar. So it tells you this is
08:47:18.080 possibly related. We might want to take
08:47:19.520 a look at that. Right in a real world
08:47:20.958 example, this will be extremely useful.
08:47:23.440 And we have one comment here to improve
08:47:25.440 the duration SQL. Uh I'm not a SQL
08:47:28.160 expert, so I'm don't know what to tell
08:47:30.160 you if this is good or not. If you want
08:47:32.080 to, you can try it out, but I will stick
08:47:33.680 with what I know worked for my project
08:47:35.840 right here. Great. So, let's go ahead
08:47:39.040 and resolve this conversation and let's
08:47:41.840 merge this pull request. And after we've
08:47:45.680 emerged the pull request, let's go back
08:47:47.440 to our main branch here. And let's click
08:47:49.920 on the synchronize changes button and
08:47:52.398 click okay. And inside of your source
08:47:55.120 control here in the graph, you will see
08:47:58.160 18 being merged. Amazing amazing job.
08:48:01.760 That marks the end of this chapter. And
08:48:03.600 see you in the next
08:48:05.558 one. In this chapter, we're going to
08:48:08.160 implement the meetings filters the same
08:48:10.240 way we implemented the agent filters.
08:48:12.958 But before we do that, we're going to
08:48:14.878 improve the badge padding and we're
08:48:16.878 going to fix command select component
08:48:19.280 filter reset. I'm going to showcase both
08:48:22.000 of these issues in a second. We are then
08:48:24.558 going to modify the meetings get many
08:48:26.478 procedure, add the Nooks filters and
08:48:28.638 create UI for those filters. So,
08:48:31.600 regarding our previous issue uh where I
08:48:36.000 had problems with displaying the status
08:48:38.558 color, you can see that I no longer have
08:48:41.040 that issue. Looks like all I had to do
08:48:42.798 was wait for Tailwind's just in time
08:48:44.718 compiler to analyze the classes. If you
08:48:47.280 are still having that problem, you can
08:48:49.600 try doing
08:48:51.160 rmrf next and then simply doing npm
08:48:54.160 rundev
08:48:55.878 again. This should clear up the cache
08:48:58.558 and perhaps restart the just in time
08:49:01.040 compiler from
08:49:03.000 Tailwind. Now let's go ahead inside of
08:49:06.638 source components UI badge. And before
08:49:10.718 you write anything, just a reminder,
08:49:12.478 make sure you are on your default main
08:49:14.240 branch here. And change the py to one
08:49:17.520 instead of 0.5. So I just want to make
08:49:19.680 my badges a little bit taller. Great.
08:49:22.958 Now the second problem we have is when
08:49:25.600 selecting something from here and
08:49:27.200 typing, for example, new and closing it
08:49:30.318 and opening it again, it only displays
08:49:32.878 those two. So what we have to do is go
08:49:35.200 inside of um source components command
08:49:39.798 select and go ahead
08:49:42.798 uh and implement const on close or let's
08:49:48.558 call it handle
08:49:52.280 close like
08:49:54.600 this and actually let's call it handle
08:49:57.680 open change value is a boolean like this
08:50:02.398 and then what you're going to do is call
08:50:04.080 the on search but only if it exists like
08:50:07.840 this. And in here simply pass an empty
08:50:10.558 string to reset the query and then set
08:50:13.200 open set to
08:50:15.000 value and then use the handle open
08:50:17.958 change for command responsive dialogue
08:50:20.878 on open change. So on open change as you
08:50:24.160 can see will give you the open boolean
08:50:27.120 here. So to make it clearer you could
08:50:28.878 call this open like that.
08:50:32.718 So when you try it now, click on new
08:50:35.160 meeting. This still works as usual. And
08:50:37.840 if you search for new and it loads these
08:50:40.478 two and then you close it and open
08:50:42.878 again, it reset the query back to an
08:50:45.760 empty search. Great. So that's two
08:50:48.638 problems that we had resolved. Now let's
08:50:51.520 modify the meetings get many
08:50:55.080 procedure. So let's go inside of the
08:50:57.840 meetings server procedures.
08:50:59.600 Specifically, let's go inside of the get
08:51:01.280 many procedure
08:51:03.080 here alongside search. Let's add agent
08:51:06.878 ID Z string and nullish as well. And
08:51:12.000 then let's go ahead inside of the
08:51:13.520 meeting types here. And let's go ahead
08:51:16.798 and create export
08:51:19.558 type, my apologies, export enum meeting
08:51:25.878 status. And in here, go ahead and add
08:51:29.040 the following statuses. Upcoming,
08:51:31.760 active, completed, processing, and
08:51:33.958 cancelled. Always do this by looking at
08:51:36.920 your database schema file. And just
08:51:40.478 don't misspell them. You can copy and
08:51:42.398 paste them and add them here. So this
08:51:45.360 value is what matters. This can be named
08:51:48.000 whatever, but this inside of the strings
08:51:51.440 needs to match this exactly using
08:51:54.718 including the casing as well.
08:51:56.958 So now that you have that, let's go
08:51:59.040 ahead inside of the procedures here and
08:52:02.080 let's add status and let's make that
08:52:04.240 Z.NU Enum and inside of here you're
08:52:08.000 going to import meeting status from dot
08:52:12.318 dot slashtypes like this and very simply
08:52:15.760 add dot upcoming as one of the options
08:52:19.120 and then simply continue adding active
08:52:21.520 completed processing and cancelled all
08:52:23.920 of them and chain nullish to the status
08:52:28.240 enum as
08:52:29.718 well. Now let's go inside of the query
08:52:32.478 here and after page size extract the
08:52:35.558 status search and the agent ID. You can
08:52:39.840 remove the search as we already have it
08:52:41.878 here. So just status and the agent ID
08:52:46.478 and then inside of the where let's go
08:52:48.318 ahead and add some new things. So after
08:52:50.240 search check if you have a status that
08:52:52.878 user requested and then use equals
08:52:56.080 meetings status with the status
08:52:59.120 otherwise
08:53:00.600 undefined. Confirm that you have equals
08:53:03.120 imported from Drizzle
08:53:05.798 OM. Perfect. And now that you've added
08:53:08.318 that also add agent ID in the same way
08:53:12.798 using the equals and agent ID value.
08:53:15.680 Make sure you're using the proper values
08:53:17.600 here like that. otherwise undefined.
08:53:20.558 Perfect. And then I want to copy these
08:53:24.240 two and add them to the total query as
08:53:27.600 well. So I get the proper total amount
08:53:31.240 here. Great. And that's it. That's all
08:53:33.600 we need for our get many procedure. So
08:53:36.878 we have added that. Now let's add our
08:53:38.958 Nooks
08:53:40.760 filters. Let's go inside of our meetings
08:53:45.040 and let's also open the agents. And I
08:53:46.878 think that we can borrow the hooks here.
08:53:48.638 So copy the hooks folder and paste it
08:53:51.040 inside of the meetings here. So you will
08:53:53.440 now you have use agents filters. Go
08:53:56.000 ahead and rename it to use meetings
08:53:58.798 filters. Make sure you're doing that
08:54:00.318 inside of the meetings module. Go ahead
08:54:02.718 and return use meetings filters here. So
08:54:06.478 the search and the page are exactly the
08:54:08.958 same. So now let's go ahead and
08:54:11.958 add parse as string enum here. And let's
08:54:19.240 import meeting status from dot dot
08:54:22.680 /types. So now you can go ahead and add
08:54:26.680 status to be parse as string enum and
08:54:31.440 open object do values meeting status. So
08:54:34.718 these are the possible options for the
08:54:36.958 status in the URL. And
08:54:39.958 lastly add agent ID which is just a
08:54:43.600 normal string with clear on default
08:54:45.680 here. And no need for any clear on
08:54:47.840 default for the status. So leave that as
08:54:51.558 is. Now let's go ahead and let's go
08:54:54.240 inside of the agents and let's copy the
08:54:56.318 params and let's paste them in the
08:54:58.760 meetings. And now we are just going to
08:55:01.200 modify the new meetings params with
08:55:05.040 uh the new things we added in the use
08:55:07.120 meetings filters. So import parse string
08:55:09.680 as enum from Nook server. Make sure
08:55:12.160 you're working in the params we just
08:55:13.840 copied and put in the meetings module.
08:55:16.958 And you also have to
08:55:18.680 import meeting
08:55:22.080 uh status from
08:55:24.120 types this one. Great. So now let's go
08:55:28.318 ahead and just add these two to the
08:55:29.840 params like this. And that's it.
08:55:34.240 Now let's go ahead and let's add the UI
08:55:36.718 for these filters. So I want to prepare
08:55:39.520 from the agents UI components. In here
08:55:43.200 we have agents search filter. So let's
08:55:46.478 go ahead and copy this and uh let's go
08:55:50.318 inside of
08:55:51.718 meetings UI components and paste it
08:55:54.478 here.
08:55:55.760 Let's go ahead and rename this to be
08:55:58.440 meetings search filter. And let's rename
08:56:01.200 this to meetings search
08:56:05.080 filter. And inside of the meetings
08:56:07.440 search filter, we are going to use from
08:56:10.160 our hooks use meetings filters. And this
08:56:13.600 will be use meetings
08:56:16.600 filters. And everything else can stay
08:56:18.958 exactly the same. Yes, we probably could
08:56:21.600 have done a better job and reused this.
08:56:23.600 If you want to, you can do this as a
08:56:25.440 challenge for yourself. Find a way to
08:56:27.120 reuse the search filter since it's
08:56:29.200 exactly the same. The only difference is
08:56:31.120 the hooks. Hint, it will be controlled
08:56:34.080 from the outside of the component, not
08:56:36.080 the inside. But I already built it this
08:56:38.638 way. So, I'm just going to continue. Now
08:56:40.878 that I have the meeting search filter
08:56:42.638 using the new use meetings filter, I
08:56:44.718 will go inside of the meetings list
08:56:46.160 header here uh and I'm going to add it.
08:56:49.718 So in the to-do filters here, let's add
08:56:52.958 search filter from forward slash
08:56:56.558 meetings search filter. So now right
08:56:59.360 here when I do a refresh, I should see
08:57:02.080 filter by name. And then when I write
08:57:04.160 test, my URL has changed to this search
08:57:07.680 equals to
08:57:09.318 test. Now let's go ahead and let's build
08:57:12.000 the status filter. So this will be a new
08:57:14.318 component. So let's go inside of modules
08:57:16.398 meetings UI components. create
08:57:23.000 status-filters-filter.tsx. Let's go
08:57:24.398 ahead and import the following from
08:57:26.638 Lucid React. Circle X icon, circle check
08:57:29.760 icon, clock arrow up icon, video icon,
08:57:32.638 and loader icon. After that, we're going
08:57:35.360 to import our new command select
08:57:37.120 component, which we've built in the
08:57:38.558 previous chapter. Let's go ahead and
08:57:40.798 import the meeting status from our
08:57:42.638 types. And let's go ahead and import use
08:57:46.318 meetings filters from hooks use meetings
08:57:49.638 filters. Now we have to prepare the
08:57:51.920 options for our command select. So this
08:57:55.120 will be the following. ID of meeting
08:57:58.318 status
08:57:59.718 dotupcoming and the value of meeting
08:58:04.440 status
08:58:06.760 whoops dot upupcoming like that. and
08:58:10.878 then add a children which is a react
08:58:13.280 node. So open up a div here with a class
08:58:16.558 name flex items center gap x2 and
08:58:21.718 capitalize render clock arrow up
08:58:25.558 icon and render the actual text meeting
08:58:29.840 status upcoming. There we
08:58:33.240 go. We are now going to do the same
08:58:35.760 thing for all statuses. So after
08:58:37.600 upcoming go ahead and add completed.
08:58:40.638 It's exactly the same just using the
08:58:42.478 completed status and circle check
08:58:45.318 icon. After completed let's add active
08:58:50.000 using the active and video
08:58:53.160 icon. After active let's add processing
08:58:57.600 using the loader
08:58:59.958 icon. And finally, let's add the last
08:59:03.600 one, cancelled, using the circle X icon.
08:59:07.920 And now we can export con status filter.
08:59:11.160 Here we can grab the filters and set
08:59:14.558 filters using use meetings filters. And
08:59:19.280 we can return command
08:59:21.718 select. Inside of here, set a
08:59:24.398 placeholder to be status. Class name to
08:59:27.840 be height 9, options to be the options
08:59:31.280 constant from above. On select, we'll
08:59:34.638 very simply grab the value and set
08:59:37.878 filters with status value as meeting
08:59:42.680 status and value will be filters. status
08:59:46.558 or an empty
08:59:48.920 string. There we go.
08:59:52.718 We can now go back to the meetings list
08:59:54.798 header and we can import the status
08:59:57.040 filter
08:59:58.120 here from dot slash status filter. And
09:00:02.318 now in here when I click I am able to
09:00:04.638 select the status that I want. And you
09:00:06.798 will see that my URL is now both the
09:00:09.360 search and the status
09:00:11.000 completed. And notice that I can
09:00:13.398 actually filter right if I want to. I
09:00:16.638 can search. But notice how that works
09:00:18.958 differently than this where in here I
09:00:21.680 actually query the database. Right? So
09:00:24.958 the way this works and let me just see
09:00:28.478 is this a bug or is it just not loading
09:00:33.718 here. Looks like we have a bug here. So
09:00:37.920 I'll make sure to fix that. I will just
09:00:39.520 do a refresh just to confirm that it's
09:00:42.160 not uh something with my local
09:00:45.718 server. All right. I just restarted my
09:00:48.878 server and looks like it was just a
09:00:51.440 connection issue. Everything is working
09:00:53.280 fine with our filter here. So I can
09:00:55.600 search for new and it actually queries
09:00:57.520 the database for
09:00:59.000 new. So the reason for the different
09:01:01.440 behavior between the two is that our
09:01:04.080 status filter does not use the on
09:01:06.638 search. Whereas inside of our
09:01:11.200 uh meeting form, right, when we use the
09:01:14.240 command select, we use on search, which
09:01:17.920 basically tells the command select to
09:01:20.478 not
09:01:21.398 use the built-in filter. That's how that
09:01:24.958 works in case you were wondering. Great.
09:01:27.040 So, one more filter to build and that is
09:01:29.040 the agent ID
09:01:31.638 filter. Let's go ahead and let's go
09:01:34.638 inside of meetings UI components and
09:01:36.878 let's do agent-
09:01:41.080 ID-filter.tsx. Let's import use state
09:01:43.280 from react. Let's import use query from
09:01:45.520 tanstack query. Let's go ahead and
09:01:48.240 import use TRPC from TRPC client command
09:01:52.398 select from components command select
09:01:54.878 and generated avatar from components
09:01:57.520 generated avatar and lastly use meetings
09:02:00.760 filters. Now let's go ahead and export
09:02:03.200 const agent ID filter and as always
09:02:06.718 let's go ahead and add our filters and
09:02:09.840 set filters from use meetings filters.
09:02:14.000 Let's prepare our TRPC here.
09:02:17.280 And let's prepare the agent search and
09:02:20.240 set agent
09:02:22.520 search to be use state and an empty
09:02:25.718 string. And then we can query the data
09:02:28.080 using use query pass in tRPC agents get
09:02:32.200 many dot query options. And inside of
09:02:35.120 the query options increase the page size
09:02:37.360 to 100 and the search to be agent
09:02:40.798 search. This is basically a way to
09:02:42.798 guarantee that they can find uh their
09:02:45.520 agent, right? The pagination will not be
09:02:47.520 a problem here. And then we can go ahead
09:02:50.318 and return command
09:02:52.760 select. Let's give it a class name of
09:02:55.120 height
09:02:56.040 9. Let's go ahead and give it
09:02:58.478 placeholder of agent. And for the
09:03:01.600 options, we're going to go over data
09:03:04.160 question mark items or fall back to an
09:03:06.638 empty array map over an individual
09:03:09.080 agent. And then in here we are going to
09:03:12.638 uh return an object like like this with
09:03:16.240 an id of agent id value of agent id and
09:03:21.360 children which are going to be a react
09:03:24.000 node. So give this a class name of flex
09:03:27.280 items center and gap x of two inside a
09:03:31.280 generated avatar component and give it
09:03:34.638 the following props. seed will be agent
09:03:37.520 name, variant will be bots neutral and
09:03:39.920 class name will be size four and next to
09:03:42.798 it simply render out the agent name. The
09:03:46.160 on select will be identical as in our
09:03:49.440 status filter. So on select gets the
09:03:51.840 value and sets the filter to agent ID
09:03:54.798 for that value. And this time we're
09:03:57.440 going to have the on search prop meaning
09:03:59.280 that we are going to be using network
09:04:00.958 filtering. So on search will change and
09:04:03.600 that will re-trigger the data here
09:04:05.840 providing us with the new data inside.
09:04:08.638 And finally the value will be filters
09:04:11.280 agent ID. Perfect. Let's go inside of
09:04:14.398 the meetings list header here and let's
09:04:16.798 add the agent ID filter. Make sure to
09:04:19.680 import it from the right place. There we
09:04:22.478 go. And now you should be able to select
09:04:25.360 a filter. So for example I select this.
09:04:28.798 And now this is my URL. I have the
09:04:32.240 search test status completed and an
09:04:34.718 agent ID. And now let's add a button to
09:04:37.920 clear all of that. And then let's
09:04:39.520 finally connect it to the
09:04:42.120 API. Let's go back inside of the
09:04:44.558 meetings list header. And let's go ahead
09:04:47.520 and add filters and set filters from use
09:04:50.718 meeting filters like this. Let's go
09:04:54.398 ahead and define whether any filter is
09:04:56.718 modified. Is any filter modified if
09:05:00.478 status exists or search exists or agent
09:05:04.958 ID exists? Like that. Make sure to use
09:05:07.920 double exclamation points. And let's
09:05:10.718 also add a onclear filters method which
09:05:14.318 simply resets the filters to their
09:05:16.160 default states. Status is null. Agent ID
09:05:18.718 is an empty string. Search is an empty
09:05:20.798 string. And page as well. Perfect. So
09:05:24.638 now what we can do here is we can import
09:05:27.440 the button and we can also import X
09:05:31.120 circle icon from Lucid React and we can
09:05:35.040 go down here after the agent ID filter.
09:05:38.558 If any filter is modified, render the
09:05:40.958 button with the variant outline which
09:05:43.040 has an on click for our new method on
09:05:45.200 clear filters and render the X circle
09:05:47.440 icon which we just imported with the
09:05:49.120 clear button. So now I can click clear
09:05:51.600 and everything is reset.
09:05:54.638 In order to connect these filters, we
09:05:57.040 have to go back to our meetings UI view,
09:06:00.398 meetings view. And let's go ahead and
09:06:02.958 let's simply add the filters here. So I
09:06:06.318 will also add the router because we will
09:06:09.040 need it in a second. So let's just move
09:06:10.960 this here. And then let's also add our
09:06:14.398 filters and set filters here from use
09:06:18.519 filters, use meetings filters like this.
09:06:22.800 And then inside of the query options
09:06:24.800 here, simply spread the filters. So
09:06:27.917 already this should now start working.
09:06:31.040 If I select an agent like new one, I
09:06:33.839 will get no results here. But when I do
09:06:36.718 a hard refresh here, I'm getting this
09:06:38.480 issue unauthorized. That is of course
09:06:40.877 because our filters have not been
09:06:42.640 synchronized with the React server
09:06:44.480 component.
09:06:46.640 So before we do anything further here,
09:06:49.040 let's quickly go back to app folder
09:06:52.000 dashboard meetings page and let's go
09:06:55.680 ahead and let's
09:06:58.278 import load search params from modules
09:07:01.960 meetings. And let's go ahead and just
09:07:04.398 ask for params. There we go. And let's
09:07:08.000 also import a type search
09:07:10.917 params from Nooks server. So then we can
09:07:16.078 go ahead and create props for this page
09:07:19.519 using the promise search params. We can
09:07:22.480 then dstructure the search
09:07:25.800 params from the props here. And let's do
09:07:30.122 params await load search params search
09:07:35.078 params. If you want to, you can call
09:07:37.360 them filters. And then all you have to
09:07:40.000 do is spread the filters in the
09:07:42.078 prefetch.
09:07:44.877 There we go. So now when you refresh,
09:07:47.917 you will get no errors at all and you
09:07:50.640 can safely change your filters. That
09:07:53.438 includes the status. Everything seems to
09:07:56.320 be working exactly as we expected. Let's
09:07:59.680 just try the name test. There we go.
09:08:02.557 Works like a
09:08:04.519 charm. There's one more thing left to do
09:08:07.278 before we can end the chapter. Let's go
09:08:10.160 ahead inside of our
09:08:13.160 agents UI components and let's copy data
09:08:16.480 pagenation and let's paste it in source
09:08:20.360 components. So in the same place where
09:08:22.480 we added the data table because it's
09:08:24.320 generic enough to be reused and let's
09:08:27.040 now add it to the meetings view. So
09:08:29.360 after the data table add data pagenation
09:08:33.598 from components data
09:08:35.800 pagionation like this. And then we're
09:08:38.718 just going to go ahead and give it some
09:08:41.078 props. Page will be filters page. Total
09:08:45.839 pages will
09:08:47.718 be data. Total
09:08:50.438 pages. And on page change, we'll get the
09:08:54.320 page and set filters and simply modify
09:08:57.917 the
09:08:59.000 page like this. And for the data table,
09:09:02.557 let's add an on row. Click here to get
09:09:05.040 the row and simply do router.put
09:09:07.960 push open back takes forward slash
09:09:10.800 meetings and then row do ID and let me
09:09:14.557 just collapse this so it's more
09:09:17.800 visible. There we go. So make sure to
09:09:20.480 not misspell this. Right. Since we
09:09:22.800 already have that when you click here it
09:09:25.122 should lead you to the meeting ID page.
09:09:27.438 Perfect. So we now have working
09:09:29.278 pagionation for this as well. Let's try
09:09:31.438 it out by adding another agent
09:09:33.718 here like this.
09:09:37.122 Let's go back to the meetings and let's
09:09:39.360 go inside of our constants in the source
09:09:41.680 and change the default page size to one.
09:09:44.718 And you can see it immediately allows me
09:09:46.718 to pageionate and see the older agent.
09:09:50.237 Perfect. So you can now revert this back
09:09:52.320 to 10.
09:09:54.598 Great. One tiny problem that we have is
09:09:57.598 if you have any filter set and go inside
09:10:00.078 of mobile, you can see that this
09:10:01.839 happens. So let's go ahead and quickly
09:10:04.000 fix that. So let's go inside of
09:10:07.640 components meetings list header and wrap
09:10:11.040 this div inside of a scroll area from
09:10:14.320 components UI scroll area. So it's a
09:10:16.237 chassis and a component. You already
09:10:17.758 have it in your project. Just make sure
09:10:20.078 that you've added an import for it like
09:10:22.278 this in here. And let's go ahead and add
09:10:26.557 a inside of scroll area add a scroll bar
09:10:31.040 from components UI scroll area and give
09:10:33.199 it an orientation of
09:10:35.320 horizontal. So make sure to import
09:10:37.438 scroll bar and you can see that now this
09:10:39.839 is how it behaves. And now let's go
09:10:42.398 ahead and do the exact same thing inside
09:10:44.718 of the agents list header. So let me
09:10:47.758 just copy the import here. Let me add it
09:10:51.438 here. There we go. Uh and yeah you can
09:10:54.557 also in the meetings list if you want to
09:10:56.320 replace the magic number you can use the
09:10:58.278 default page from the constants which
09:11:01.278 will be the number
09:11:03.960 one and you also have to copy the usage
09:11:07.438 of
09:11:08.758 it. So let's just wrap this inside of
09:11:12.320 scroll
09:11:14.917 area. Add this and close scroll area.
09:11:18.960 Great. So I've just done exactly what we
09:11:22.000 did in the meetings list header to the
09:11:23.680 agents list header including the scroll
09:11:25.519 scroll area and scroll bar and I also
09:11:28.320 replaced the number one with default
09:11:31.040 page which is number one but in a
09:11:33.598 constant. So now the agents will also
09:11:37.680 have uh I mean it's not really visible
09:11:40.000 it requires a very small screen but this
09:11:42.160 is also now scrollable in case in it
09:11:44.839 overflows. Great amazing amazing job. So
09:11:48.000 that's all we wanted to do. We have done
09:11:51.040 all of these and now let's merge this
09:11:53.598 pull request. So 19 meetings
09:11:56.040 filters. I'm going to go inside of my
09:11:58.557 source control. I will change my new
09:12:01.438 branch. Create a new branch. 19 meetings
09:12:03.917 filters. Let me just double check. There
09:12:05.917 we go. And let's write a message.
09:12:08.557 Actually, first let's stage all changes.
09:12:11.917 There we go. 19 meetings filters. Let's
09:12:15.839 click commit. And let's publish the
09:12:18.598 branch. And then let's go and review our
09:12:22.800 pull
09:12:26.040 request. And now let's read the summary
09:12:28.960 of this chapter. Let's read through the
09:12:31.519 walkthrough. This update introduces a
09:12:33.758 comprehensive filtering and pagionation
09:12:35.519 to the meetings feature. It adds new
09:12:37.758 filter components, state management
09:12:39.680 hooks, and search parameter utilities.
09:12:42.320 The meeting's back end is extended to
09:12:44.398 support filtering by agent and status.
09:12:47.199 The UI now includes horizontally
09:12:49.199 scrollable filter bar, clear filter
09:12:51.640 functionality, and pageionated meeting
09:12:54.680 lists. And in here we have a sequence
09:12:57.278 diagram explaining exactly how when the
09:12:59.758 user adjusts the filter, it goes to the
09:13:01.598 meeting list header component. Using the
09:13:03.758 use meetings filters hook, we update the
09:13:06.000 filter state which in turn uh fetches
09:13:09.199 the meetings with new filters and the
09:13:11.122 pageionation and finally returns it back
09:13:13.758 to the user and no comments. So let's go
09:13:18.078 ahead and merge this pull request. We
09:13:20.078 did a very good job with this one. And
09:13:22.480 after that's done, let's go back to our
09:13:24.800 main branch and let's click synchronize
09:13:27.839 changes to ensure that we are up to
09:13:30.360 date. Perfect. After that, go inside of
09:13:33.040 your source control and confirm that you
09:13:35.278 see 19 merged to main. Amazing, amazing
09:13:40.480 job and see you in the next
09:13:43.237 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
09:13:45.839 develop the individual meeting ID page.
09:13:48.640 This will include modifying the agents
09:13:50.640 get one procedure, adding the agents
09:13:52.960 remove procedure, and adding the agent
09:13:55.360 ID page and the agent ID view. Let's
09:13:59.438 start with modifying the get one
09:14:01.122 procedure. As always, confirm that you
09:14:03.519 are on your main branch and then let's
09:14:06.000 go inside of our meetings procedures
09:14:08.839 here and find get one protected
09:14:13.237 procedure. In the select here after we
09:14:16.160 spread our get table columns, add an
09:14:18.877 agent which will be a type of agents.
09:14:21.917 And you can actually copy from get many,
09:14:25.917 right? So you can copy the duration
09:14:27.598 here. It will work exactly the same. So
09:14:31.040 just add it right here. And what we have
09:14:34.160 to add is an inner join here. So we are
09:14:37.122 only going to load this meeting if we
09:14:39.758 can find the relevant match between
09:14:42.480 meetings agent ID and agents ID for each
09:14:47.519 meeting that we are
09:14:49.800 requesting like
09:14:51.877 that. Great. So that's what we had to do
09:14:54.640 for modifying the agents get one
09:14:57.160 procedure. And now let's go ahead and
09:14:59.680 implement the remove
09:15:02.758 procedure. So I'm going to copy the
09:15:05.278 update procedure because it's quite
09:15:07.398 similar. Let's go ahead and copy it.
09:15:10.480 Let's paste it here and let's call it
09:15:13.078 remove. Inside of the input here, we are
09:15:16.000 simply going to call Z object and
09:15:18.718 request id of string like this. This
09:15:22.877 will then be removed meeting and instead
09:15:25.680 of update we will call delete remove the
09:15:29.360 dot set and find where. So where meeting
09:15:32.718 ID matches the input ID and where the
09:15:35.040 user ID matches the currently logged in
09:15:37.438 user. So we know this user has access to
09:15:40.398 modify this meeting and then let's work
09:15:43.199 with if there is no removed meeting not
09:15:45.758 found otherwise removed meeting. That's
09:15:48.877 it. That is our agents remove
09:15:52.758 procedure. Now let's go inside of the
09:15:55.122 agent ID page. We can find that in
09:15:58.718 source app folder dashboard meetings
09:16:01.680 meeting ID. And in here let's go ahead
09:16:04.877 and let's prepare the following props
09:16:07.718 params with a promise of meeting ID
09:16:11.199 inside. And make sure that you didn't
09:16:13.519 misspell meeting ID here because that's
09:16:15.917 how you will be able to access it. So be
09:16:18.557 mindful of the case sensitive items. Be
09:16:22.078 mindful of any
09:16:23.718 typos. Now let's mark this as an
09:16:26.160 asynchronous method. Let's extract the
09:16:28.237 props and let's get the params
09:16:32.199 here. Then let's go ahead and let's
09:16:35.519 extract meeting ID from 08
09:16:39.000 params. Then let's go ahead and let's
09:16:41.438 add our session protection here. So
09:16:44.398 let's import out from lib out. Let's
09:16:48.398 import headers from next headers. And
09:16:51.278 let's import a redirect from next
09:16:56.040 navigation. Once you've added that,
09:16:58.320 let's go ahead and prefetch the
09:17:01.278 individual meeting. So let's get query
09:17:04.160 client from get query client. You can
09:17:08.320 import this from ERPC server and then
09:17:12.718 void query client refetch query ERPC
09:17:18.917 meetings get one query options and pass
09:17:23.519 in the ID to be meeting
09:17:27.160 ID. Add a to-do
09:17:34.040 refcript. Meetings get transcript. This
09:17:36.960 doesn't exist yet. We are later going to
09:17:38.960 implement it. Now let's add hydration
09:17:41.839 boundary here. Let's add state to be
09:17:44.680 dehydrate and pass in the query client.
09:17:47.917 You can import hydration boundary and
09:17:50.000 dehydrate all from tanstack react query.
09:17:53.839 Now in here add a suspense from
09:17:59.398 react. Then add error boundary from
09:18:03.122 react. error
09:18:06.519 boundary. Now let's go ahead and assign
09:18:09.040 the fallback
09:18:11.078 here and let's just do
09:18:14.199 to-do. Make sure to import suspense from
09:18:17.519 React and error boundary from React
09:18:20.078 error
09:18:21.320 boundary. Now let's implement the
09:18:23.519 meeting ID view component. So I'm going
09:18:26.237 to go inside of my modules meetings UI
09:18:30.000 views and I will create meeting ID
09:18:34.278 viewtsx like this. Let's go ahead and
09:18:37.438 create a interface here. Props meeting
09:18:40.598 ID. Let's export const ID view right
09:18:45.438 here.
09:18:47.758 Let's dstructure the
09:18:50.519 props meeting
09:18:53.718 ID like this.
09:18:57.040 Then let's go ahead inside of here. And
09:18:59.598 let's return a fragment. And let's
09:19:03.438 return a div here with a class name.
09:19:06.557 Flex one py4 px4
09:19:10.519 mdpx8 flex flex column and gap y of 4
09:19:15.840 meeting ID view.
09:19:19.840 Then let's go back to the page and let's
09:19:21.916 replace this with meeting ID view and
09:19:24.880 pass in the meeting ID. Meeting ID. Make
09:19:28.640 sure to import this from modules
09:19:30.480 meetings UI views meeting ID view. And
09:19:33.520 now when you click on an individual
09:19:35.436 meeting here let's just do a
09:19:37.400 refresh. You should see the new meeting
09:19:40.160 ID
09:19:41.800 view. Now let's go back inside of the
09:19:44.240 meeting ID view. Let's prepare TRPC from
09:19:47.596 use TRPC from TRPC client and let's
09:19:51.120 extract the data from use suspense
09:19:54.680 query individual use suspense query from
09:19:57.680 tanstack react query pass in the RPC
09:20:01.080 meetings get one query options and pass
09:20:04.800 in the meeting the ID as meeting
09:20:08.276 ID like that. Now that you have that,
09:20:12.480 let's go ahead and do a JSON stringify
09:20:16.560 data null
09:20:19.240 2. So let's go ahead and refresh. Let's
09:20:22.480 go uh inside
09:20:24.276 of meetings
09:20:26.756 here. Let's click here. Okay, seems like
09:20:29.756 something is wrong here. Instead of
09:20:32.800 meeting ID view, we need to mark it as
09:20:35.040 use client. That's it. That's what we
09:20:37.276 forgot to do. Let's refresh now. And
09:20:40.240 there we go. Perfect. Now let's build
09:20:43.520 the error and loading
09:20:45.720 states. So these are identical as to all
09:20:49.200 the other places we've used them. So
09:20:51.916 meeting ID view loading using the
09:20:53.756 loading state and meeting ID view error
09:20:56.320 using the error state. You can import
09:20:58.400 the loading state from components
09:20:59.916 loading state and the error state from
09:21:01.840 components error state. The title
09:21:04.160 loading meeting. This may take a few
09:21:06.240 seconds and error loading meeting.
09:21:07.840 Please try again later. And here I have
09:21:10.000 both of those components added. Now that
09:21:12.800 you have that added, you can go back
09:21:14.240 inside of the page here and instead of
09:21:16.080 using to-do, you can now use meeting ID
09:21:19.120 view
09:21:20.276 loading. And in here you can use meeting
09:21:24.160 ID view
09:21:26.120 error like this. And let's just import
09:21:29.400 it. Make sure to add all three meeting
09:21:32.560 ID view the error and the loading. So
09:21:36.000 now when you refresh you will have
09:21:37.680 proper loading here and we've already
09:21:39.680 demonstrated error a couple of times. So
09:21:41.756 no need to do it
09:21:44.040 again. Now let's go ahead and let's copy
09:21:47.120 from the agents UI components in here.
09:21:51.520 Uh we have agent ID view header. Let's
09:21:54.800 copy that. Let's paste it inside of
09:21:57.040 meetings UI components.
09:21:59.756 And let's go ahead and rename this from
09:22:02.960 agent ID view header to meeting ID view
09:22:06.840 header. And in case you think that we
09:22:09.840 forgot to rename this one, no, this is
09:22:12.160 our filter for filtering by agent. So
09:22:15.520 this needs to be called agent ID even
09:22:17.276 though it's in the meetings module. So
09:22:19.120 let's go inside of our new meeting ID
09:22:21.040 view header and let's modify the props a
09:22:23.596 bit. So instead of agent ID and agent
09:22:26.080 name, we will have meeting ID and
09:22:28.640 meeting name. So let's go ahead and use
09:22:30.880 that
09:22:33.000 here.
09:22:34.916 Meeting. So let's use the meeting ID
09:22:37.436 here and the href will be forward slash
09:22:40.596 meetings and here as well meetings and
09:22:43.120 this will be my meetings and this will
09:22:45.756 be meeting
09:22:48.040 name. And I think that everything else
09:22:50.400 can stay exactly the same except of
09:22:52.640 course meeting ID view header component
09:22:57.160 name. Perfect. So now we can go back
09:23:00.000 inside of the meeting ID view here and
09:23:03.436 let's go ahead inside of this div render
09:23:06.720 the header component. Uh
09:23:10.680 meeting ID view
09:23:13.960 header. Let's do meeting ID view header.
09:23:18.080 And inside of here, go ahead and pass
09:23:21.596 the following. So the meeting ID can be
09:23:25.436 simply meeting ID prop. Meeting name
09:23:28.960 will be data dot name and on edit here
09:23:34.880 will just be an empty arrow function and
09:23:37.756 on remove will be an empty arrow
09:23:39.756 function. Let's see what the issue is
09:23:42.436 here. So uh my apologies meeting
09:23:48.200 ID view header that's the component uh I
09:23:52.000 wanted to add the new one which we just
09:23:54.800 copied and modified. So now when you
09:23:57.520 refresh here your individual meeting ID
09:24:00.720 should now have a familiar looking
09:24:03.480 header. So you can navigate back to all
09:24:07.480 meetings or you can open the dropdown to
09:24:10.800 edit and
09:24:13.160 delete. Now let's implement the delete
09:24:16.240 functionality here. So that will be
09:24:18.640 quite simple. Let's go inside of the
09:24:20.480 meeting ID view here and we have to
09:24:23.200 prepare const remove meeting from use
09:24:27.400 mutation. You can get this from TRPC.
09:24:30.880 Oh, my apologies. From tanstack react
09:24:32.800 query inside add TRPC meetings remove
09:24:37.520 and add query options
09:24:40.360 here. Let me just see mutation options
09:24:43.680 like
09:24:44.520 this. Add on success
09:24:48.276 here and on
09:24:50.840 error like
09:24:53.240 this. Now let's also prepare the query
09:24:56.240 client here. use query client. You can
09:25:00.480 import this from tanstack react query.
09:25:04.000 And inside of the onsuccess, we are
09:25:06.160 going to invalidate uh meetings get
09:25:09.720 many like this. And let's add to-do
09:25:13.960 invalidate free tier
09:25:16.840 usage. And then let's also add router
09:25:20.240 here. Use router from next navigation.
09:25:22.720 So make sure you import
09:25:25.640 this like
09:25:27.480 that. And after we do this, let's do
09:25:30.400 router push forward/ meetings. So after
09:25:32.960 we remove it, we get redirected back to
09:25:34.960 the meetings here. And on error, we can
09:25:37.436 get the error. And we can do toast from
09:25:39.960 sonar. Error data
09:25:43.400 message. Uh let's do
09:25:47.240 error.data. Uh it looks like we don't
09:25:49.756 have any code in this one. Let's just
09:25:51.756 not do uh the error for this one. Now uh
09:25:55.360 let's go ahead and add our use confirm
09:25:58.120 hook which we can now reuse. So in here
09:26:01.756 I will add this remove confirmation and
09:26:04.560 confirm remove coming from the use
09:26:06.400 confirm
09:26:07.560 hook and it has two parameters. First
09:26:10.400 one are you sure and the second one the
09:26:12.320 following action will remove this
09:26:13.756 meeting and use confirm can be imported
09:26:16.240 from here. And let's remove the toast
09:26:18.080 soner here in case you've had it. And
09:26:21.200 let's go ahead and add this here like
09:26:25.960 that. And now let's go ahead and let's
09:26:28.640 implement the handle remove
09:26:31.320 meeting. So handle remove meeting is an
09:26:33.840 asynchronous method which is going to
09:26:36.000 await confirm remove from our use
09:26:38.560 confirm hook and only if we get okay are
09:26:41.756 we going to await remove meeting
09:26:43.960 mutation. So now we can handle that and
09:26:46.560 pass it here like that. And now if you
09:26:50.640 want to you can go ahead and try it out.
09:26:52.480 Click delete and you have a
09:26:53.916 confirmation. Once you hit confirm this
09:26:56.080 will get deleted and you are redirected
09:26:58.080 back to the meetings
09:27:00.120 page. Now let's also implement the edit
09:27:03.756 functionality. So this will be quite
09:27:06.120 simple. Let's go ahead and let's copy
09:27:08.800 the new meeting dialogue and let's
09:27:11.360 rename it to update meeting dialogue.
09:27:15.596 inside of here. Rename it to update
09:27:18.880 meeting dialogue as well and add one
09:27:21.360 more initial value prop here to be a
09:27:24.800 type of meeting get one and I think we
09:27:27.520 already have it from the types. So we do
09:27:29.840 so this is the get one
09:27:32.360 output like that. Go ahead and structure
09:27:35.596 the initial value here. Uh this will be
09:27:38.880 initial values not initial value like
09:27:41.840 that. And then inside of here, this will
09:27:44.720 be edit meeting. And this will be edit
09:27:49.120 the meeting
09:27:51.000 details. And meeting form in here uh is
09:27:55.360 not going to have a redirect. So it's
09:27:58.000 just going to be an open on change. And
09:28:00.880 oh yeah, we have to fix this and set
09:28:02.560 this to false. And pass the initial
09:28:04.800 values here to be initial values like
09:28:06.960 that. And we can do this simpler like
09:28:10.640 this.
09:28:12.480 And while you are here, uh, remove the
09:28:16.080 router, remove this. Go inside of your
09:28:19.520 new meeting dialogue and simply fix this
09:28:23.040 to be false. So you can close that
09:28:25.320 dialogue. Great. Now, let's go ahead and
09:28:28.240 let's render the update meeting dialogue
09:28:31.756 inside of the meeting ID view. And let's
09:28:35.276 go ahead and prepare our set state here.
09:28:38.720 So I'm just going to put it here. So
09:28:41.436 const update meeting dialogue open and
09:28:43.596 set update meeting dialogue open all
09:28:46.160 from use state which you can import from
09:28:49.520 react like
09:28:51.480 that. Now let's go ahead and use
09:28:55.560 this right here in the update meeting
09:28:58.240 dialogue. So open will be update meeting
09:29:02.276 dialogue open like that. And we're going
09:29:06.560 to have on open change to be set update
09:29:10.240 meeting dialogue open. And the initial
09:29:12.320 values will be
09:29:14.436 data. Uh and make sure to import this
09:29:19.200 update meeting dialogue from components
09:29:21.756 update meeting dialogue. And one more
09:29:25.040 thing we have to do is set update
09:29:26.960 meeting dialogue open in the header
09:29:29.080 here. So meeting edu header on edit set
09:29:32.320 this to true. So now this meeting is
09:29:36.080 called test as you can clearly see here.
09:29:39.120 But if I click edit uh you can see how
09:29:41.840 it also populates the agent. But if I
09:29:43.680 call it test two and click
09:29:46.276 update it should rename to test two and
09:29:49.680 it does. And if I go back it's called
09:29:51.756 test two. So that's all thanks to the
09:29:54.560 work we did when we initially developed
09:29:57.040 uh the meeting form. So it automatically
09:30:00.240 uses update meeting and it refetches
09:30:03.276 itself and get many as well. Great,
09:30:07.596 amazing, amazing job. Uh so I'm going to
09:30:11.120 stop this chapter here and then in the
09:30:12.880 next one we're going to focus on the UI
09:30:15.520 inside of here and we can start the call
09:30:18.000 very very soon. Perfect. Let's go ahead
09:30:20.560 and merge this. So, I'm going to go
09:30:23.436 ahead and open a branch 20 meeting page.
09:30:28.240 Create new branch 20 meeting
09:30:31.240 page. I'm going to go ahead and stage
09:30:34.240 all of these changes. 20 meeting page. I
09:30:38.080 will commit and I will publish the
09:30:40.360 branch. Now, let's go ahead and let's
09:30:43.276 review our changes by opening a new pull
09:30:47.960 request. And here we have our chapter
09:30:51.040 summary. We added the ability to delete
09:30:53.520 meetings. We introduced an enhanced
09:30:55.680 meeting detail view with improved
09:30:57.520 loading and error handling. And we added
09:31:00.160 a header component to the meeting detail
09:31:02.320 view with options to edit or delete the
09:31:05.120 meeting as well as a new dialogue for
09:31:07.436 editing meeting details. We also did
09:31:10.320 some bug fixing such as uh the issue
09:31:13.360 where cancelling the new meeting
09:31:14.560 dialogue did not properly close the
09:31:16.756 dialogue. Great. So in here we have a
09:31:19.200 more in-depth walk through and in here
09:31:21.520 we have a sequence diagram but nothing
09:31:24.000 new is really shown here because we did
09:31:26.560 this exact thing uh when we developed
09:31:30.560 the agent ID view right and in here we
09:31:34.240 have some comments such as to implement
09:31:36.640 to-do which we are definitely going to
09:31:38.320 do once we get to the premium chapter uh
09:31:41.200 I mean the chapter where we add premium
09:31:43.680 features to our app and in here uh It's
09:31:47.916 telling us to be mindful of
09:31:50.040 accessibility. So yeah, we could look
09:31:52.960 into this even though I think ChatSen
09:31:54.800 handles that by
09:31:56.276 itself in here. It does not have the
09:31:59.520 most up-to-date information. So next
09:32:01.520 headers does return a promise. So
09:32:04.240 headers needs to be awaited. So this is
09:32:06.720 an incorrect suggestion in this case.
09:32:09.360 Same thing for params. So this is new.
09:32:12.240 It wasn't like that before. But now the
09:32:14.960 new version is params is a promise and
09:32:18.400 you need to await
09:32:19.960 it. Uh and in here same thing. So this
09:32:23.360 is a completely new way of prefetching
09:32:25.436 with TRPC. So it thinks it needs to be
09:32:27.276 await. No, it needs to be a void.
09:32:31.400 Perfect. Great. So now let's go ahead
09:32:34.080 and let's merge this pull request.
09:32:37.436 And after it's merged, let's go back to
09:32:40.000 our main branch and let's click
09:32:42.400 synchronize changes and
09:32:45.240 okay. Let's then go inside of our source
09:32:48.240 control graph and confirm that we just
09:32:50.720 merged 20 meeting page with all of the
09:32:53.916 changes we just reviewed. Amazing,
09:32:56.880 amazing job and see you in the next
09:33:00.276 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
09:33:02.960 add meeting varants. This will be
09:33:06.080 cancelled, processing, active,
09:33:08.320 completed, and
09:33:10.040 upcoming. So, let's go ahead and ensure
09:33:13.040 that you're on your default branch.
09:33:15.520 After that, go inside of the meeting ID
09:33:18.400 view inside of modules meetings UI views
09:33:22.560 meeting ID view. And in here, go ahead
09:33:27.040 and add the following
09:33:31.320 constants. And instead of using meeting
09:33:34.240 we are directly accessing the data like
09:33:36.800 this. So is active is upcoming is
09:33:40.400 canceled is completed and is processing.
09:33:43.520 And in here you don't have to be afraid
09:33:45.436 of doing a typo because you will get an
09:33:47.756 error because data.status is an enum
09:33:51.040 because data is what we fret from our
09:33:54.000 database right. So it can only be a
09:33:56.880 specific thing that we defined in our
09:33:58.960 schema. So just go ahead and add these
09:34:02.680 values and now let's go ahead and use
09:34:05.120 them to render the current state. So
09:34:07.200 remove the JSON stringify here and check
09:34:09.916 if is cancelled. Let's go ahead and
09:34:13.320 render a
09:34:15.880 div
09:34:19.560 cancel like this. And then let's go
09:34:22.400 ahead and repeat that for all
09:34:24.756 states like this. So he's canceled,
09:34:27.436 cancelled, processing, processing,
09:34:29.276 completed, completed, and upcoming,
09:34:31.720 upcoming. So right now when you visit
09:34:34.000 your meeting, you should see its state
09:34:37.040 here. There we go. Now it says upcoming.
09:34:40.080 But if I go inside of my Neon console
09:34:42.160 here, inside of tables, meetings, and if
09:34:45.360 I change the status to processing, for
09:34:48.000 example, and click save and refresh
09:34:50.640 here, it will now say processing. So
09:34:54.240 let's go ahead and just quickly uh bring
09:34:56.880 it back to upcoming so we can develop
09:35:00.480 that
09:35:02.360 component. Before we can develop any
09:35:04.720 components, we first have to fetch the
09:35:06.880 rest of our assets. So you can go ahead
09:35:09.360 and visit
09:35:14.040 cwantonio.com/meat-assets or you can
09:35:15.520 simply use the link in the description
09:35:17.520 and that will take you to the GitHub
09:35:19.916 with all of the assets. So, go ahead and
09:35:22.720 download all of this. You can click
09:35:24.400 individual inside of them and use the
09:35:26.400 download button right
09:35:28.916 here. Once you've downloaded them, go
09:35:31.916 ahead and put them inside of the public
09:35:34.480 folder. So, we already did this with the
09:35:37.120 empty SVG, and now we're just adding a
09:35:40.400 couple of more. So, we've added the
09:35:42.720 cancelled, we've added processing, and
09:35:46.400 we've added upcoming.
09:35:50.000 Now let's go ahead and just close
09:35:52.240 everything and go inside of source
09:35:54.000 components empty state and in here add a
09:35:56.960 new prop which is an optional image prop
09:36:00.400 and make it a default forward slash
09:36:02.960 empty SVG and instead of rendering the
09:36:05.756 hardcoded string here put it like
09:36:09.320 this and now let's go ahead and develop
09:36:12.320 upcoming state so we're going to do that
09:36:14.960 inside of the meetings UI components
09:36:17.596 let's create a new file
09:36:19.276 upcoming state.tsx.
09:36:23.756 Let's go ahead and let's export const
09:36:26.080 upcoming
09:36:28.040 state and let's return a div with a
09:36:31.040 class name background white rounded
09:36:34.080 large px of 4 py of 5 flex flex column
09:36:39.756 gap y8 items center and justify center
09:36:45.276 inside render the empty state from
09:36:48.240 components empty state and inside put an
09:36:52.000 image to be forward upcoming
09:36:56.040 SVG. So, we just added that to our
09:36:58.640 public folder. And then let's add uh the
09:37:02.080 title and the description. This is what
09:37:04.320 I'm going to use. You can, of course,
09:37:05.916 use whatever you prefer. So, let's go
09:37:08.720 ahead now and go back inside of our
09:37:12.160 views meeting ID view. And instead of
09:37:15.360 this upcoming let's actually render
09:37:17.436 upcoming
09:37:19.480 state from components upcoming state. So
09:37:23.680 now in here when you refresh if this is
09:37:25.916 in the state upcoming you should see not
09:37:28.560 started yet. Once you start this meeting
09:37:30.640 a summary will appear
09:37:33.080 here. Now let's go back inside of the
09:37:35.916 upcoming state here. And let's import
09:37:39.276 button from components UI button. And
09:37:43.040 let's import
09:37:44.880 uh
09:37:46.436 link from next link. And let's also add
09:37:50.960 video icon and ban icon from lucid
09:37:56.200 react. And now we're going to go ahead
09:37:59.276 below the empty state here and we're
09:38:01.756 going to open a div with a class name
09:38:04.960 flex flex column reverse lg flex row lg
09:38:11.520 justify center items center gap 2 and
09:38:16.480 full width. And now let's render the
09:38:19.040 buttons. The first one will be ban icon
09:38:22.960 and cancel meeting button. Copy and
09:38:26.240 paste it. And the second one will be
09:38:28.080 start meeting and video
09:38:30.840 icon. And this one will also be a link.
09:38:34.960 So go ahead and wrap the content of the
09:38:37.596 button inside a
09:38:39.960 link and give it an
09:38:42.276 href to the following open back forward
09:38:47.276 call forward
09:38:48.756 slash and then we're going to do meeting
09:38:51.840 ID. So let's just put one two three for
09:38:53.916 now. set the this to be as child and
09:38:58.160 class name with full LG with auto and
09:39:03.120 that would be
09:39:04.436 it. And now let's go ahead to the button
09:39:08.240 above and let's go ahead and give it a
09:39:10.880 variant of secondary and let's give it
09:39:14.080 the same class name here. There we go.
09:39:16.880 And now let's go ahead and let's simply
09:39:18.480 extend the props for this. So it will
09:39:22.320 accept meeting ID on cancel meeting and
09:39:25.040 is cancelling. So we can now destructure
09:39:28.640 that. Let's go ahead and do it. Meeting
09:39:32.160 ID on cancel meeting and is cancelling
09:39:35.040 from the props here. So for this button
09:39:39.200 here, we can go ahead and add an on
09:39:43.320 click and we can go ahead and add
09:39:47.800 disabled if it's cancelling.
09:39:52.480 And we can also disable the start
09:39:54.560 meeting button as well if is cancelling
09:39:57.436 so we don't accidentally start the call
09:40:00.240 while we're canceling it. Now let's go
09:40:04.000 ahead and also use the meeting ID here
09:40:05.840 instead of the 1 2 3. So forward
09:40:08.436 slall meeting ID like that. Now let's go
09:40:12.240 inside of the actual meeting ID
09:40:15.400 here and let's render it properly. So
09:40:18.560 I'm going to give it meeting ID. Meeting
09:40:21.756 ID on cancel meeting will be an arrow
09:40:24.640 function like this. And in is cancelling
09:40:26.960 will be
09:40:28.120 false. There we
09:40:31.800 go. So now we have the options to cancel
09:40:34.640 or start the
09:40:36.596 meeting. Now let's leave it like this
09:40:39.360 and let's go ahead and let's add a new
09:40:43.560 state called active state.
09:40:48.480 So in order to do that we just have to
09:40:51.120 copy the upcoming state and let's go
09:40:53.436 ahead and let's rename it active state
09:40:56.640 and for the props it will just accept a
09:40:59.040 meeting ID let's call it active state
09:41:02.160 and all we have to do is just modify the
09:41:04.160 title and the description
09:41:05.960 here meeting is active and meeting will
09:41:09.040 end once all participants have left and
09:41:11.680 we can use the exact same image here and
09:41:14.640 you can remove this div here. No need
09:41:17.520 for it. And uh yeah, you can leave the
09:41:20.560 class name as it is. Just remove the
09:41:22.160 unused imports here. And uh yeah, my
09:41:25.960 apologies. Bring this back. But it's
09:41:28.320 just going to be a single button
09:41:31.240 here. It's not going to be disabled. It
09:41:34.080 will be a link to the meeting ID. And
09:41:36.240 this will be join meeting like that.
09:41:40.160 Perfect. And I think we can leave
09:41:42.000 everything else exactly as it is. So
09:41:43.680 meeting is active. Meet will end. and
09:41:46.240 just remove the ban icon from here.
09:41:48.320 Perfect. Let's go back to the meeting ID
09:41:50.320 view here. And let's go ahead and let's
09:41:53.596 add is active and active
09:41:57.800 state. Meeting
09:41:59.960 ID. Meeting
09:42:02.276 ID. Make sure to import active state. So
09:42:06.160 now let's go ahead and let's change this
09:42:08.160 to active and click save
09:42:11.720 change. And let's see this change.
09:42:14.480 meeting is active and we have a button
09:42:16.160 to join the meeting which is a 404 page
09:42:19.120 at the moment because it doesn't exist
09:42:21.880 yet. And now let's wrap it up with the
09:42:24.720 processing state and the cancelled
09:42:26.960 state. So let's copy active state and
09:42:29.596 let's rename it canceled
09:42:32.360 state. Let's go ahead and remove the
09:42:34.400 props as we are not going to need any.
09:42:37.040 And let's rename this to
09:42:39.000 cancelled state. In here we are using
09:42:42.560 cancelled SVG and we just have to modify
09:42:46.240 the title and the description and we can
09:42:48.880 completely remove everything below that.
09:42:52.400 And let's remove all of the unused
09:42:54.160 imports here. So that's the canceled
09:42:56.560 state. So let's go inside of the meeting
09:42:58.240 ID view down here and let's go ahead and
09:43:01.916 render the canceled
09:43:04.680 state. Make sure to import the cancelled
09:43:07.480 state. And let's go ahead and change
09:43:09.916 this to cancelled. Save
09:43:12.360 change. And let's refresh and see it in
09:43:15.360 action. There we go. Meeting
09:43:18.276 cancelled. And let's do one more which
09:43:21.040 is the processing state. So let's just
09:43:23.680 copy
09:43:24.916 the cancelled
09:43:27.560 state. And let's rename it to processing
09:43:32.360 state. Processing state. So we're in
09:43:36.720 here. We're going to use u processing
09:43:39.520 SVG I think public processing. Yeah. So
09:43:43.756 we have processing SVG here and but this
09:43:46.880 is technically a completed state right
09:43:50.320 we are going to say meeting completed
09:43:52.080 because it was literally completed we
09:43:54.000 are just processing it. So like a
09:43:55.680 summary will appear soon. Great. And now
09:43:58.960 let's go back inside of the meeting ID
09:44:00.800 view here and let's use
09:44:03.080 the processing state like this. There we
09:44:08.360 go. Perfect. So the only thing left is
09:44:12.000 the completed state. But this will not
09:44:15.520 use any image. This will be an actual
09:44:17.520 you know completed state with
09:44:18.880 information and we can only develop it
09:44:20.560 once we actually process a meeting. But
09:44:23.680 let's just confirm this works by
09:44:25.276 changing this to processing and saving
09:44:27.680 it and
09:44:28.756 refreshing. And there we go. Meeting
09:44:31.276 completed. The meeting was completed. A
09:44:33.120 summary will appear soon. Perfect. So
09:44:35.596 now just bring this back to upcoming or
09:44:38.080 just create a new meeting. It's going to
09:44:40.000 have upcoming by default. And in the
09:44:42.320 next chapter, we are going to enable
09:44:44.320 this buttons right here. Now let's go
09:44:47.200 ahead and let's see if we've done
09:44:49.560 everything. We've grabbed the assets.
09:44:51.916 Cancelled processing active. Uh not
09:44:54.400 completed yet, but we did add this.
09:44:59.320 Perfect. And now let's go ahead and
09:45:01.360 merge this. So 21 meeting
09:45:05.320 variants. Let me go ahead and open a new
09:45:08.000 branch here. Create new branch. 21
09:45:10.800 meeting
09:45:14.436 variants. And let's click plus to stage
09:45:17.276 all changes. And add a commit message.
09:45:21.436 and let's press commit and publish the
09:45:24.520 branch. Once the branch has been
09:45:26.800 published, we can go ahead and review
09:45:29.360 our code. This one was pretty simple, so
09:45:31.680 I'm not expecting much, but I am
09:45:34.240 interested if we missed some uh serious
09:45:37.360 issues
09:45:39.000 here. And in here we have our code
09:45:41.960 summary. So, as we've just learned, we
09:45:45.040 have introduced new visual states,
09:45:47.200 active, upcoming, canceled, and
09:45:49.596 processing. And we have also added the
09:45:52.320 images to represent those states. In
09:45:55.360 here, as always, we have a more uh
09:45:58.160 in-depth file by file change summary, a
09:46:01.596 diagram representing our logic to show
09:46:04.560 each visual state. And in here, we have
09:46:08.160 some comments. So, it recommends using
09:46:10.560 active SVG instead of upcoming SVG.
09:46:13.520 Completely reasonable. It's not exactly
09:46:15.680 clear. The component is called active
09:46:17.680 state, but upcoming. SVG is the one we
09:46:20.960 need to use. In here, it suggests adding
09:46:24.640 some class names here, but we don't need
09:46:26.720 to do that because in the new chat
09:46:28.720 versions, button automatically separates
09:46:31.436 the icons
09:46:33.000 here. And let's go ahead
09:46:36.756 here. Uh it suggests removing the
09:46:39.840 meeting on cancel. We are going to have
09:46:41.916 an actual action to just cancel the
09:46:43.840 meeting without removing it.
09:46:46.240 Uh, of course in here it suggests
09:46:49.120 actually, you know, filling this and
09:46:51.040 also it suggests adding an unknown
09:46:53.200 meeting status. So that's something we
09:46:54.800 might actually do. Even though I'm not
09:46:56.320 sure how this can happen, it's good to
09:46:58.640 cover this kind of case as well. So
09:47:01.200 let's go ahead and merge this pull
09:47:03.200 request
09:47:04.360 here. Let's go back to our main branch
09:47:08.160 and let's click synchronize changes. So
09:47:11.756 this button right here. And let's go
09:47:14.640 back inside of our source control, look
09:47:16.880 at the graph, and confirm we just merged
09:47:19.596 all of those new images and all of those
09:47:22.640 new states. Great. That's it for this
09:47:25.436 chapter. Amazing job, and see you in the
09:47:27.596 next
09:47:28.840 one. In this chapter, our goal is to
09:47:31.916 implement a video calls. The plan for
09:47:34.880 that is to start by obtaining stream API
09:47:37.756 keys, adding the stream video and node
09:47:41.000 SDK, adding a few methods, procedures,
09:47:44.800 and finally UI elements. Let's start by
09:47:48.160 obtain obtaining the stream API keys.
09:47:50.960 So, visit
09:47:52.436 getstream.io and create an account. If
09:47:55.360 this is your first time, you will have a
09:47:58.000 prompt like this where you have to enter
09:48:00.160 a unique organization name. So, I'm
09:48:02.880 going to call this meet- AI. And I'm
09:48:06.080 just going to go ahead and give it a
09:48:08.000 number to make it unique. Let's click
09:48:10.320 save. And there we go. Our organization
09:48:13.040 was just created. And in here, we also
09:48:16.160 have our production app. In case you
09:48:18.560 don't have an app, you can click create
09:48:20.596 app. So, go ahead in your existing app
09:48:23.596 or your newly created one. And in here,
09:48:26.960 go ahead and select video and audio and
09:48:29.756 click overview. And now inside of here,
09:48:32.880 make sure you are in video and audio and
09:48:35.276 copy the
09:48:36.596 key. Now let's go ahead. Make sure you
09:48:39.276 are on your default branch. Go inside of
09:48:42.000 environment and let's add next public
09:48:45.436 stream video API
09:48:48.120 key and below that prepare the stream
09:48:52.160 video secret key which will be this
09:48:55.200 secret right here. So copy that secret
09:48:57.916 and add it here.
09:49:00.640 After we've obtained our keys, let's
09:49:02.800 install the SDK. So, I want to show you
09:49:05.840 where you can find the documentation.
09:49:08.080 And it's quite simple. You can just
09:49:09.596 click view documentation here. Just make
09:49:12.080 sure you have video and audio
09:49:14.120 open. And in here, go ahead and select
09:49:17.436 the platform API and select JavaScript.
09:49:21.840 Let's go ahead and install stream.io
09:49:24.080 node
09:49:25.960 SDK. So, npm install and just add legacy
09:49:30.080 pure depths so the installation doesn't
09:49:34.360 fail. Now that it's installed, let's go
09:49:37.360 ahead back inside of our project source
09:49:40.080 library and create stream-vide.ts.
09:49:46.000 Let's go ahead and let's import stream
09:49:49.000 client from at stream io node SDK and
09:49:54.080 export constream video to be new stream
09:49:57.720 client. And inside of here we need to
09:50:00.560 pass our new environment keys which are
09:50:04.560 process environment next public stream
09:50:07.520 video API key and stream video secret
09:50:10.000 key. As always, please double check,
09:50:12.560 copy and paste so you know you didn't
09:50:14.800 add any typos.
09:50:18.200 Great. For extra security, you can also
09:50:21.520 import server only in the beginning. You
09:50:24.560 already have this installed server only.
09:50:26.880 And let me just show you my stream io
09:50:30.000 node SDK version in case you're
09:50:32.436 wondering. So, this will basically
09:50:34.640 prevent this from being imported
09:50:36.640 anywhere on the client side.
09:50:39.200 Now, let's divert a bit and let's go
09:50:42.480 create the generate avatar method. So,
09:50:45.680 we're going to do that inside of source
09:50:47.520 lib and create
09:50:49.320 avatar.
09:50:51.800 DSX and import create avatar from dice
09:50:55.120 bear core. And let's add our two
09:50:57.680 variants here. Now, let's go ahead and
09:51:00.480 create the props seed, which is a
09:51:02.880 string, and the
09:51:04.436 variant. They need to match the imports
09:51:07.000 above. And then in here create a very
09:51:10.000 simple method generate avatar URI
09:51:13.596 accepting the seed and variant props.
09:51:15.916 And what we are doing is calling the
09:51:18.000 create avatar method depending on the
09:51:19.916 variant and we are passing some specific
09:51:22.800 options if it's initials. If it's bots
09:51:25.756 neutral we are just passing the seed and
09:51:28.080 we are returning to data URI. So this is
09:51:31.040 a quick way to generate avatar URIs but
09:51:34.480 not the entire component as we have with
09:51:37.040 our generated avatar component. So it's
09:51:39.276 pretty much the exact same function and
09:51:41.680 we could probably reuse it here if we
09:51:43.916 wanted to feel free to do that but this
09:51:46.400 one doesn't render any
09:51:49.640 JSX. Now let's go ahead inside of our
09:51:52.800 meetings procedures located in modules
09:51:55.756 meetings server procedures and let's go
09:51:58.080 to the top here and let's create
09:52:00.080 generate token procedure. It's going to
09:52:03.120 be a protected
09:52:05.320 procedure. Go ahead and add a mutation
09:52:08.120 here. Make it
09:52:10.520 asynchronous. Extract the context from
09:52:13.360 here. And what you're going to do is
09:52:16.120 await stream video from our newly added
09:52:20.640 lib stream video. And in here add upsert
09:52:26.756 users. And in here open an object and
09:52:30.720 set the ID for this new user to be the
09:52:33.596 currently logged in user. Give it a name
09:52:37.520 for the currently logged in user. A role
09:52:40.480 will be admin and image will either be
09:52:44.800 context out user image or our newly
09:52:49.520 created generate avatar URI from lib
09:52:55.000 avatar and let's go ahead and pass it
09:52:57.436 some options here. So we are going to
09:53:00.560 use seed to be context out user name and
09:53:04.880 variant will be initials.
09:53:08.720 There we go. So now we have prepared a
09:53:11.680 user for the call. Now we have to create
09:53:14.880 the actual token. So let's create the
09:53:17.276 expiration time using this formula which
09:53:20.560 is equivalent to 1 hour. And let's go
09:53:23.916 ahead and create the issued at using
09:53:26.880 this formula right here. And then we can
09:53:29.840 finally create the token using stream
09:53:32.160 video generate user token. pass in the
09:53:36.560 user id to be context al user id. So
09:53:40.960 this will now create a token for which
09:53:43.680 user can join the call and it's going to
09:53:45.840 match the user ID of this user which we
09:53:48.720 just added to the list of members. So
09:53:50.880 it's going to be able to read their
09:53:52.560 image and their name even though the
09:53:55.276 token only knows the ID of that user.
09:53:58.080 That's why we needed to upsert the user
09:54:00.160 first.
09:54:01.680 Now let's add the expiration to the
09:54:03.520 expiration time and the validity in
09:54:06.160 seconds to be issued
09:54:08.596 at. And since the generate user token
09:54:11.840 does not return a promise, we don't need
09:54:14.080 to await it. We can instead immediately
09:54:16.960 return this
09:54:18.840 token. Now we have to stay inside of the
09:54:21.680 meetings procedures and go inside of the
09:54:23.840 create protected procedure. And in here
09:54:26.000 we have a to-do to create stream call
09:54:28.240 and upsert some more users. Let's see
09:54:31.200 what that's all about. So first let's
09:54:33.680 create a new call using stream video dot
09:54:37.596 video call. The type of the call will be
09:54:42.200 default and the ID of the call will be
09:54:45.680 created meeting ID. So we are going to
09:54:48.160 associate the stream SDK call with our
09:54:52.720 meeting ID. So that will be our unique
09:54:55.596 identifier for this video call. And now
09:54:58.720 let's await call create. Let's go ahead
09:55:01.756 and add some data inside. This will be
09:55:04.400 created by underscore id context al user
09:55:08.756 ID. And then we're going to add some
09:55:11.436 custom fields here. So we can render
09:55:13.360 them in the call UI such as meeting ID
09:55:17.200 to be created meeting ID and meeting
09:55:20.560 name to be created meeting.name. name.
09:55:24.080 Be careful about the spelling here
09:55:25.756 because there is no type safety here.
09:55:27.916 These are our custom fields. So just
09:55:30.160 make sure you don't misspell them. And
09:55:32.560 now let's add some settings override
09:55:34.720 here. We are going to immediately enable
09:55:37.200 the transcription of the call using
09:55:39.756 English
09:55:41.320 language. Mode will be auto on and
09:55:44.640 closed caption mode will be auto on as
09:55:47.360 well. And we are going to do the same
09:55:49.520 thing with recording using mode auto on
09:55:53.120 and
09:55:54.276 quality 180 uh
09:55:57.720 1080p. There we go. So we just created a
09:56:00.640 new call every time we create a new
09:56:02.960 meeting. So we are ready to join that
09:56:05.200 call whenever we want. But we are not
09:56:07.360 done yet. What we have to do now is we
09:56:09.916 have to fetch an existing agent that
09:56:12.720 this newly created meeting uh uses. So
09:56:16.560 let's go ahead and do that. We can get
09:56:18.640 the existing agent using await database
09:56:21.200 select from agents where equals agents
09:56:24.560 ID matches the newly created meeting
09:56:27.120 agent ID. And the first thing we are
09:56:29.596 going to do is throw an error in case we
09:56:31.916 were not able to found that because we
09:56:34.560 cannot upsert this user. And now we can
09:56:37.800 finally go ahead and do stream video.
09:56:42.080 users. That's right. This agent will be
09:56:44.960 treated as a normal
09:56:47.960 user. So inside of here, let's add the
09:56:51.040 ID and the name to be existing agent ID
09:56:53.276 and existing agent name. Let's go ahead
09:56:56.000 and give it a role of user because we
09:56:59.596 already set the admin. And the image
09:57:02.000 will be our generate avatar URI with the
09:57:05.840 seed to be existing agent.name name and
09:57:08.880 the variant will be bots
09:57:11.320 neutral. Just like that. Perfect. And
09:57:14.640 now we can safely create our meeting.
09:57:16.880 And that's all we need to do with stream
09:57:19.276 video SDK uh in this procedure right
09:57:24.756 here. Now let's go ahead and let's
09:57:27.756 develop the following page which we get
09:57:30.880 access to in our upcoming state. If you
09:57:34.800 remember in the previous chapter, we
09:57:36.480 created a lot of meeting variants. One
09:57:38.720 of that was upcoming state which allows
09:57:41.436 the user to either cancel the meeting or
09:57:43.596 start the meeting. So it's basically
09:57:46.160 this screen right here. So when we start
09:57:48.560 the meeting, we are redirected to
09:57:50.680 forward/call meeting ID. Let's go ahead
09:57:53.436 and work on that page. Now the crucial
09:57:55.916 difference here will be that it's not
09:57:58.960 going to be inside of a dashboard. So,
09:58:02.080 it's going to be in its own folder call.
09:58:05.360 This means it's not going to have the
09:58:08.000 sidebar because we don't want it to be
09:58:10.560 anything other than full screen. So,
09:58:12.720 let's go inside of call and let's go
09:58:14.880 ahead and create a new folder meeting ID
09:58:18.800 and inside page esx. Why meeting ID?
09:58:24.160 That's because in our procedure right
09:58:26.640 now when we use the create method when
09:58:30.320 we create a new call we use the created
09:58:32.640 meeting ID as the unique identifier for
09:58:35.840 that call. So we can safely rely on the
09:58:38.160 meeting ID to help us find the call from
09:58:41.596 stream video SDK. Perfect. Now let's go
09:58:45.520 ahead and let's create a props here with
09:58:48.800 params promise and meeting ID. Be
09:58:50.960 mindful of spelling. Don't make any
09:58:52.800 typos or casing
09:58:54.840 errors. Let's export const page here.
09:58:58.000 Make it an asynchronous page and
09:59:00.000 destructure the params. Assign the props
09:59:03.800 here. And let's go ahead and dstructure
09:59:07.040 the meeting ID from the params like
09:59:11.800 this. Let's also make sure that this
09:59:14.640 page is protected. We can do that by
09:59:17.200 using our familiar session from
09:59:20.276 out which we can import from lib out get
09:59:23.436 session and pass in the headers from
09:59:26.080 next headers and the redirect from next
09:59:29.120 navigation if there is no session
09:59:30.720 available. So now only authenticated
09:59:33.200 users can visit this page. Now let's go
09:59:36.080 ahead and let's grab our query client
09:59:39.276 from get query client. We can get it
09:59:43.360 from TRPC server and let's void query
09:59:47.040 client prefetch query ERPC which you can
09:59:50.720 also import from the server here and
09:59:53.520 let's prefetch meetings get one pass in
09:59:57.360 the query options and use the ID as
10:00:00.480 meeting
10:00:03.640 ID just like that now let's go ahead and
10:00:07.436 return our hydration boundary here from
10:00:11.520 tan stack React query and add the state
10:00:14.720 as dehydrate from tanstack react query
10:00:17.596 and pass the query client
10:00:19.480 inside just like that. So we are doing
10:00:21.916 the prefetching like we've always done
10:00:24.080 it so far. So you can import dehydrate
10:00:27.120 and hydration boundary from tanstack
10:00:29.436 react query. And uh what I like to do is
10:00:34.080 for some reason I like to structure the
10:00:35.840 params up here. Even though we will
10:00:38.840 redirect it just feels right for it to
10:00:42.400 be here. Now what we have to do is we
10:00:44.800 have to develop the call view
10:00:48.680 component. We are going to develop that
10:00:51.120 inside of a new module. So let's go
10:00:52.880 inside of our modules and let's create a
10:00:54.720 new folder called call and inside of
10:00:57.520 here UI and then finally let's create
10:01:01.480 views and inside call- view
10:01:06.360 tsx it's going to have an interface
10:01:08.800 props of the meeting id and let's export
10:01:12.000 const call call view here and let's
10:01:14.560 simply grab those props here. So we are
10:01:16.960 basically extracting the meeting ID
10:01:19.436 here. So we can do
10:01:21.560 TRPC and so that we can extract the data
10:01:24.640 using use suspense
10:01:27.560 query from TRPC meetings get one with
10:01:32.480 the query options ID meeting ID. So now
10:01:37.120 we have that data prefetched here
10:01:39.680 because we are prefetching it here. So
10:01:41.916 we can now import call view and pass in
10:01:44.160 the meeting ID as meeting ID. Make sure
10:01:47.120 you have imported the call view from
10:01:48.960 modules call UI views call view. The
10:01:52.160 reason we still have an error here is
10:01:54.160 because we don't return any JSX here. So
10:01:58.000 let's go ahead and let's return a div
10:02:02.916 hello or maybe we can do JSON stringify
10:02:07.756 data null
10:02:09.640 2 just like that. and make sure to mark
10:02:12.240 the call view as use
10:02:15.800 client. Now let's go ahead and test our
10:02:18.480 app a bit just to see nothing's broken.
10:02:21.200 So make sure that you go instead of a
10:02:23.360 meeting which is in the state of
10:02:24.800 upcoming. If you are unsure, you can go
10:02:27.596 ahead and create a new meeting. I would
10:02:29.596 actually suggest that you go ahead and
10:02:31.360 create a new meeting so you can test the
10:02:34.000 video SDK. So let's click create here
10:02:37.360 and let's see if any errors pop up.
10:02:39.200 Maybe we did something
10:02:40.756 incorrectly in here. I cannot see any
10:02:43.840 errors at all, which would mean that we
10:02:45.680 have successfully uh upserted those
10:02:47.916 users and created those calls. And I
10:02:49.916 think that we might actually be able to
10:02:52.480 uh track this inside of here. Let me go
10:02:55.120 ahead and refresh here inside of my
10:02:57.680 video and audio. And I think that
10:03:00.080 somewhere here I might be able to go
10:03:03.040 maybe in the usage or
10:03:05.800 explorer. Let's click on calls here. And
10:03:08.800 there we go. I think that this is a new
10:03:11.520 call and I think uh it might not Yes, it
10:03:16.160 doesn't yet have any members. Uh I think
10:03:18.640 that in order to do that we actually
10:03:20.400 need to join the call I think. Right.
10:03:23.916 But this is the new call which we just
10:03:26.400 created. And you can see we have the
10:03:28.400 custom information test video SDK. So we
10:03:31.120 are successfully doing that. Perfect.
10:03:34.240 Now let's go ahead uh and let's click on
10:03:37.916 start meeting and in here we should now
10:03:41.276 see a redirect to forward slall and
10:03:43.756 looks like we are missing something. So
10:03:46.320 inside of this page here I'm doing
10:03:48.480 export const page but that's a mistake
10:03:51.916 because page needs to be export
10:03:54.916 default. So let's just fix that. And now
10:03:58.400 in here you can see no sidebar and we
10:04:01.276 have properly loaded the meeting ID for
10:04:04.080 which call we want to connect
10:04:06.840 to. Now let's go ahead and let's go
10:04:10.240 inside of our app folder call meeting ID
10:04:14.960 and inside of the entire call folder
10:04:17.596 create a layout.
10:04:20.276 DSX and it's going to be very simple. So
10:04:23.120 interface props with the children and
10:04:25.916 just wrap the children with a height
10:04:28.000 screen and background color of
10:04:30.840 black. So there we go. It's now just a
10:04:33.916 black on black text here. So I just
10:04:36.720 wanted to change the background for
10:04:38.720 everything relating the call to be
10:04:43.000 black. Now let's go back inside of our
10:04:45.596 call view here. And first things first,
10:04:48.000 let's check if data status is completed.
10:04:52.160 In that case, what I want to do here is
10:04:54.320 I want to return a div with a class name
10:04:56.880 flex hide screen items center and
10:05:00.480 justify center. And I want to render the
10:05:03.276 error
10:05:04.276 state from components error state. And
10:05:08.720 in here I just want to alert the user
10:05:11.756 that this meeting has ended and you can
10:05:14.720 no longer join this meeting.
10:05:17.756 So now we can test this out more easily
10:05:20.800 by changing this to
10:05:22.360 upcoming. So there we go. This is the
10:05:24.640 error that the user will see, but only
10:05:26.720 when it's
10:05:27.960 completed. So make sure you change this
10:05:30.080 to completed. So the upcoming user
10:05:31.916 actually sees the JSON stringify for
10:05:36.360 now. Now let's go ahead inside of call
10:05:40.360 UI and let's create a new folder called
10:05:43.480 components. Inside of here, create a
10:05:46.400 call
10:05:48.040 dashprovider
10:05:49.640 component. Now, inside of here, go ahead
10:05:52.080 and mark it as use
10:05:54.436 client. And go ahead and
10:05:56.916 import loader to icon from Lucid Ref.
10:06:01.680 Import AL client from lib al client.
10:06:05.680 Import generate avatar URI from lib
10:06:08.320 avatar. And let's quickly create an
10:06:12.080 interface props with meeting ID and the
10:06:14.800 meeting name. And now let's export const
10:06:18.640 call provider
10:06:20.436 here. Let's assign the props and let's
10:06:23.840 dstructure the meeting ID and the
10:06:26.080 meeting name. Let me just fix the
10:06:28.080 capitalization
10:06:30.120 issue. And inside of here, let's go
10:06:32.960 ahead and let's get our current session
10:06:36.400 using al client use session. So now we
10:06:38.960 have data and is pending here. So in
10:06:41.596 case we don't have data or in case is
10:06:44.320 pending is active, we are going to
10:06:46.960 return a div with a loader to icon
10:06:50.360 inside. Give the div a class name of
10:06:53.400 flex height screen items center justify
10:06:58.320 center background
10:07:00.756 radial from sidebar accent to sidebar. I
10:07:05.520 told you we're going to reuse that
10:07:07.756 variables a few more times in the
10:07:09.436 project and give the icon size six
10:07:11.916 animate spin and text
10:07:16.360 white. And now down here, go ahead and
10:07:20.800 simply return meeting ID inside of a
10:07:24.640 div.
10:07:28.276 Whoops. And meeting
10:07:31.960 name. Just like this.
10:07:35.680 And now let's go inside of the call view
10:07:37.880 here and let's
10:07:40.840 return call
10:07:43.240 provider from components call provider
10:07:47.120 and pass in the meeting ID to be meeting
10:07:50.080 ID and meeting name to be data
10:07:55.640 name. So now when you refresh this, you
10:07:58.640 should now see a loading and then in
10:08:01.120 here you will see the name and the ID.
10:08:03.916 It's just uh black text
10:08:06.680 here. Now what I want to do is I just
10:08:09.756 want to change the call provider from
10:08:12.080 loader to icon to just the normal loader
10:08:15.916 icon because I don't think we use loader
10:08:18.240 to throughout the project as much. So
10:08:19.840 let me refresh here. Let's do refresh
10:08:22.880 again. Yeah, that's the uh loader that I
10:08:26.960 want. Now, we're going to go ahead and
10:08:29.276 we're going to build a new component
10:08:31.120 which we are going to render here and
10:08:32.880 where we are going to pass this to as
10:08:35.200 well and it's going to be inside of the
10:08:36.880 same components folder. So, create
10:08:41.960 call-connect.tsx and create an interface
10:08:44.160 props accepting the meeting ID, meeting
10:08:46.560 name and the new user data information
10:08:49.840 which we await for here. So user ID,
10:08:53.040 username and user image. Let's export
10:08:56.400 con call connect
10:08:58.840 here and let's go ahead and assign the
10:09:01.596 props here and let's dstructure all of
10:09:05.596 them. There we go. Now inside of here uh
10:09:09.756 I want to go ahead and return a div call
10:09:13.960 connect like this. So let's go to the
10:09:17.436 call provider here and instead of
10:09:19.756 returning this let's return call connect
10:09:22.720 component which is a self-closing tag.
10:09:25.200 Make sure you have imported it and we
10:09:28.240 are now going to pass the meeting ID and
10:09:32.720 the meeting name the user ID and the
10:09:36.400 username which we get from data which we
10:09:39.596 use here in the use session. And finally
10:09:43.520 we are going to get the user image which
10:09:46.560 will look for data user image if it
10:09:48.640 exists otherwise it will generate one
10:09:51.040 using our generate avatar using seed
10:09:53.840 data username and variant initials.
10:09:57.520 Great. So now we can go inside of the
10:09:59.840 call connect and we can continue
10:10:01.916 developing here.
10:10:04.720 So now we should actually go ahead and
10:10:07.680 go back inside of the stream
10:10:09.040 documentation but this time go inside of
10:10:11.276 react documentation here and we have to
10:10:14.800 go ahead and install uh stream io video
10:10:19.596 react SDK. So let me go ahead and copy
10:10:22.080 this. Let me expand this a little
10:10:25.480 bit. Clear and let me add d- legacy here
10:10:30.480 depths like this.
10:10:33.276 Great. Once this is installed, let me
10:10:36.480 immediately show you my package JSON so
10:10:39.756 you can see the version. The version is
10:10:42.640 just in case you can't get your uh your
10:10:46.240 doesn't work. So you you think it's the
10:10:48.400 version. Well, this is the version I'm
10:10:50.000 using. So you can always install this
10:10:51.680 directly and then try with that version.
10:10:54.480 Now let's focus on the call connect
10:10:57.200 component. So in here we're going to
10:10:59.916 import the following items from stream
10:11:04.480 io video react SDK calling state stream
10:11:08.160 call stream video and stream video
10:11:11.000 client. We are also going to add import
10:11:15.200 loader icon from lucid react. We are
10:11:18.640 going to import use effect from react
10:11:20.880 and use
10:11:22.360 state from react.
10:11:25.596 And we're also going to add use DRPC
10:11:29.680 from TRPC
10:11:31.400 client. And we are also going to need to
10:11:35.120 import the last import needs to be
10:11:38.640 stream io video react SDK
10:11:42.436 dists
10:11:44.200 style.css. So that's how you style the
10:11:46.640 components of stream. And we are later
10:11:49.276 going to modify some of the variables to
10:11:51.520 match our theme, our project theme.
10:11:55.436 uh and also let's import use
10:11:58.596 mutation from tanstack react query and
10:12:02.640 mark this as use
10:12:04.436 client. Now let's go ahead and use all
10:12:07.276 of these props to establish our call. So
10:12:11.520 let's add TRPC from use DRPC here and
10:12:15.276 let's extract mutate async and let's map
10:12:18.560 it to
10:12:19.640 generate token use mutation and pass in
10:12:24.480 TRPC meetings generate token with
10:12:28.080 mutation options
10:12:30.200 here. Now open up the use state with the
10:12:34.160 first argument client, second one set
10:12:36.880 client and use state and give it a type
10:12:41.040 of stream video
10:12:44.200 client. Now open up the use effect
10:12:48.916 here. Set the empty dependency array for
10:12:51.916 now and let's do the following. Create
10:12:55.040 the underscore client variable simply
10:12:57.680 because client is already taken using
10:13:00.160 new stream video
10:13:03.320 client inside of API
10:13:06.276 key. Go ahead and add our process
10:13:10.120 environment next public stream video API
10:13:13.320 key. Please be mindful and go inside of
10:13:16.080 your environment and just copy it from
10:13:18.480 here. Make sure it has the next public
10:13:20.240 prefix so it's accessible on the client.
10:13:22.240 Copy it from here and paste it here. And
10:13:25.436 now let's add the user. So ID is user
10:13:28.400 ID, name is username and image is user
10:13:32.560 image. And we have made it convenient
10:13:35.360 for us. So all of these are just props.
10:13:38.560 Great. And let's add the token provider
10:13:40.640 for the user training to join which will
10:13:42.720 be this mutate asynchronous function. So
10:13:45.756 let's just pass it here. And you will
10:13:47.520 see it's completely compatible. Perfect.
10:13:51.120 And then let's go ahead and do set
10:13:53.680 client to this newly created client like
10:13:57.276 that. And in the unmount method, we have
10:14:00.480 to call this established
10:14:03.000 underscoreclient and disconnect the user
10:14:05.596 and set the client back to
10:14:09.800 undefined. And now let's go ahead and
10:14:12.000 let's add all the dependency array
10:14:15.040 items.
10:14:16.800 user ID, username, user image, and
10:14:19.840 generate token. So now we will have
10:14:22.240 access to that generated client inside
10:14:24.880 of this state and we will be able to
10:14:26.640 pass it around and do whatever we want
10:14:28.400 with
10:14:29.960 it. Now that we have established our
10:14:33.200 stream video client, we have to
10:14:35.360 establish the actual call. So we're
10:14:37.596 going to do a pretty similar thing
10:14:39.436 starting with the use state call and set
10:14:41.840 call with the type of call which we
10:14:43.916 imported from stream io video react
10:14:47.240 SDK and then let's go ahead and let's
10:14:50.320 open a new use effect which will check
10:14:53.880 if we don't have the client. So if we
10:14:58.000 don't have a client set we cannot
10:15:00.000 initialize the call at all. So simply
10:15:02.240 return at this point and then we're
10:15:04.800 going to create underscore call using
10:15:07.400 client call. The type of call will be
10:15:10.640 default and meeting ID will be the
10:15:13.880 identifier. Let's go ahead and by
10:15:16.436 default disable the camera for this user
10:15:20.480 and by default disable the microphone
10:15:23.916 for this
10:15:26.120 user. And let's set call underscore
10:15:29.640 call. And now in the unmount function we
10:15:32.880 have to disconnect from the call but
10:15:35.276 only under certain conditions. If
10:15:37.520 underscore call state calling state is
10:15:41.756 not identical to calling
10:15:46.680 state. Then you can do underscore call
10:15:50.520 leave and underscore call and call and
10:15:55.200 set call to
10:15:57.160 undefined like this. And inside of the
10:15:59.680 dependency array, add the client and
10:16:02.240 meeting ID like that. And now let's go
10:16:06.560 ahead and let's check if at this point
10:16:09.360 we still uh don't have client or we
10:16:13.596 still don't have a call. We're just
10:16:16.160 going to do the same thing we did in the
10:16:17.756 call provider and return this type of
10:16:21.680 loader here. So let me just indent uh my
10:16:24.880 items here a bit. There we go.
10:16:28.800 Perfect. So this this will be the loader
10:16:33.276 while all of these is being set up here
10:16:36.240 the call and the client. And now finally
10:16:38.560 in the return instead of a div we can
10:16:40.640 render stream video with client being
10:16:45.320 client inside of here stream
10:16:50.596 call with call being call. And now
10:16:56.000 inside of here, let's just see what we
10:16:58.240 have left unused. Meeting name. Okay. So
10:17:01.360 what we have to add now is the call
10:17:04.756 UI
10:17:06.276 element. Let's go ahead and go inside of
10:17:08.640 components and let's create call UI
10:17:12.680 tsx. Inside of call UI, let's create the
10:17:16.400 props which are meeting ID and the
10:17:19.360 meeting name. Actually, we don't need
10:17:22.320 meeting ID, just the name. Let's export
10:17:24.960 const call call
10:17:27.400 UI. Let's assign the props, the
10:17:30.720 structure, the meeting
10:17:33.480 name. And inside of here, we're going to
10:17:37.200 go ahead and do the following. The first
10:17:39.120 thing we can actually do is since the
10:17:41.436 call UI is rendered inside of these two,
10:17:44.960 we can use hooks to get the current
10:17:47.916 state of the call. So let's go ahead and
10:17:51.436 let's import the
10:17:54.360 following. Let's import stream and use
10:17:58.080 call from stream io video react
10:18:01.320 SDK. And let's also import the following
10:18:04.720 use state from react like this. Now
10:18:08.800 let's go ahead and let's obtain the call
10:18:11.360 from use call and let's create the
10:18:14.720 following use
10:18:16.360 state show and set show and the types
10:18:20.400 can be lobby call or ended with the
10:18:24.320 default being lobby and now let's create
10:18:28.160 two methods one is handle join which is
10:18:31.756 going to be an asynchronous method if
10:18:34.320 there is no call we are going to break
10:18:36.080 this method and let's just do a way call
10:18:38.960 and join the call. And after that, we
10:18:41.276 can set show to an active
10:18:43.880 call. And let's do handle
10:18:46.916 leave to check if there's no call and
10:18:49.680 break the method as well. And do call
10:18:51.756 end call and set show to ended. So we
10:18:56.400 now have methods to start the call from
10:18:58.560 the lobby and to leave the call from the
10:19:01.040 actual well call. Let's go ahead and
10:19:04.720 return stream theme with a class name of
10:19:08.960 height pool. And now if show is equal to
10:19:13.800 lobby, we should go ahead and render
10:19:16.840 lobby. If show is equal to call, we
10:19:20.560 should render the call. And if it is
10:19:23.640 ended, we should render
10:19:26.756 ended. So let's go ahead now and let's
10:19:29.840 use call UI inside of the call connect.
10:19:32.480 So, let's add it here. And meeting name
10:19:35.680 is meeting name like
10:19:39.640 this. So, I'm going to go back to my app
10:19:43.120 here and I'm going to do a refresh and
10:19:46.320 let's just see what will happen. You can
10:19:48.560 see I am in the lobby. It's very hard to
10:19:50.880 see. You have to highlight it, right? Uh
10:19:53.756 because we set our background to be
10:19:56.160 black. But you can see the text is now
10:19:59.840 the text now says lobby because I'm in
10:20:01.916 the lobby by default. So now let's go
10:20:04.400 ahead and let's create the lobby
10:20:07.120 component. Inside of components add call
10:20:12.596 lobby.tsx. And in here we're going to go
10:20:15.276 ahead and do the following props on
10:20:19.480 join. And let's go ahead and prepare the
10:20:22.240 following imports here. So that's going
10:20:25.200 to be login icon from lucid react and
10:20:28.160 we're going to have a bunch of imports
10:20:30.000 from stream io video react SDK dream
10:20:34.000 default video placeholder stream video
10:20:36.400 participant toggle audio preview button
10:20:39.200 toggle video preview button use call
10:20:41.680 state hooks and video preview. We are
10:20:44.000 basically now building this page right
10:20:46.080 here, the lobby, asking the user if they
10:20:48.320 are ready to join and giving them an
10:20:50.240 option to set up their video camera and
10:20:54.596 microphone. Let's also go ahead and
10:20:56.880 import link from next link. Let's go
10:21:00.960 ahead and
10:21:02.596 import al client from lib al client
10:21:06.240 button from components UI button and
10:21:08.480 generate avatar URI from our newly
10:21:10.720 created lib. And let's also import the
10:21:14.560 styles here as well. So stream io video
10:21:18.560 react sdk this css styles CSS like that.
10:21:23.840 Now let's go ahead and let's export
10:21:26.320 const call
10:21:28.360 lobby in here. Let's destructure on
10:21:31.960 join props.
10:21:34.640 And now we can go ahead and we can
10:21:38.120 grab camera state and microphone state
10:21:41.200 from use call state
10:21:43.560 hooks. From these two hooks, we can d
10:21:47.680 the structure has browser permission for
10:21:50.240 both of them. But since they are named
10:21:52.160 the same, we will alias this one to has
10:21:54.880 microphone permission and this one to
10:21:56.960 has camera permission. And we're going
10:21:59.360 to unify that into a single variable has
10:22:01.916 browser media permission. So if we
10:22:03.680 don't, we can then display to the user
10:22:05.680 that they need to allow the browser to
10:22:08.080 access the camera and the microphone. So
10:22:10.800 now let's go ahead and return a div here
10:22:13.680 with a class name flex flex column items
10:22:17.756 center justify center height full
10:22:21.680 background radial from sidebar accent to
10:22:26.240 sidebar. Inside, open up a new div with
10:22:29.756 a class name py of 4, px of 8, flex,
10:22:34.880 flex one, items center, and
10:22:39.560 justify
10:22:41.400 center. Inside of that div, let's open
10:22:44.720 one more div with a class name of flex.
10:22:48.240 Lex column items center justify
10:22:53.720 center gap Y 6 BG background rounded
10:22:59.436 large padding of 10 and shadow
10:23:03.080 small. Inside of
10:23:05.560 here we are going to add one more div. I
10:23:08.960 know this is divception. So many divs.
10:23:11.436 Uh but we will finally write some text
10:23:13.360 inside of this one. I promise. So flex
10:23:15.840 flex column
10:23:17.800 gap Y2 and text center. Let's add an H6
10:23:22.720 element ready to join. And let's add a
10:23:28.596 paragraph. Set up your call before
10:23:32.200 joining. Now let's go ahead and give the
10:23:34.720 heading a class name of text large and
10:23:37.276 font medium and the paragraph a class
10:23:40.480 name of text small.
10:23:43.596 Now let's go ahead and go back instead
10:23:45.840 of call UI and let's actually render
10:23:48.720 call lobby here and the only thing it
10:23:52.320 accepts is the onjoin method. So let's
10:23:55.596 pass in on join to be handle join. So
10:24:00.640 there we go. This is what you will see
10:24:03.040 now. Let's
10:24:04.756 refresh. Ready to join. Set up your call
10:24:07.916 before joining. And now instead of call
10:24:10.880 lobby, we actually have to go ahead and
10:24:14.080 render the video preview. So in order to
10:24:18.480 render the video preview, uh we have to
10:24:21.596 create the following a const disabled
10:24:25.596 video
10:24:27.160 preview. And in here the structure the
10:24:31.916 data from out client use
10:24:35.400 session and return default video
10:24:39.040 placeholder which is a self-closing tag
10:24:41.840 and inside add the participant prop.
10:24:45.360 Open a new object inside set the name to
10:24:48.720 data question mark user name or an empty
10:24:52.276 string. image will
10:24:55.960 be
10:24:57.480 data question mark user
10:25:00.596 image or generate avatar URI with seed
10:25:06.160 data question mark user name or an empty
10:25:10.080 string and let's just open an object
10:25:13.240 here like this and we also need to pass
10:25:17.200 the variant here to be initials like
10:25:20.596 this and in order to get rid of the
10:25:23.120 error use as stream video participant
10:25:26.960 prop
10:25:27.880 here like this. So now we have the
10:25:31.120 disabled video preview here and we need
10:25:34.160 uh just one more thing one more
10:25:36.000 component besides disabled video preview
10:25:38.320 and it's very simple one allow browser
10:25:40.880 permissions just a simple paragraph
10:25:44.000 please grant your browser a permission
10:25:45.916 to access your camera and microphone.
10:25:49.276 And now outside of this div add a video
10:25:52.960 preview
10:25:54.680 component and pass in disabled video
10:25:57.916 preview to be the following. If has
10:26:00.560 browser media
10:26:02.756 permission you will
10:26:04.756 use disabled video preview otherwise
10:26:08.560 allow browser permissions like this. And
10:26:13.120 there we go. Since by default my uh
10:26:18.000 camera is disabled, you can only see my
10:26:21.040 current user's image which is Google
10:26:23.596 login. So Google image is loaded here.
10:26:26.400 Perfect. So it's correctly loads the
10:26:28.480 currently logged in user here. Now below
10:26:31.756 the video preview, let's add a div with
10:26:34.560 a class name of flex gap x2. And inside
10:26:38.960 of here, we are going to render toggle
10:26:42.640 audio preview button and toggle video
10:26:45.436 preview button. There we go. And now
10:26:48.720 let's go ahead below here. Open up a div
10:26:51.680 with a class name
10:26:54.200 flex gap x of justify between and full
10:26:59.520 width. In here, let's add first button
10:27:03.680 to be cancel and the second button to be
10:27:08.480 join call with login
10:27:12.360 icon. This one will also be a
10:27:16.436 link with an href going back to meetings
10:27:20.080 and give this an as child prop and a
10:27:22.320 variant of ghost. the one below will
10:27:26.240 simply have on click to be on join. And
10:27:30.800 just like that, we've wrapped up our
10:27:33.120 call lobby method. So, we can now cancel
10:27:36.240 and go back to the meetings or we can go
10:27:39.276 to uh make sure you choose the newer
10:27:41.680 one, right? So, delete any old ones you
10:27:44.000 had because uh there's a chance it might
10:27:46.800 not work because we only in this chapter
10:27:49.040 added the call creation in the create
10:27:51.276 procedure. So, use the newest one and
10:27:54.560 click start meeting. And there we go.
10:27:56.880 And when you click join call, uh I don't
10:28:00.000 do it just yet because uh I'm not sure
10:28:02.960 what's going to happen, but what will
10:28:05.596 happen is you will just see a paragraph
10:28:07.680 call which will actually be invisible.
10:28:09.916 Right? So now let's actually develop the
10:28:14.000 uh call
10:28:15.480 active for this. So inside of components
10:28:19.596 create
10:28:23.480 call-active.tsx. Let's create the
10:28:25.436 interface with on leave and the meeting
10:28:28.040 name. And let's import the following
10:28:31.120 things. Link from next link image from
10:28:34.000 next image call controls and speaker
10:28:36.560 layout from stream io video react SDK.
10:28:40.560 export const call
10:28:42.916 active get on leave and meeting name
10:28:48.000 assign it to props
10:28:50.040 here and let's go ahead and return a div
10:28:54.320 with a class name flex flex column
10:28:58.040 justify between padding for height full
10:29:02.640 and text white and inside open up a new
10:29:05.840 div with a class name of background and
10:29:10.000 You can use the following hex
10:29:12.436 code and a rounded pool adding four flex
10:29:17.880 items center and gap four like that.
10:29:22.800 Inside add a link
10:29:26.596 element like this with an href of
10:29:30.640 forward slash and give it a class name
10:29:32.880 of plex items center justify center
10:29:36.720 padding one background white forward
10:29:39.596 slash 10 rounded full and w fit and
10:29:44.640 render an image with a source of
10:29:49.320 our app logo with
10:29:53.320 width 22 and height 22 and alt
10:29:58.040 logo and then after that an H4 element
10:30:02.560 with our meeting name and a class name
10:30:06.720 of text
10:30:08.360 base and outside of that div speaker
10:30:11.756 layout which is a self-closing tag and
10:30:13.756 below that a div with call
10:30:16.436 controls. Go ahead and give it a
10:30:19.040 background the same as above. So class
10:30:21.596 name
10:30:22.360 here and rounded full and px of
10:30:27.480 four and let's pass our on leave method
10:30:30.960 to call controls on leave and let's add
10:30:34.560 our on leave here. There we go. So now
10:30:38.400 we can go back to the uh call UI and in
10:30:42.960 here render call active just like we
10:30:46.560 rendered uh call lobby and let's pass on
10:30:49.916 leave to be handle
10:30:53.160 leave and we also need the meeting name
10:30:56.960 and I think we have that we do meeting
10:30:59.560 name let's go ahead and try it out now
10:31:02.160 so when I click join call there we go
10:31:06.320 and I can go ahead and send emojis here.
10:31:09.680 I can uh open my camera again. Here I
10:31:12.400 am. Uh and you can see that I have the
10:31:15.680 meeting name rendered right here. And
10:31:17.596 you can see the meeting is actively
10:31:19.200 being recorded. I can also share my
10:31:21.120 screen. You can see my connection here.
10:31:23.360 And I can also end the call. But before
10:31:26.480 we end the call, let's actually
10:31:29.120 implement the end screen so we can wrap
10:31:31.040 up this chapter.
10:31:33.436 So what we can actually do is we can
10:31:35.200 copy call lobby and paste it and rename
10:31:37.756 it to call ended. Go inside of call
10:31:41.120 ended here. You can remove all props.
10:31:43.680 You can remove this component. You can
10:31:45.840 remove allow browser permissions. Rename
10:31:48.000 call lobby to call ended. Remove any
10:31:50.640 props from here. Uh you can remove this.
10:31:53.276 You can remove this. Basically remove
10:31:55.596 everything besides link and
10:31:58.436 button. So just a return method here.
10:32:01.596 And inside of this heading six uh
10:32:04.000 heading six you will use you have ended
10:32:07.680 the call. And in the
10:32:10.680 summary in the in here you will add
10:32:13.596 summary will appear in a few minutes.
10:32:16.640 And then outside of this div there will
10:32:18.400 be no video preview none of this. Right?
10:32:21.596 So let's go ahead and remove this. Let's
10:32:24.560 remove
10:32:25.800 this and let's remove this as well. So
10:32:29.360 all you're going to do after
10:32:31.400 this is back to meetings button because
10:32:35.200 there will be no action to do here. So
10:32:37.040 now we can go back to call UI and we can
10:32:39.916 render call ended here just like that.
10:32:44.800 So now that we have all of these states
10:32:46.800 when I actually end the call this
10:32:49.436 appears you have ended the call. So we
10:32:53.200 have officially implemented the video
10:32:55.756 calling. The problem is states are not
10:32:58.960 being changed. So I can now start this
10:33:01.680 meeting as many times as I want and join
10:33:04.320 it and end it. Right? But we have two
10:33:06.640 problems. Agent is not joining and uh no
10:33:10.640 actual background jobs are being done
10:33:12.800 and there is no communicating with our
10:33:14.640 database. So that's what we're going to
10:33:16.080 do in the next chapter to properly
10:33:18.080 synchronize those states. But we did
10:33:20.400 such an amazing job. We obtained stream
10:33:23.040 API keys, stream video SDK. We've
10:33:25.596 created these procedures. We added call
10:33:27.756 page and call view. And now let's merge
10:33:31.960 this. Let's go and create a new branch
10:33:35.040 here. 22 video
10:33:38.120 call. Let's go ahead and stage all of
10:33:41.756 our
10:33:42.680 changes. Just like that. 22 video call.
10:33:46.960 Let's commit. Let's publish our branch.
10:33:50.640 And let's review our pull request to see
10:33:54.480 if there are any potential issues with
10:33:57.276 our
10:33:58.756 code. And here we have this chapter's
10:34:01.756 summary. We introduced video call
10:34:03.840 functionality including joining,
10:34:05.756 participating in, and ending calls with
10:34:08.000 a streamlined user interface. This
10:34:10.320 includes a pre-join lobby, in call
10:34:12.640 controls, and a post call summary
10:34:14.720 screens for a complete meeting
10:34:16.320 experience. We integrated video call
10:34:18.800 service for secure token generation and
10:34:21.040 user management. We automatically
10:34:23.360 created and managed video calls when
10:34:25.360 scheduling meetings and we display user
10:34:27.596 avatars and meeting details throughout
10:34:29.596 the entire call experience. As always,
10:34:33.120 in here we have a sequence diagram
10:34:35.596 containing every single component that
10:34:38.720 we just created in this request. This is
10:34:41.596 absolutely insanely detailed. Uh, in
10:34:44.800 case you're interested, I'm just going
10:34:46.400 to try and target it, center it like
10:34:49.680 this, so you can take a look and review
10:34:52.240 this entire diagram explaining exactly
10:34:54.640 what's going on in our code. As per the
10:34:57.596 code changes, most of these are refactor
10:35:00.000 suggestions which we have already seen,
10:35:01.840 but we decided that we like our current
10:35:04.000 practice. But there are a couple of
10:35:06.160 potential issues that I want to discuss.
10:35:08.240 So this one is because it doesn't know
10:35:10.480 yet that headers are now awaitable. they
10:35:13.040 are a promise. Same with the params. So
10:35:15.680 we are okay with this. This is not an
10:35:17.520 issue. Uh this is a refactor suggestion.
10:35:21.040 And in here it shows some u JVT payload
10:35:26.160 fields are incorrect. Token may be
10:35:27.960 invalid. As you can see in here it uh
10:35:31.436 tells me that my tokens might be
10:35:33.200 invalidly created. uh and I'm not
10:35:37.276 entirely sure but what I can tell you is
10:35:40.640 that I went into video and audio
10:35:42.960 platform here user tokens and I uh
10:35:46.320 learned that validity and basically
10:35:49.040 everything besides user ID is completely
10:35:51.840 optional. So yeah, technically in our
10:35:54.560 procedures in the meetings when we
10:35:57.276 generate the
10:36:00.120 token, we don't even have to use these
10:36:04.160 two. We can just pass. You can see there
10:36:07.520 there are no errors here. So if you want
10:36:09.436 to if it's causing you any problems, if
10:36:11.756 it's expiring too soon, you can delete
10:36:14.080 these two fields and this generation and
10:36:16.240 just use the user ID. So that's the new
10:36:18.320 thing I've learned here thanks to uh
10:36:20.880 rabbit's potential issue. Uh with the
10:36:23.596 rest I am satisfied. So I'm going to go
10:36:25.680 ahead here and merge this pull request.
10:36:29.520 And that marks the end of this chapter.
10:36:31.680 Let's go back to the main branch. And
10:36:34.160 let's go ahead and synchronize our
10:36:36.360 changes. Let's go inside of the source
10:36:39.436 control. Open up the graph and confirm.
10:36:42.000 We just merged the video call. And we
10:36:45.276 did. Great. Amazing job and see you in
10:36:48.000 the next
10:36:49.560 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
10:36:52.160 learn how to connect the agent to our
10:36:54.560 video call. Let's start by obtaining the
10:36:57.840 OpenAI API key, which you can do by
10:37:00.960 visiting
10:37:03.800 platform.openai.com, or you can use the
10:37:05.680 link in the description to let them know
10:37:07.360 you came from this video. After that, go
10:37:10.400 ahead and log in or create an account.
10:37:13.040 If it's your first account, you will
10:37:14.800 most likely have to create an
10:37:16.436 organization. And as per project, you
10:37:18.720 can use the default project. Now, go
10:37:21.360 inside of your
10:37:23.160 settings. Once you are in your settings,
10:37:25.680 go inside of billing and confirm you
10:37:27.840 have sufficient credit balance. Five or
10:37:30.640 $6 will be more than enough for you to
10:37:32.800 complete this project. And after that,
10:37:35.040 go inside of API keys and click create
10:37:37.360 new secret key. I'm going to call this
10:37:40.000 meet AI. Select the default project with
10:37:42.480 all
10:37:43.400 permissions. Let's go ahead and copy our
10:37:45.840 key inside of your IDE. Make sure you
10:37:48.640 are in the default project. Go inside of
10:37:51.200 environment here and set open AAI API
10:37:54.400 key to be your newly copied key. The
10:37:58.240 next step we have to do is set up enrock
10:38:01.200 to expose our local host so webco
10:38:03.680 handlers can communicate to it. So head
10:38:06.880 to angrock.com and create an account or
10:38:10.320 you can simply use the link in the
10:38:11.756 description to let them know you came
10:38:13.360 from this video. Once you create an
10:38:15.436 account, you will see a welcome screen
10:38:17.200 like this. In here, select your
10:38:19.680 operating system and simply follow the
10:38:22.560 installation
10:38:23.800 method. And once you've added your
10:38:26.000 token, go ahead and try running this
10:38:29.120 command right here. In order to properly
10:38:32.080 test it, first make sure you have your
10:38:34.080 app running on localhost 3000 and after
10:38:36.880 that change the command to target well
10:38:39.436 localhost 3000. This will generate the
10:38:42.640 following forwarding URL using HTTPS
10:38:46.840 protocol. So now when you paste that
10:38:49.520 inside of your URL, you will be able to
10:38:52.080 see your project's login screen, meaning
10:38:55.120 that our project is now accessible
10:38:57.596 through this URL right here.
10:39:00.480 The only problem with this is every time
10:39:03.200 that you run this
10:39:05.240 command, a new URL will be generated and
10:39:08.800 that's quite difficult to work with. So
10:39:11.520 what Enro offers is a static domain. If
10:39:15.120 you can't find it here, you can click
10:39:16.720 inside of domains here and then find it
10:39:18.880 down
10:39:19.800 here. And then you can find start a
10:39:22.480 tunnel button and you can copy this
10:39:25.400 command. So
10:39:27.320 now you can go ahead and run the
10:39:30.120 following which basically adds your
10:39:33.120 static URL here and change the port to
10:39:36.120 3000. So what happens now is every time
10:39:38.800 you run this command you will have your
10:39:41.680 own static URL. There we go. Our app is
10:39:45.120 accessible through that URL. Keep in
10:39:47.680 mind that it's not intended to access
10:39:50.160 our app through that URL. You shouldn't
10:39:52.320 use that to share your app with someone
10:39:54.240 else. we will have a deployment for that
10:39:56.800 because this will cause many things to
10:39:58.640 fail. The only thing we need this for is
10:40:02.160 web hooks. So what I want to do now is I
10:40:05.360 want to go inside of my package JSON
10:40:07.400 here and I want to add dev web hook
10:40:11.400 command and I simply want to run
10:40:15.800 this. This is the command I want to
10:40:18.916 run enro http and then your static URL.
10:40:23.840 So now every time you're starting your
10:40:26.040 project in one terminal simply type mpm
10:40:29.436 rundev and in another mpm rundev web web
10:40:32.756 hook. As simple as
10:40:35.240 that. So now that we have that let's go
10:40:38.560 ahead and let's set up stream web hook
10:40:41.200 handler. So, the first thing you're
10:40:43.360 going to have to do is just copy your
10:40:45.120 URL, your uh static domain URL, and go
10:40:49.916 inside of stream dashboard, specifically
10:40:52.880 video and audio, and click on
10:40:55.240 overview. In here, go ahead and scroll
10:40:57.916 down until you find web hook URL, and
10:41:00.880 paste it here. Make sure it includes the
10:41:03.276 proper protocol
10:41:04.916 HTTPS. So, you can visit that here,
10:41:07.840 right
10:41:08.680 here. and change this to be forward
10:41:11.360 slash API slash web hook. Make sure to
10:41:15.436 not misspell it. And for the events you
10:41:18.240 want to listen to, uh we won't be
10:41:20.720 needing all of these, but feel free to
10:41:22.800 leave all of them selected so it's
10:41:24.640 easier to develop right now. Just make
10:41:26.800 sure you have all of them selected
10:41:28.320 regarding call. And after that, make
10:41:31.200 sure you click submit. Perfect. So now
10:41:35.040 let's go ahead and let's actually build
10:41:37.436 the endpoint. So we are going to do it
10:41:39.840 in the place we just added API web hook.
10:41:42.560 So inside of source app folder API
10:41:45.360 create a new folder called web hook and
10:41:48.080 inside of here
10:41:50.120 route.ds. Inside of this route let's
10:41:52.560 prepare by adding the following imports
10:41:54.960 from stream io node SDK. We are going to
10:41:58.320 use all of them uh except message new
10:42:00.880 event for now. So these are the events
10:42:03.040 we are interested in for this chapter.
10:42:05.680 Now let's go ahead and let's also add
10:42:08.400 the following from drizzle and equals
10:42:12.480 and not and let's also import next
10:42:16.640 request and next response from next
10:42:19.000 server. Then we are going to import our
10:42:22.596 database. We are going to import agents
10:42:25.120 and meetings from database schema. And
10:42:27.596 we are going to import stream video from
10:42:29.840 lib stream video. What we have to do now
10:42:33.360 is develop a method to verify the
10:42:35.596 signature for whoever is trying to
10:42:37.840 access this web hook because this will
10:42:39.680 not be protected via our AL. Instead, it
10:42:42.800 will be protected via a signature. So we
10:42:46.320 adding a function called verify
10:42:48.400 signature with SDK which accepts the
10:42:50.560 body and the signature and calls stream
10:42:53.200 video util verify web hook using the
10:42:56.000 body and the signature. Now let's export
10:42:59.040 asynchronous function post with request
10:43:02.480 next request
10:43:03.880 here. And what we have to do now is we
10:43:06.480 have to obtain two
10:43:08.680 headers signature and API key from
10:43:11.680 request headers get and then their
10:43:14.080 respective header names. If you want to,
10:43:17.360 you can also use the next headers
10:43:21.640 import just in case you're using some
10:43:24.080 newer version and this becomes outdated
10:43:26.640 even though it shouldn't because this is
10:43:28.560 the native Node.js API. So if you want
10:43:31.756 to this will also work. You can also
10:43:33.756 await headers and then do headers.get
10:43:36.240 the same way just in case you were
10:43:38.520 interested. Now let's go ahead and check
10:43:41.120 if any of these are missing and if they
10:43:43.200 are throw an error. Now in order to
10:43:46.960 verify our signature we have to turn the
10:43:49.756 body of this request into a string. We
10:43:52.400 can do that by using await
10:43:54.756 request.ext and then we can do a final
10:43:57.880 check. If verify signature with SDK
10:44:01.360 including our body and the signature
10:44:03.680 failed meaning put an exclamation point
10:44:05.916 here we throw back an error meaning you
10:44:08.720 don't have access for this endpoint. Now
10:44:12.400 let's define our payload to be unknown
10:44:14.800 and let's attempt to uh parse the string
10:44:18.800 which we just created here. So we are
10:44:21.200 attempting to parse it and if we fail to
10:44:24.000 parse it, it means it's not a valid
10:44:26.160 JSON. So we can't work with it. And then
10:44:30.080 after we successfully parse it, let's
10:44:32.240 prepare a constant event type. We have
10:44:35.040 to assign the payload to be a type of
10:44:36.960 object and then simply extract type from
10:44:39.916 it. And now we can finally check if
10:44:42.800 event type is one of our events that we
10:44:46.276 need. The first one will be call session
10:44:50.360 started. But before you do any
10:44:52.560 development in here, what I want you to
10:44:54.880 do is I want you to go outside of this
10:44:56.880 if clause and simply return a success
10:44:59.040 message at the end. because otherwise
10:45:01.360 all other events which did were not
10:45:03.756 handled would be throwing an error and
10:45:06.000 that would eventually cause stream to
10:45:08.000 stop sending our web hook any events. So
10:45:11.596 make sure to add that. Great. Now let's
10:45:15.360 go ahead to our call session started
10:45:18.840 here and let's add two things. The first
10:45:21.840 one will be event payload with a type of
10:45:24.240 call session started event which we
10:45:26.276 imported from here from stream io node
10:45:29.040 SDK and then we destructure the meeting
10:45:31.520 ID from event call custom meeting ID.
10:45:35.120 Make sure to put a question mark here.
10:45:36.720 So what is custom? If you remember in
10:45:39.360 our meetings procedures when we do the
10:45:42.520 create we do await call create and we
10:45:46.000 add the custom fields here meeting ID
10:45:48.480 and meeting name. So that's how we
10:45:50.720 access the meeting ID here even though
10:45:53.680 it's a web hook with no meeting
10:45:55.840 information. So that's why we needed it.
10:45:57.840 And we can actually remove this to-do
10:45:59.360 text. Now we fixed that. Now in here we
10:46:03.200 have to check if we don't have a meeting
10:46:05.276 ID because then we can just throw the
10:46:08.360 error. What we have to do now is we have
10:46:11.040 to find an existing meeting under
10:46:12.960 certain conditions. First of all
10:46:14.640 including the matching meeting ID. So
10:46:17.360 existing meeting await database select
10:46:19.680 from meetings where the matching meeting
10:46:22.880 ID is found but also we have to ensure
10:46:26.080 that it's its status is not completed or
10:46:29.596 active right. Uh and we can also add if
10:46:32.800 it's not
10:46:34.200 cancelled. So under no circumstances uh
10:46:37.596 should we find this meeting. The only
10:46:39.916 one we should actually look for is
10:46:41.436 upcoming. So if you want to you can
10:46:43.200 actually set equals
10:46:45.800 meeting status upcoming right or you can
10:46:50.160 simply use the the reverse values if you
10:46:52.400 want to be
10:46:53.320 explicit. Great. Now let's go ahead and
10:46:56.320 let's throw an error here if that kind
10:46:59.840 of meeting was not found. And
10:47:01.596 immediately what I want to do here is
10:47:04.320 update this meeting to a status of
10:47:06.880 active just in case this fires twice
10:47:10.880 because I found some rare cases where
10:47:13.040 that can happen especially if it's been
10:47:15.120 errored and then it may be retrieded. So
10:47:17.596 it's important to update the meeting
10:47:20.720 status to active as soon as possible
10:47:23.596 because what we're going to do now is
10:47:25.520 connect the agent. So if this event
10:47:28.080 accidentally fires multiple times, it
10:47:30.240 will connect multiple agents which is
10:47:32.080 not good, right? So that's why we
10:47:35.040 immediately set it to active. So if even
10:47:37.436 if it fires next time, this will fail,
10:47:40.960 right? Because in here we explicitly say
10:47:44.080 that it must not be
10:47:46.840 active. And you can also add not
10:47:50.400 processing here. There we go. So now we
10:47:53.276 explicitly add all uh states that we
10:47:55.596 don't want to have access to or you can
10:47:57.436 use the reverse and just target the
10:47:59.200 upcoming ones. Uh great. So now what we
10:48:03.120 want to do is we want to find the
10:48:05.436 existing agent for this meeting that we
10:48:08.160 just updated. So existing agent using
10:48:10.320 agents ID not match existing meeting
10:48:12.880 agent ID. If such an agent does not
10:48:16.400 exist, we throw an error. And now we can
10:48:20.960 connect to the stream video call using
10:48:23.360 the exact same method as we did in our
10:48:25.276 create procedure here. So now that is
10:48:27.040 the same instance. And before we go any
10:48:29.756 further, we now have to install a
10:48:31.596 package for open AAI agent to connect.
10:48:35.436 So I'm just going to shut this down and
10:48:37.520 I will do mpm install
10:48:40.520 stream-io openai realtime API- legacy
10:48:44.640 pure deps. And I will do mpm rundev
10:48:48.480 here. And just make sure you have your
10:48:50.320 webc running web hook running here. And
10:48:53.120 then inside of my package json, I will
10:48:55.200 stream simply show you all of my stream
10:48:57.360 versions just in case yours keep failing
10:48:59.916 and you don't know why it might be due
10:49:01.680 to newer versions. So you can always use
10:49:04.320 the exact same versions as I do if you
10:49:06.560 prefer doing so. Let's go ahead now uh
10:49:09.916 and let's actually connect the agent.
10:49:13.596 So we're going to do that by adding a
10:49:15.916 realtime client to be await stream
10:49:19.080 video connect open AI pass it the call
10:49:22.800 instance and then pass it open AI API
10:49:25.596 key to be process environment open AAI
10:49:28.160 API key always double check this by
10:49:30.800 copying it copying it from your
10:49:32.720 environment and pasting it here the
10:49:35.120 agent user ID will be existing agent do
10:49:38.560 ID right here perfect so now let's also
10:49:43.200 update the session for this real-time
10:49:45.320 client. Just be very very careful here.
10:49:49.120 This is not yet typed. So you can add
10:49:52.080 anything here and it will not throw
10:49:54.000 errors. So be very very careful to
10:49:56.640 correctly type this update session
10:49:59.040 instructions existing
10:50:01.640 agent.instructions like that. And that
10:50:04.320 is it. That's all we need for connecting
10:50:06.800 the agent to our uh
10:50:10.120 call. But before we test it out, let's
10:50:13.520 add one more event here. So let's do
10:50:15.756 else if event type is call session
10:50:18.640 participant left. So if anyone leaves
10:50:21.120 the call, first of all, let's establish
10:50:23.520 this to be the payload type call session
10:50:27.200 participant left event which we imported
10:50:30.000 and let's get the meeting ID. The only
10:50:32.640 problem is in here we need to use a
10:50:34.960 special way to obtain a meeting ID. We
10:50:37.360 can't do it the same way as in here
10:50:40.240 because there is no call event here
10:50:43.040 because this is a participant event,
10:50:46.000 right? So inside of the payload here, uh
10:50:49.360 you won't really have you can see you
10:50:51.520 have call C ID but you don't have the
10:50:54.080 call ID. So you have to access the
10:50:56.720 meeting ID like this. And if you're
10:50:58.560 wondering why that format, it's because
10:51:01.200 it's formatted as type and then colon
10:51:04.000 and then the ID. So that's why we need
10:51:06.560 it like that. But in case we cannot find
10:51:09.120 the meeting ID, throw an error and then
10:51:12.560 let's go ahead and connect to the call
10:51:14.560 again. So just as we did here above and
10:51:17.596 what we are going to do is we're going
10:51:19.436 to end the call. So the reason we are
10:51:22.400 doing this is as a fail safe just in
10:51:25.360 case uh so we don't leave our agents
10:51:28.000 hanging in the call too long and they
10:51:30.400 increase your usage on stream. So I
10:51:33.360 think we are now ready to test this out.
10:51:35.756 If you want to, you can comment out
10:51:37.120 these three events so you don't have any
10:51:39.120 errors here. And make sure you have your
10:51:42.080 local host running. Make sure you have
10:51:43.840 your angro running. And now what I
10:51:46.560 highly suggest that you do is first of
10:51:48.720 all clear all of your meetings. So I'm
10:51:51.360 going inside of my neon tables meetings
10:51:53.680 here and I have deleted all of my
10:51:55.916 meetings here and make sure to create
10:51:58.560 new meetings. You can ignore the fact
10:52:00.240 that one of mine is active. I was
10:52:01.916 testing it out. So, let's go ahead and
10:52:03.916 create a new one, math consultations.
10:52:06.240 And I created an agent, math tutor. And
10:52:09.200 I will click create
10:52:11.560 here. And just to show you this new
10:52:14.080 agent of mine, what instructions it has.
10:52:16.960 So, I just added you're a helpful math
10:52:19.040 assistant. That's it. And now I will
10:52:21.756 click start meeting here. And then I'm
10:52:25.120 going to click join call. And this will
10:52:27.840 fire an event. And as you can see, math
10:52:30.240 tutor has joined the call. And you can
10:52:33.276 see it immediately starts recording. Now
10:52:35.200 I'm going to ask it a question. What is
10:52:38.160 1 + 1?
10:52:42.880 1 + 1 = 2. Now, I don't know if you're
10:52:46.560 hearing the answer, but it's actually
10:52:48.480 telling me the answer. Perfect. So now
10:52:51.756 what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
10:52:53.520 inside of my Neon console and just
10:52:55.276 refresh my meetings. And this should now
10:52:58.080 have a status of active. And it does.
10:53:01.480 Perfect. Uh, and now what we can do here
10:53:05.756 is we can just end this call and go back
10:53:08.640 to meetings here. And you can see it
10:53:10.880 still says active. And that's fine
10:53:13.360 because we don't yet have a event which
10:53:16.640 will turn it into processing or
10:53:18.720 completed. So it's completely fine that
10:53:20.400 it still says active. And in here you
10:53:22.800 should now see this kind of screen here.
10:53:25.680 Amazing. amazing jobs. So, that's
10:53:27.436 exactly what I wanted us to do uh in
10:53:29.916 this chapter and we're going to leave
10:53:31.520 the rest in the next chapter when we
10:53:34.160 actually add some background jobs to
10:53:36.160 process what we just had. So, let's go
10:53:38.640 ahead and merge this now. So, I'm going
10:53:40.880 to go ahead uh and create a new branch
10:53:44.000 23 connecting
10:53:48.596 agents and I will stage all of my
10:53:51.960 changes. 23 connecting agents. Let's
10:53:55.916 commit and let's publish the
10:53:58.276 branch. And now let's go ahead and let's
10:54:01.756 review our code. I am just focused on
10:54:05.120 any potential issues or
10:54:07.640 bugs. And let's look at this chapter's
10:54:10.560 summary. So we introduced some new
10:54:12.320 features including a web hook endpoint
10:54:14.400 to handle video call events, enabling
10:54:16.400 real-time updates to meeting status and
10:54:18.400 agent integration. And we also added a
10:54:21.200 development script for web hook testing
10:54:23.436 and updated dependencies to support
10:54:25.596 realtime OpenAI
10:54:27.720 integration. In here we have the
10:54:29.840 sequence diagram explaining exactly what
10:54:32.080 happens in our web hook. So once the
10:54:34.000 event is hit, we validate the headers
10:54:36.160 and the signature parse JSON body and
10:54:38.480 event type and in the event call session
10:54:41.120 started. We find the meeting ID, fetch
10:54:43.756 the agent, and then we connect that
10:54:46.000 agent to the call and initialize
10:54:48.000 real-time client with agent
10:54:49.596 instructions. And when the participant
10:54:51.596 leaves, we end the call session.
10:54:54.596 Perfect. In here, it actually recommends
10:54:57.520 using an environment variable instead of
10:54:59.916 hard-coded text. And honestly, I didn't
10:55:02.080 even know you can do this. So, if you
10:55:04.320 want to, feel free to change it to an
10:55:05.840 environment variable like this. You
10:55:07.916 learn new things every day. Uh in here
10:55:11.360 it suggests wrapping our web hooks
10:55:13.596 inside of a try and catch. Um we might
10:55:16.160 look into that after we've wrapped up
10:55:17.680 the entire web hook event. And in here
10:55:20.800 it suggests already updating the
10:55:22.640 meeting. So it's very aware of our
10:55:24.640 codebase. It knows that we expect the
10:55:26.960 status completed and ended at at some
10:55:29.360 point. So it's super impressive how it
10:55:31.360 knows our schema. But this is not the
10:55:34.080 place to do that. Completed is a status
10:55:36.560 that will be handled differently in
10:55:39.116 here. another try cache suggestion and
10:55:41.276 I'm satisfied with our code. So let's go
10:55:43.436 ahead and merge it. And once you've
10:55:45.756 merged it, go back into your main branch
10:55:48.640 and go ahead and hit synchronize
10:55:51.080 changes. And then you should see the new
10:55:53.840 branch 23 merged to your project.
10:55:57.436 Amazing amazing job and see you in the
10:55:59.756 next
10:56:01.320 chapter. In this chapter, we're going to
10:56:03.840 implement background jobs into our
10:56:06.000 project. Let's start by completing these
10:56:09.680 three web hook events from our previous
10:56:12.640 uh web hook implementation. So right now
10:56:15.436 I don't have anything running and I am
10:56:18.160 on my main branch. I'm going to go
10:56:20.800 inside of source app API web hook route.
10:56:24.480 DS and the first thing I want to add is
10:56:27.436 call session ended. So let's go ahead
10:56:31.200 and add an else if here.
10:56:35.116 event type is equal to call session
10:56:39.160 ended and inside of here I want to get
10:56:43.200 the event as call ended event which we
10:56:46.080 can now uncomment as well as these two
10:56:49.520 and we can get the meeting ID from call
10:56:52.480 custom because this is a call event this
10:56:55.200 was a session participant event so
10:56:57.276 that's why we had to do a different way
10:56:59.360 of grabbing the meeting ID but in here
10:57:01.436 we can use our custom field and check if
10:57:03.680 it's missing and throw an error. And if
10:57:06.640 it is uh actually finished and we have
10:57:10.000 the meeting ID, we can go ahead and
10:57:12.160 update that meeting to be processing and
10:57:14.960 give it the ended at date and only do
10:57:18.720 that if we have a matching meeting ID
10:57:21.756 and the meeting status is active. So in
10:57:24.160 case this fires twice, we don't want to
10:57:26.880 add new ended at date here. We can only
10:57:29.680 do it once. So we are only doing it for
10:57:32.640 a meeting which was currently set to
10:57:35.116 active and now it's set to
10:57:37.720 processing. So that's one event down.
10:57:40.720 Now let's do transcription ready and
10:57:42.880 call recording ready. So let's start
10:57:45.840 with the transcription ready event. Else
10:57:49.276 if event
10:57:51.240 type is equal to this. So in here we
10:57:55.756 have to do the same thing. get the event
10:57:58.480 payload as call transcription ready
10:58:00.720 event and get the meeting ID using the
10:58:02.720 call C ID and split because of the
10:58:05.276 specific format here and then in here
10:58:08.480 we're going to go ahead and we are going
10:58:11.116 to update the meeting with the new
10:58:14.160 transcript URL. So updated meeting and
10:58:18.480 set transcript URL to be event call
10:58:22.276 transcription dot URL where we have a
10:58:25.360 matching meeting ID here. And then I'm
10:58:28.160 going to add to-do call ingest
10:58:31.436 background job to summarize the
10:58:35.320 transcript like that. So what we can do
10:58:38.400 here for now is check if there is no
10:58:40.800 updated meeting and then we can uh
10:58:43.520 simply throw an error like we did in the
10:58:46.880 previous
10:58:48.840 instances. Meeting not found. And let's
10:58:52.800 do a 404
10:58:55.080 here. And let's go ahead and do one more
10:58:58.916 event. So we can actually copy
10:59:01.360 everything from here. And let's do else
10:59:04.040 if event
10:59:06.040 type is
10:59:10.200 call.recording
10:59:12.276 ready. You can go ahead and paste
10:59:14.400 everything inside of here. And this will
10:59:16.400 be the call recording ready event.
10:59:19.840 Meeting ID will be accessed the same
10:59:21.680 way. And in here you won't have to
10:59:24.640 actually return this at all. Just go
10:59:27.596 ahead and update and set the new call
10:59:30.080 recording URL. So these events will only
10:59:33.756 fire the call recording ready and the
10:59:36.160 transcription ready if in the meeting
10:59:39.960 procedures you enabled the transcription
10:59:43.116 to be auto on and recording auto on.
10:59:47.116 Otherwise these events will not fire at
10:59:50.080 all. So what I suggest you do now is go
10:59:53.116 inside of your neon console tables
10:59:55.276 meetings here uh and delete all of your
10:59:58.640 meetings. Make sure you have a clean
11:00:00.880 slate here. Then go ahead and do npm
11:00:04.640 rundev and npm rundev web hook. So you
11:00:08.960 have a web hook running. Now let's go
11:00:11.680 ahead and refresh and I'm going to
11:00:13.200 create a new uh meeting
11:00:16.116 here. Okay. So I just created a new
11:00:19.116 meeting and I'm going to start the
11:00:21.200 meeting and I will have just a quick
11:00:23.116 conversation with uh the math tutor
11:00:26.400 which should join any second.
11:00:29.756 And now that it has answered my
11:00:31.596 question, I will simply end the call and
11:00:34.640 I will go back to meetings here. And you
11:00:36.640 can see that now this is actually set to
11:00:39.320 processing because it actually captured
11:00:42.640 my call session ended and it set it to
11:00:46.080 processing here. And what should be
11:00:48.640 happening now is I should be receiving
11:00:51.436 my transcription ready and recording
11:00:54.480 ready events. And I should be able to
11:00:57.040 see that in here if it's finished. I can
11:01:00.320 see the transcript URL and the recording
11:01:03.040 URL. So in the transcript URL here, you
11:01:06.000 can see what we talked about, right? And
11:01:09.116 in the recording URL, you will be able
11:01:12.000 to see uh the actual recording of the
11:01:16.240 event. Perfect. So both of these are
11:01:18.560 actually working. Looks like we have uh
11:01:20.800 successfully created recording ready and
11:01:23.276 transcription ready events.
11:01:26.480 Now that we have finished all of our web
11:01:29.040 hook events, let's go ahead and let's
11:01:31.520 implement a proper background job by
11:01:34.480 configuring inest. So you can use the
11:01:36.800 link in the description to let them know
11:01:38.880 you came from this video. And now let's
11:01:41.596 go ahead and let's go inside of
11:01:43.640 documentation get started. You won't
11:01:45.840 even need to create an account. So let's
11:01:47.596 go inside of Next.js here. Make sure you
11:01:50.800 select the app router. So in here I
11:01:53.436 already have my app running. So no need
11:01:55.520 to do that. But let's go ahead and let's
11:01:57.436 install
11:01:58.756 inest. So I'm just going to go ahead and
11:02:01.200 do that here. And I will just add legacy
11:02:04.240 here dep so it doesn't fail with the
11:02:09.000 installation. Now that I have installed
11:02:11.436 it, let me show you the version. So
11:02:15.560 337.0 just for your information. And now
11:02:18.720 let's run the ingest dev server. So I'm
11:02:22.000 going to go ahead here and I will have
11:02:24.240 it running the same way I have my web
11:02:26.720 hooks running. So alongside mpm rundev I
11:02:29.596 have my web hook running and now I will
11:02:31.840 have inest cli
11:02:34.680 dev. So if it asks you to upgrade feel
11:02:38.000 free to upgrade to use the latest
11:02:39.596 version. This is the version I'm using
11:02:41.200 for this tutorial. You can also specify
11:02:43.596 that version here if you want
11:02:45.800 to. And immediately upon running this uh
11:02:49.276 you will see that it is actually
11:02:50.960 scanning my localhost 3000 for any kind
11:02:54.400 of ingest functions. And you can see how
11:02:56.560 my npm rundev has a bunch of 404s
11:03:00.000 because we haven't added any functions
11:03:02.640 yet. But what you can do now is you can
11:03:04.960 visit localhost
11:03:06.916 8288. Let me go ahead and paste that
11:03:10.160 here so you can see it. Let me go all
11:03:12.320 the way down.
11:03:14.720 So you can go to localhost
11:03:17.160 8288 and you can actually see the ingest
11:03:20.160 dev server and inside of here you will
11:03:23.040 see all the functions that we create and
11:03:25.200 all the steps and background jobs that
11:03:27.116 we will we will be able to run. So now
11:03:30.160 let's go ahead and let's actually create
11:03:32.160 a background
11:03:33.720 job. For that we can simply follow the
11:03:37.680 uh documentation. So let's just go back
11:03:41.320 here. After we run this, let's go ahead
11:03:44.320 and let's create the ingest client. So
11:03:47.680 I'm going to close everything here. I'm
11:03:49.116 going to go inside of source and I will
11:03:50.480 create a new folder called ingest like
11:03:53.916 that. And inside I will create a
11:03:56.596 client.ts. And I will paste this inside.
11:03:59.916 And I will call this meet AI 2 simply
11:04:03.200 because I already named one meet AI. So
11:04:05.916 I don't want any conflicts just in case.
11:04:08.960 After that, let's go ahead and create an
11:04:11.360 API folder with the ingest route. So,
11:04:14.720 this server will actually be able to
11:04:16.560 find it and it won't have to scan for
11:04:19.480 404s. Let's go inside of app API. Let's
11:04:22.400 create a new ingest folder. And inside,
11:04:25.116 let's create a
11:04:26.360 route.ts. And let's go ahead and copy
11:04:29.596 this. And let's paste it inside. And I
11:04:32.480 will just change this to use our uh at
11:04:35.756 sign. There we go. So make sure to put
11:04:38.000 it inside of API inest
11:04:40.680 route.ts. It needs to be called inest.
11:04:43.276 And finally you can now see this npx
11:04:46.640 inest cli is hitting the correct uh
11:04:50.000 route here. So it finally found inest in
11:04:52.560 our project. And now let's go ahead and
11:04:55.116 let's write our first function here. So
11:04:57.840 I'm going to go inside of ingest and
11:04:59.520 create
11:05:00.436 functions.ts. And I will paste the hello
11:05:02.880 world function here. And I will import
11:05:05.116 this from ingest client. So it will be
11:05:08.800 called hello world here. And you can see
11:05:11.436 it accepts some data. It even waits for
11:05:14.480 a
11:05:15.800 second. Now that we have this defined,
11:05:19.040 we're going to have to add this back to
11:05:21.360 our route. So let's go inside of the
11:05:24.160 route here. U and my apologies, the
11:05:28.000 functions.ts DS files should be created
11:05:31.116 in inest folder here next to the client,
11:05:34.880 not in the API route. My apologies for
11:05:38.240 that. So the API inest should just have
11:05:41.040 a route and the actual source inest
11:05:44.240 should have the functions. Now let's go
11:05:46.320 inside of the ingest route and inside of
11:05:48.240 here let's add our hello world from
11:05:51.360 ingest functions. And immediately upon
11:05:54.160 doing that, if you go inside of your
11:05:56.960 local host 3 uh not 3000 but
11:05:59.880 8282, you will see in the functions a
11:06:03.116 hello world function. And in here you
11:06:05.520 can invoke it and you can pass email to
11:06:08.480 be
11:06:10.116 hello@mail.com and click invoke this
11:06:12.480 function. And you can see you now have a
11:06:15.040 run here which first waits for 1 second
11:06:18.640 and then says hello and your email. So
11:06:22.480 that's how these background jobs will
11:06:24.640 work. But ex instead of triggering them
11:06:27.276 from this dashboard, we are going to
11:06:29.116 trigger them from actual code and they
11:06:31.436 will simply work in the background. You
11:06:33.840 won't have to await it. You can tell
11:06:35.436 your user to log out and they can take a
11:06:37.596 walk and this will still be completed
11:06:40.480 without them. That's the power of
11:06:42.800 background jobs. you don't have to worry
11:06:44.800 about them timing out or erroring
11:06:47.116 because these individual steps will
11:06:49.360 retry themselves until they succeed or
11:06:52.480 until you put a limit on retries. So now
11:06:55.840 that we have established this, we can go
11:06:58.960 ahead and we can actually
11:07:02.000 uh create everything we need. So let's
11:07:04.560 create our own uh inest function now. So
11:07:08.640 the way we're going to do that is by
11:07:11.040 going back inside of the functions here
11:07:13.276 in the ingest and let's remove the hello
11:07:15.360 world function and instead we are going
11:07:18.720 to add export const meetings processing
11:07:22.240 to be
11:07:23.560 ingest.create function. The ID will be
11:07:26.960 meetings
11:07:28.916 slprocessing and the event will be
11:07:32.480 meetings forward
11:07:35.400 slashprocessing and then we're going to
11:07:37.276 have an asynchronous function which
11:07:39.116 destructures the event and the
11:07:42.360 step and inside we're going to start
11:07:44.960 defining the steps we need to process
11:07:46.880 our meeting.
11:07:49.596 Now the first step here will be to fetch
11:07:53.436 event data transcript URL. That's
11:07:56.240 because if you go inside of our web hook
11:07:59.000 route when we call transcription ready
11:08:02.840 here we added a to-do call the ingest
11:08:06.480 background job to summarize the
11:08:08.080 transcript. So at the point that this
11:08:10.160 function is called we will have this
11:08:12.960 stored inside of the updated meeting. So
11:08:16.080 we are going to pass that along here as
11:08:18.560 transcript URL and we can use inest
11:08:21.720 step.fetch as an optimized way to fetch
11:08:24.560 in a background job. So no matter how
11:08:27.040 long this takes background job will take
11:08:29.680 care of it. You won't have to worry
11:08:31.116 about it failing or anything else. Now
11:08:34.240 what we have to do is we have to parse
11:08:36.800 this because this is currently in JSON L
11:08:40.320 format. So it's not exactly workable
11:08:42.880 with in JavaScript by default. So what
11:08:45.276 we have to do is we have to add mpm
11:08:48.320 install jsonl l parse stringify and
11:08:52.080 let's add legacy pier deps
11:08:54.916 here once it's installed you can exit
11:08:58.800 and let's go ahead and import it
11:09:01.320 here jsonl from jsonl parse stringify
11:09:06.480 and in here what we're going to do is
11:09:08.720 call this a transcript and do await
11:09:11.480 steprun and this will be a custom that
11:09:15.040 called parse transcript like that. Let's
11:09:18.720 open up an asynchronous method here. And
11:09:21.840 first things first, let's go ahead and
11:09:24.160 await the response which we just fetched
11:09:26.400 above and turn it into a text. And then
11:09:28.880 we will simply return JSON L parse and
11:09:32.560 pass in the text like this. The only
11:09:36.080 problem is currently we don't really
11:09:38.400 know the type that is waiting for us.
11:09:42.560 But thanks to this JSON LS uh JSON L
11:09:45.840 parse function, we can actually add the
11:09:48.080 type. So let's go inside of our modules.
11:09:50.800 Let's go inside of meetings. And let's
11:09:52.240 go inside of types. And down here, I'm
11:09:55.200 going to add a new type called stream
11:09:57.520 transcript item including speaker ID,
11:10:00.240 type text, start, and stop. How do I
11:10:03.200 know that these are the ones I
11:10:05.880 need? Because of our transcript uh URL,
11:10:10.800 right? So I just visited my previous
11:10:12.880 transcript URL which we demonstrated to
11:10:15.116 confirm it's working. And in here you
11:10:16.720 can see speaker ID start timestamp top
11:10:20.000 stop timestamp type and text. So that's
11:10:23.520 why I know that those are the things I
11:10:25.596 need. So inside of here I can now append
11:10:28.960 stream transcript item from modules
11:10:32.080 meetings types like this. And now when I
11:10:35.436 hover over a transcript you can see
11:10:37.200 exactly what I expect inside. Perfect.
11:10:40.480 Now the problem is uh I can't really do
11:10:43.756 much just by having speaker ids. We need
11:10:46.720 to populate them and connect them to the
11:10:48.560 users from our
11:10:50.436 database. Quick interruption from future
11:10:53.436 me. Just a heads up. Right now we're
11:10:56.720 using step.fetch fetch and this works
11:10:59.840 fine locally during development but once
11:11:03.360 we deploy which will happen in a few
11:11:05.400 chapters this line will break in
11:11:08.480 production causing a malformed JSON
11:11:12.116 object. The fix though is very very
11:11:15.916 simple. All we have to do is modify from
11:11:19.040 step
11:11:20.436 fetch to this. basically calling your
11:11:24.560 normal fetch inside of a
11:11:28.116 step. And then chain then and turn the
11:11:33.436 response into text. The problem now is
11:11:37.116 that we also have to modify this line.
11:11:40.000 But that's not a problem either. Instead
11:11:42.480 of using the response.ext here in this
11:11:46.680 step, we're just going to go ahead and
11:11:49.276 parse it and do nothing more. So this is
11:11:52.960 what I would suggest you change your
11:11:55.436 code to. Even though the code will
11:11:58.800 switch back to the old version once I
11:12:01.200 unpause this interruption, I recommend
11:12:04.320 using this updated version going forward
11:12:07.916 to avoid any issues later on. All right,
11:12:11.680 now back to the current
11:12:15.240 timeline. So let's add another step
11:12:18.080 called transcript with speakers.
11:12:20.320 step.run run add speakers. And inside of
11:12:23.840 here, the first thing we're going to do
11:12:25.840 is we're going to establish all the ids
11:12:29.200 from our transcript. So, we're going to
11:12:31.436 be using a set to avoid any duplicates.
11:12:34.800 So, all of them will be under speaker
11:12:37.276 ID. And you can see how thanks to this
11:12:39.360 type here, we have strict typing here.
11:12:42.160 So, we don't make a mistake. Just double
11:12:44.080 check that you actually have speaker ID
11:12:46.080 here. You can find it here in your
11:12:48.160 meetings. just find a recording or
11:12:50.320 transcript URL to check. Great. Now,
11:12:53.436 let's go uh back to our app here. And
11:12:56.480 once we have speaker ids, let's go ahead
11:12:59.680 and let's get all user speakers because
11:13:03.596 half of them will be agent speakers. So,
11:13:07.116 user speakers will need a database. It
11:13:10.080 will need the user schema. It will need
11:13:13.200 in array from Drizzle OM. So make sure
11:13:16.320 you have imported the database user
11:13:18.880 schema and Drizzle
11:13:22.040 OM. Great. Now that we have all of
11:13:25.520 these, we have the user speakers and we
11:13:27.360 can now do the exact same thing but for
11:13:30.160 the agent speakers, but instead of
11:13:32.960 calling users, we are calling agents
11:13:35.756 here. So make sure you've added the
11:13:38.000 agents schema. Perfect. And now let's
11:13:41.840 unify them all together in a constant
11:13:44.320 called speakers. So we are combining the
11:13:47.040 user speakers and the agent speakers
11:13:49.400 here. And we are going to return
11:13:52.916 transcript.m mapap get the individual
11:13:55.680 item here. And now we are going to
11:13:58.080 attempt to find the matching speaker ID
11:14:01.200 with all of these speakers combined. So
11:14:03.680 we are going to load uh something either
11:14:06.240 an agent or a
11:14:07.880 user. And then if we don't find any
11:14:11.640 speaker, we are just going to return
11:14:14.800 this existing transcript item and we're
11:14:17.200 going to set the username to be unknown
11:14:19.680 because we cannot find that user in our
11:14:22.276 database. Otherwise, let's return this
11:14:25.276 existing item. But we are appending the
11:14:27.680 user object with the proper speaker
11:14:29.756 name. So we know exactly who was
11:14:32.480 speaking at that time. Perfect. And that
11:14:35.680 is our job for actually adding the uh
11:14:40.880 adding the speakers to the
11:14:43.560 transcript. Now we have to build an
11:14:46.240 agent here. So uh inest has their own
11:14:49.840 agent kit which we can implement and
11:14:52.080 then use as a step. So we can actually
11:14:55.360 connect open AI to ingest. But in order
11:14:58.880 to do that, we first have to go to uh
11:15:01.436 our assets repository here and find
11:15:05.040 system prompt. You can use the link in
11:15:06.880 the description to find this and go
11:15:08.400 ahead and simply copy this entire
11:15:10.240 prompt. Now go to the top of your
11:15:12.640 meetings processing function here and
11:15:14.720 create a
11:15:16.520 summarizer and give it a create agent
11:15:19.596 function and you can import create agent
11:15:22.800 from another package that we have to
11:15:24.640 install. So let's just do that. npm
11:15:26.800 install inest agent kit legacy pier
11:15:31.240 deps. So after it's installed, let's go
11:15:34.480 back here and let's import create agent,
11:15:38.000 open AI and text message all from ing
11:15:40.400 inest agent kit. Inside of the create
11:15:43.200 agent here, give it a name of
11:15:45.640 summarizer. Again, give it a system
11:15:48.320 prompt of the following. Open backpix.
11:15:51.360 And now you will simply copy the system
11:15:54.080 prompt and paste it here.
11:15:56.480 And then go ahead and simply add dot
11:15:59.040 trim here and add a
11:16:01.960 model. And in here add open AI. And we
11:16:06.320 imported this from here. Right? So open
11:16:09.360 AI model. Choose whichever model you
11:16:12.960 want. I'm going to choose 4 O and API
11:16:16.960 key will be
11:16:18.916 process.vironment open AI API key.
11:16:22.080 Always double check. Make sure it's the
11:16:24.640 proper one. There we go. Uh, perfect.
11:16:28.320 So, we now have this, which means that
11:16:30.960 we can now actually summarize this. So,
11:16:33.916 after transcript with
11:16:36.200 speakers, we can go ahead and create
11:16:39.040 another step using await
11:16:42.360 summarizer.run, give it summarize the
11:16:44.560 following transcript, and then use JSON
11:16:47.400 stringify transcript with speakers
11:16:50.320 because we now have them with speakers
11:16:52.240 here.
11:16:53.360 And once you actually have the output,
11:16:55.916 you're going to add one more
11:17:01.160 step. And add save summary asynchronous
11:17:06.596 method and await database.
11:17:10.240 Update meetings and set the summary here
11:17:15.200 to be output first in the array as text
11:17:19.520 message which is our type we imported
11:17:22.240 from inest agent kit dot content as
11:17:26.360 string and set the status to completed
11:17:30.040 finally and only do that where our
11:17:33.756 meetings ID uh matches the event data
11:17:37.840 meeting ID. be mindful. Uh, oh yes,
11:17:40.880 let's import meetings from database
11:17:42.480 schema. My apologies. And let's import
11:17:44.480 equals from Drizzle OM. So, make sure
11:17:47.756 you have added meetings here. And, uh,
11:17:50.240 equals from Drizzle OM. Make sure you
11:17:53.040 don't misspell the event data meeting ID
11:17:55.756 because this can be anything. It's not
11:17:57.596 strictly typed. Same goes with uh, event
11:18:01.360 data transcript URL.
11:18:04.960 All that's left to do now is go back
11:18:07.116 inside of our web hook here, find the
11:18:10.080 call transcription ready, remove the
11:18:12.960 to-do here, and do await ingest, which
11:18:16.480 you can import from ingest
11:18:20.436 client dot send name will be meetings
11:18:25.800 processing. So just make sure you don't
11:18:27.916 misspell it. You can copy it from here
11:18:30.320 and then paste it here. and data and
11:18:34.560 simply pass in the meeting ID and the
11:18:39.200 transcript URL from this updated meeting
11:18:42.160 which we've had right here. Perfect. And
11:18:45.756 we must not forget to now go inside of
11:18:49.520 API inest route and instead of hello
11:18:52.320 world add meetings processing here. And
11:18:56.160 you can confirm you've done it correctly
11:18:57.916 by going inside of your functions here.
11:19:00.160 Let's go ahead and refresh. and you now
11:19:01.840 have the meetings processing. Uh, but if
11:19:05.276 you try it with this data, it will just
11:19:07.116 fail. So, the best way to test this out
11:19:10.480 is to go ahead and have a new meeting.
11:19:13.680 So, that's what I'm going to try out
11:19:15.960 now. So, I just started math
11:19:18.480 consultations 3 and I will simply ask a
11:19:20.800 question here and then we're going to
11:19:22.720 look if any runs will start
11:19:25.596 automatically here.
11:19:28.560 I'm now going to end the call which will
11:19:31.680 now trigger the processing mode for that
11:19:35.116 consultations here and it will also wait
11:19:37.756 for the web hook to hit and once the web
11:19:40.400 hook hits you can see that we run the
11:19:43.116 meetings processing function. So the
11:19:45.756 first step was to fetch the transcript
11:19:48.240 URL which you can see right here worked.
11:19:51.916 It has the speaker ID here and
11:19:54.160 everything. Then we parse the
11:19:55.916 transcript. So we turn it into JSON.
11:19:58.560 Then we add the usernames. So this is me
11:20:02.240 John Doe and this is math tutor. So we
11:20:04.480 use the speaker ID to find that. And
11:20:06.960 then finally we used chat GPT to
11:20:10.400 summarize the transcript. And you can
11:20:12.400 see that we have the content result
11:20:14.160 here. And we saved that summary. And now
11:20:18.000 if I refresh my database here, I should
11:20:20.800 see a summary text inside of here. And I
11:20:24.880 will also see the status to be
11:20:27.276 completed. So if I go back here, this
11:20:29.680 now finally says completed. And you can
11:20:31.596 also see we have proper duration here.
11:20:34.160 Amazing. Amazing job. So we now have
11:20:37.200 everything ready uh to display the last
11:20:40.320 components for this app. So now let's
11:20:42.800 review and merge this pull
11:20:44.840 request. I'm going to go ahead and open
11:20:47.840 a new
11:20:48.916 branch. 24 background jobs. Once I'm in
11:20:53.200 a new branch, I'm going to stage all of
11:20:55.360 my changes and I will write a commit
11:20:59.240 message. Let's commit and let's publish
11:21:01.756 the
11:21:03.000 branch. And now let's review our pull
11:21:10.360 request. And here we have the summary.
11:21:14.080 So what I'm interested in here is the
11:21:16.640 walkthrough. This update introduces
11:21:19.436 injust based eventdriven processing for
11:21:21.840 meeting transcripts, adds new
11:21:23.596 dependencies and expands web hook logic
11:21:26.000 to handle additional event types. We
11:21:28.320 implement a function for AI powered
11:21:30.240 meeting summarization and we update
11:21:32.080 database records accordingly. We also
11:21:34.400 introduced a new type for transcription
11:21:36.240 items and some minor formatting changes.
11:21:39.116 So this is basically the goal of this
11:21:41.276 chapter inest based eventdriven
11:21:44.160 processing background jobs. something
11:21:46.240 the user doesn't have to wait for and
11:21:48.480 something that we don't have to await or
11:21:51.436 uh be afraid that it will fail, right?
11:21:53.680 The user can take a walk, the user can
11:21:55.596 go away. That's the power of background
11:21:57.756 jobs. They can simply do whatever they
11:21:59.680 want while they wait. So once the web
11:22:02.720 hook reaches the proper uh event type,
11:22:05.680 we update the meeting status and fields
11:22:07.916 and we dispatch the meetings processing
11:22:10.080 event with meeting ID and the transcript
11:22:12.160 URL to ingest. After that, we meet we
11:22:15.436 trigger the meeting processing function
11:22:18.240 and we fetch the transcript URL and
11:22:21.040 speaker info. We then send the enriched
11:22:24.320 transcript to summarization to AI and we
11:22:26.960 return the summary and notes and finally
11:22:29.680 update and set it as completed. In here
11:22:32.960 we do have some uh recommendations and
11:22:36.000 this is not an uh uh an SD SDK does not
11:22:39.916 accept this kind of format. So it
11:22:41.680 actually gives you a suggestion even in
11:22:43.436 that case if agent kit doesn't support
11:22:45.756 this format at minimum use template
11:22:47.916 literal. So it's basically suggesting us
11:22:49.840 to use template literal instead of
11:22:52.400 joining like this basically to avoid
11:22:55.436 potential prompt injection. So if you
11:22:58.400 want to you can change this. I might
11:22:59.916 change it in the next chapter. And the
11:23:02.320 rest of the refactor suggest suggestions
11:23:04.400 are basically just error handling
11:23:06.160 suggestions which inest does a pretty
11:23:08.320 good job of just by itself. So, no need
11:23:10.480 to do any of that. We can just go ahead
11:23:12.720 and merge this pull request. And once
11:23:15.520 you've merged it, go back to main and go
11:23:18.080 ahead and synchronize the changes like
11:23:20.880 that. And now inside of your graph here,
11:23:23.360 you should see that you have merged 24
11:23:26.080 background jobs. That marks the end of
11:23:29.040 this chapter. Amazing job. And see you
11:23:31.596 in the next one.
11:23:33.840 In this chapter, we're going to go ahead
11:23:35.840 and implement the completed state with
11:23:38.160 the new summary which we generated in
11:23:40.400 the previous chapter using background
11:23:42.916 jobs. So let's go ahead into our project
11:23:45.680 and ensure that we are on the main
11:23:47.436 branch. Let's also make sure we are
11:23:49.520 running npm rundev rundev web hook and
11:23:52.880 npx inest cli. And then let's go ahead
11:23:56.560 to our meetings page. Once in the
11:23:59.840 meetings page, ensure that you have at
11:24:01.436 least one meeting with a completed
11:24:03.040 status. If not, have a new meeting and
11:24:05.756 wait for it to be completed. You will
11:24:07.916 know it's properly completed by going
11:24:09.916 inside of your database and confirming
11:24:12.000 that at least one of them has a summary
11:24:14.560 like
11:24:15.560 this. And now let's implement the
11:24:18.000 completed
11:24:19.880 state. Let's go inside of meeting ID
11:24:23.680 view and let's find the is completed
11:24:26.160 which renders the completed text. Let's
11:24:28.560 replace it with completed state and pass
11:24:30.480 in the data which is our use suspense
11:24:32.800 query data. Now let's create the
11:24:35.596 completed state inside of components.
11:24:38.160 Create completed state
11:24:40.756 dsx. Let's export con completed state
11:24:43.840 right here. And let's go ahead and let's
11:24:46.720 create the interface
11:24:48.680 for let's import meeting get one from
11:24:52.080 our types which are located in the
11:24:54.560 meetings module. Right here we have
11:24:56.640 meeting get one. And now in here we can
11:24:59.596 go ahead and destructure the props and
11:25:01.436 grab our data right here. Now let's go
11:25:04.960 ahead and let's return a
11:25:07.400 div with flex flex column and gap y of
11:25:11.800 four. Let's go ahead and add semicolons
11:25:15.200 here. And let's import the completed
11:25:17.480 state so we can actually render it. And
11:25:20.320 you should have no errors with the
11:25:21.680 types. When you refresh, nothing should
11:25:24.160 be visible in your completed meeting
11:25:25.840 because we haven't rendered any text
11:25:28.436 yet. Now, let's go ahead and let's
11:25:30.880 import everything we need from our
11:25:33.040 components UI scroll area and components
11:25:35.596 UI tabs. So, we haven't used tabs yet,
11:25:38.400 but you have them inside of your source
11:25:40.400 components UI tabs. We've added that as
11:25:43.040 well as scroll area when the initialize
11:25:45.680 chats UI. Now, let's go ahead inside of
11:25:49.436 here. And the first thing we're going to
11:25:51.276 do is activate the tabs like this with
11:25:54.000 the default value of summary. Then
11:25:56.400 inside of the tabs we are going to add a
11:25:58.720 div with a background of white rounded
11:26:01.360 large border and px of three. Then we
11:26:04.720 are going to open the scroll area and
11:26:06.400 inside we are going to render the scroll
11:26:08.240 bar. The scroll bar will have an
11:26:10.480 orientation of horizontal. Now, inside
11:26:13.436 of the scroll area, let's go ahead and
11:26:15.436 let's open the tabs list component with
11:26:18.160 class name padding zero, bg background,
11:26:20.960 justify start, rounded none, and height
11:26:23.840 of 13. Now, inside of here, let's add
11:26:27.116 the tabs trigger component. And let's
11:26:30.240 render an
11:26:32.680 icon book open text icon, which you can
11:26:35.680 import from Lucid React. Make sure to
11:26:38.000 add that. And let's give the tabs
11:26:40.400 trigger a value of
11:26:43.320 summary. And now if you take a look at
11:26:45.916 your app, you will see the summary tab
11:26:48.400 right here. Now let's go ahead and let's
11:26:50.800 import actually all icons we need from
11:26:53.680 Lucid React. So that will be sparklas
11:26:56.400 icon, file, text icon, book open text
11:26:59.116 icon, file, video icon, and clock fading
11:27:02.320 icon. Let me just move them to the top
11:27:04.756 here. And now let's go ahead inside of
11:27:07.916 this tabs trigger. And let's move this
11:27:11.596 down here because we're going to add a
11:27:13.596 pretty large class name here. So I'm
11:27:17.040 going to paste it here and I will you
11:27:19.840 can pause the video and copy it. So
11:27:22.160 basically text muted foreground rounded
11:27:24.640 none bg background. And now this is
11:27:27.320 important. Uh data state active and
11:27:31.040 shadow none are one class name, right?
11:27:33.436 So let me just temporarily remove this
11:27:35.596 so you can see this is how the class
11:27:38.160 name looks like. So whenever you write
11:27:39.840 data state active shadow none it's one
11:27:43.360 class name. It's just that I use uh this
11:27:46.400 collapse line uh settings which
11:27:49.200 collapses them. So if I zoom out you
11:27:51.436 will see that my data state active are
11:27:53.916 all in one line. So whenever you see
11:27:55.596 data state active just know that they
11:27:59.200 are supposed to be together with
11:28:00.880 whatever comes after the column like
11:28:03.436 this. Same is true for hover. Okay. So
11:28:08.240 after you've added this yours should
11:28:10.720 look like that. There we go. And now
11:28:13.756 we're going to go ahead and open uh copy
11:28:16.400 the taps trigger again. And the second
11:28:18.960 one will be transcript. And we're going
11:28:22.240 to use the file text icon and
11:28:26.680 transcript. And then we're going to have
11:28:29.436 the recording one. So I'm basically just
11:28:32.080 copying exactly uh as it is. All of them
11:28:35.596 have the same class names, right? Uh
11:28:37.840 this one will have file video icon and
11:28:39.916 the recording text and the value of
11:28:42.560 recording. And this one has the value of
11:28:44.400 transcript. And then the last one we're
11:28:46.960 going to
11:28:48.680 have is the chat value, sparkles icon,
11:28:53.276 and ask AI. So the class names are
11:28:55.916 identical in all of them. We are just
11:28:57.756 copying from the first one, changing the
11:29:00.000 icon value and the label inside. So now
11:29:03.360 you have the transcript, the recording,
11:29:05.116 and ask AI. And now we have to actually
11:29:08.480 create the content for each of these
11:29:10.880 tabs.
11:29:12.880 A pretty easy tab to make is the
11:29:15.116 recording tab. So, let's just go outside
11:29:17.200 of this div, but still inside of the
11:29:19.160 tabs.
11:29:21.160 Oops. And let's render tabs content with
11:29:24.320 value recording. Just make sure that it
11:29:26.880 matches the value here that you don't
11:29:28.400 have any typos. And the only thing we're
11:29:31.200 going to do is the following. We're
11:29:32.560 going to add a div with background white
11:29:34.560 rounded large and border. And then we're
11:29:37.436 just going to add some padding as well.
11:29:39.276 So let's just do that right here. px4
11:29:42.720 and py5. And the only thing we're going
11:29:45.360 to do is we're going to render a video.
11:29:48.320 So normal video and source data
11:29:50.880 recording URL with an exclamation point
11:29:52.880 because without it uh it can be
11:29:54.880 undefined. But we know that since is it
11:29:57.756 is in the completed state, it's always
11:29:59.840 going to exist. So we can safely just
11:30:01.436 put an exclamation point at the end uh
11:30:04.240 with full and rounded large. And let's
11:30:06.560 also add controls. And when you click on
11:30:08.400 recording now you will see the actual
11:30:10.560 recording uh that exists in the
11:30:12.800 recording URL here. Just one tip
11:30:16.040 recordings storage for recording and
11:30:18.400 transcription. These URLs here uh they
11:30:21.436 have an expiration date. They are
11:30:23.436 retained for 2 weeks before being
11:30:25.596 automatically deleted. But don't worry
11:30:28.160 if you want to keep them forever or just
11:30:30.160 not store them with stream. You can use
11:30:32.640 your own storage like Amazon, Google
11:30:35.116 Cloud or Asure. So go ahead and visit
11:30:38.320 video and audio, select platform and
11:30:40.880 recording storage and transcription
11:30:42.720 storage and follow the documentation to
11:30:44.640 add your own external storage if you
11:30:47.040 don't want this to expire. Great. So it
11:30:50.320 was that easy to add the tabs recording
11:30:52.640 and now we're going to go ahead and add
11:30:54.960 the summary
11:30:56.436 tab. Before we can implement the summary
11:30:59.436 tab, we have to install a package called
11:31:02.880 react markdown so we can properly render
11:31:06.400 our markdown because that's what we
11:31:08.160 instruct our assistant to do. So now
11:31:11.276 that we have that, let's go ahead and
11:31:13.360 let's make sure that we add an import
11:31:15.840 for markdown from React Markdown. Let's
11:31:19.200 also import link from next link. And
11:31:23.276 let's also import generated avatar from
11:31:27.040 components generated
11:31:29.960 avatar. Now let's go down there inside
11:31:33.040 of new tabs content. So I will add tabs
11:31:35.756 content here and I will give it a value
11:31:38.480 of summary and inside I will render a
11:31:41.436 div with background white rounded lg and
11:31:45.040 border. Then inside I'm going to render
11:31:48.160 another div with px4 py5 gap y5 flex
11:31:54.240 flex call and call span of five. Inside
11:31:58.560 I'm going to add an h2 element with text
11:32:01.200 to excel font medium and capitalize
11:32:03.596 rendering the data name. And you can see
11:32:05.916 that now when I click on summary I can
11:32:07.680 see this meeting's name. Just make sure
11:32:09.756 you didn't misspell the default value
11:32:11.840 the value in the trigger and the value
11:32:13.916 in the tabs content.
11:32:16.880 Below the meeting title, we're going to
11:32:19.200 end add the current agent that was
11:32:21.756 inside. So add a div with flex gap x2
11:32:24.880 and items center and add a link element.
11:32:28.960 We're going to give the link an href of
11:32:31.840 forward slash agents and then data agent
11:32:35.596 ID like this. And then let's go ahead
11:32:38.400 and give it a class name flex item
11:32:40.880 center gap x2 underline underline offset
11:32:44.240 4 and capitalize. And then inside of
11:32:47.360 this link let's render the generated
11:32:49.360 avatar which we imported previously with
11:32:52.160 variant bots neutral seed as the agent
11:32:55.040 name and class name size five. And below
11:32:57.840 it we can simply render the agent name
11:33:01.756 and then add an empty space after the
11:33:04.400 link here. And below that, let's go
11:33:07.276 ahead and let's add a paragraph to check
11:33:10.080 if we have started at. If we have it,
11:33:13.520 let's use format from date FNS. So, just
11:33:16.960 make sure you imported format from date
11:33:19.240 FNS. And you're going to
11:33:22.360 format data started at in this exact
11:33:26.596 format. So, there we go. Now, you can
11:33:29.276 see math tutor. And when I click on it,
11:33:31.360 it will take me directly to that meeting
11:33:33.596 here.
11:33:35.436 Now, below our agent here, outside of
11:33:39.200 this div, let's render a new div with
11:33:41.436 class name flex, gap x2, and item
11:33:44.240 center. Render our imported sparkles
11:33:46.720 icon. And oops, not this one. And render
11:33:49.520 the text general summary like this. And
11:33:52.960 then below that, let's go ahead and
11:33:54.960 let's add a badge from components UI
11:33:58.240 badge. And it's not going to be a
11:33:59.680 self-closing tag. So, make sure you just
11:34:01.436 added the badge from components UI
11:34:04.040 badge. Let's go ahead and let's give it
11:34:06.880 uh some attributes here. So, variant
11:34:09.200 outline and class name flex item center
11:34:11.756 gap x2 and target the SVG to give it
11:34:15.116 size 4. And inside of here, go ahead and
11:34:18.240 add it clock fading
11:34:21.400 icon. Now, let's go ahead and let's
11:34:23.840 revisit our columns for the meetings
11:34:26.640 here. And in here we have a function
11:34:28.720 format duration. Let's copy it and let's
11:34:32.000 add it inside of our lib and inside of
11:34:36.080 utils here. So after the function CN,
11:34:38.720 let's add export function format
11:34:41.520 duration and import humanize duration
11:34:44.080 from humanized duration because I want
11:34:46.000 to reuse it. So inside of my source
11:34:48.880 modules meetings components columns, I
11:34:51.916 no longer have to have it here. I can
11:34:54.960 instead go down to where I use it and
11:34:57.116 just import format duration from lib
11:35:01.080 utils right like that. That means I no
11:35:03.916 longer need this import. And there
11:35:06.400 should be no errors in your columns
11:35:08.320 here. Now go inside of the completed
11:35:10.560 state here and now below clock fading
11:35:13.276 icon. That's exactly what we're going to
11:35:15.276 do. So we're going to check if we have
11:35:17.276 the duration and then use our newly
11:35:19.756 added format duration. Make sure to
11:35:22.320 import it from lib utilus not from date
11:35:24.560 fns. So we use the same name. That's
11:35:27.040 unfortunate. You can change it if you
11:35:28.800 want to. Just make sure to import it
11:35:30.560 from the correct place. So now in here
11:35:33.200 you have the duration of the
11:35:35.640 call. Now below this badge, let's go
11:35:38.560 ahead outside of this div, let's go
11:35:41.436 ahead and actually sorry inside of this
11:35:44.320 div below the badge, open a new div and
11:35:46.720 render the markdown.
11:35:50.640 Let's close the markdown. So, make sure
11:35:52.400 you have imported
11:35:54.040 markdown from React Markdown here. And
11:35:57.436 inside of here, render data
11:36:01.000 summary. So, let's go ahead and refresh.
11:36:03.596 In here, you can see that I have the
11:36:05.200 summary. The problem is it's not
11:36:07.040 formatted at all. So, in order to format
11:36:09.840 it, we have to go ahead and add
11:36:11.360 components prop here. Open an object and
11:36:14.320 let's simply add the elements. So this
11:36:16.640 is the H1 element text to Excel font
11:36:19.116 median and margin bottom of six. And
11:36:21.756 then I'm just going to copy from my
11:36:25.276 source code. The same is for H2
11:36:28.240 elements, H3 and H4. We are just
11:36:30.960 reducing the uh size of the fonts. You
11:36:34.320 can see it slowly changing now. Now
11:36:37.360 let's go ahead and let's add the
11:36:40.116 paragraph margin bottom of six and
11:36:42.560 leading relaxed. There we go. And then
11:36:45.276 you can go ahead and add more for
11:36:48.560 example unordered list or you can add
11:36:53.040 ordered list. You can then add a normal
11:36:56.960 normal list here. And I would also
11:37:00.080 suggest
11:37:01.240 adding
11:37:03.400 strong. I will also suggest
11:37:06.596 adding code and block quote. This way
11:37:09.840 you cover most of the things AI can
11:37:12.960 generate in markdown. So you can just
11:37:14.400 pause the screen. These are very simple
11:37:16.160 snippets, right? Uh and there we go. You
11:37:19.040 now have a nice overview summary
11:37:21.800 here. And I'm going to end the chapter
11:37:24.960 earlier now because I want to do the
11:37:26.880 transcript together with the AI chat
11:37:30.240 actually. So we only did the simple ones
11:37:32.400 now and we'll do these a bit more
11:37:34.160 complex ones in its own chapter. So
11:37:37.276 let's go ahead and mark this as
11:37:39.756 completed. Let's revert this. And
11:37:42.320 recording tab is completed. So, let's go
11:37:44.880 ahead and merge all of these changes.
11:37:47.436 I'm going to create a new branch. Uh 25
11:37:52.080 uh completed state I believe is the
11:37:54.560 chapter name. And once I have confirmed
11:37:59.040 I'm on a new branch, I'm going to stage
11:38:01.200 all of these changes. And I will add 25
11:38:04.160 completed state commit message. Click
11:38:07.680 commit and publish the branch. Once it's
11:38:10.480 published, let's go ahead and let's
11:38:12.960 review our pull request. I'm only
11:38:15.596 interested in any potential
11:38:18.840 issues. And here we have the summary.
11:38:21.436 So, this chapter was pretty simple. So,
11:38:24.080 not much going on here. We basically
11:38:25.840 added a completed meeting view with
11:38:28.800 summary, transcript, recording, and ask
11:38:31.200 AI tabs. And we added the markdown
11:38:33.840 rendered summary. And in here we have
11:38:36.720 one actionable comment and that is to
11:38:38.800 add turnary in case recording URL does
11:38:41.596 not exist which is a good idea
11:38:43.360 considering that it will uh disappear at
11:38:46.560 one point unless you use your own
11:38:48.320 storage as explained in the beginning of
11:38:50.320 the chapter. So you might consider doing
11:38:52.360 this. Let's go ahead and let's merge the
11:38:55.276 pull request. And once it is merged,
11:38:58.320 let's go back to our main branch and
11:39:00.560 let's synchronize the changes to ensure
11:39:02.720 everything is up to date. And in your
11:39:04.960 source control here in the graph, you
11:39:07.200 will now see 25 completed state.
11:39:10.160 Amazing, amazing job. And see you in the
11:39:12.400 next chapter.

Transliteration converts text from one script to another while preserving the original pronunciation. For example, ‘नमस्ते’ becomes ‘namaste’ in English, and ‘how are you’ can be written as ‘हाउ आर यू’ in Devanagari. This process ensures that the sound of the original text remains intact, even when written in a different script.

Transliteration is useful when you want to represent words phonetically across different writing systems, such as converting ‘मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ’ to ‘main office ja raha hun’ in English letters.

Translation, on the other hand, converts text from one language to another while preserving the meaning rather than pronunciation. For example, ‘मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ’ translates to ‘I am going to the office’ in English, changing both the script and the language while conveying the intended message.

Examples of Transliteration:
‘Good morning’ becomes ‘गुड मॉर्निंग’ in Hindi, where the pronunciation is preserved but the meaning is not translated.
‘सुप्रभात’ becomes ‘suprabhat’ in English.

Show 3 variants
model
"sarvam-m"
Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like sarvam-m.

temperature
double
Optional
>=0
<=2
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

top_p
double
Optional
>=0
<=1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

reasoning_effort
enum
Optional
Allowed values:
low
medium
high
max_tokens
integer
Optional

stream
boolean
Optional
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events.

stop
string or list of strings
Optional
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

n
integer
Optional
>=1
<=128
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

seed
integer
Optional
This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

frequency_penalty
double
Optional
>=-2
<=2
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model’s likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

presence_penalty
double
Optional
>=-2
<=2
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model’s likelihood to talk about new topics.

title: Authentication
slug: api-reference-docs/authentication
---

All API endpoints are authenticated using API Subscription Keys provided by Sarvam AI when you sign up. Include these keys in the header of each API request as follows:

```
api-subscription-key: <your-api-key>
```

### Obtaining Your API Subscription Key

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on the [Sarvam Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai)
2. **Generate Key**: When you sign up, an API key is generated for your account and shown in the dashboard.
3. **Organisation Key Management**: Create Organisational level keys is not currently supported and will be available soon.

#### Best Practices for API Key Management

1. **Keep Your Key Secret**: Never expose your API key in public repositories or client-side code.
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.
3. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your API usage on the Sarvam dashboard. You should be able to see the credits utilised & remaining

### Using the API Subscription Key

To authenticate your requests, include the `API-Subscription-Key` in the headers of your HTTP requests. Here's an example using SarvamAI SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock title="Python" active>

    ```python

    from sarvamai import SarvamAI

    client = SarvamAI(
        api_subscription_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    )

    response = client.text.translate(
        input="Hi, My Name is Vinayak.",
        source_language_code="auto",
        target_language_code="hi-IN",
        speaker_gender="Male"
    )

    print(response)
    ```

  </CodeBlock>

  <CodeBlock title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    import { SarvamAIClient } from "sarvamai";

const client = new SarvamAIClient({ apiSubscriptionKey: "YOUR_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY" });

await client.text.translate({
input: "input",
source_language_code: "auto",
target_language_code: "en-IN",

});

````
  </CodeBlock>

  <CodeBlock title="curl">
    ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.sarvam.ai/translate \

-H "api-subscription-key: <YOUR_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY>" \

title: Meta Prompt Guide
slug: api-reference-docs/metaprompt
---

## What is a Meta-Prompt?
A **meta-prompt** is a detailed instruction or template given to an AI, telling it how to think, act, or respond in specific scenarios. It sets the rules and context for the AI to follow consistently throughout the conversation.
## Why Use a Meta-Prompt?
1. **Consistency**  
Ensures the AI understands your goals and behaves in a reliable way.
2. **Clarity**  
Provides clear instructions, making the AI's responses more accurate and relevant.
3. **Efficiency**  
Saves time by reducing the need to explain the same context repeatedly.
4. **Customization**  
Adjusts the AI to fit specific tasks or workflows based on your needs.

---
Meta-prompts are especially helpful when working on complex tasks or integrating APIs, as they align the AI's responses with your requirements.
## **Meta-Prompt Usage Guide**

Follow these steps to effectively use the meta-prompt with your favorite AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar tools):  

#### **Step 1: Load the Meta-Prompt**  
Copy and paste the [meta-prompt](#meta-prompt) into the AI assistant’s input field. This will provide the AI with the necessary context to help you use Sarvam's APIs effectively.  

#### **Step 2: Provide Context for Your Use Case**  
In the next message, let the AI know that the meta-prompt should be taken as context for assisting you in building projects with Sarvam's APIs. You can use the following example:  
> "Hey, you have to take the above meta-prompt as your context and help me build things using Sarvam's API. I will provide the details in further prompts."

#### **Step 3: Share Your Specific Requirement**  
In subsequent messages, provide the specific details of the project or task you want to build. For example, if you want to create a translator app, you can say:  
> "I want to build a translator app that can translate English to Kannada. Please help me implement this using Sarvam's API."

---
With this implementation, you can input any English text, and the app will return the translated text in Kannada. Ensure you replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual Sarvam API subscription key.

By following this guide, you can seamlessly use the meta-prompt to leverage Sarvam's APIs for building various projects.

## Sarvam AI Meta Prompt 
**Note:-** This meta-prompt is designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini, not for human users. It provides context and instructions to guide the AI in assisting with tasks using Sarvam's API effectively.

```
You are an AI engineer designed to help users use Sarvam's APIs for their specific use case.

- Assume, the Bearer is stored in the environment variable named "SARVAM_API_KEY" and add the following comment to the implementation: "Get your Sarvam AI API subscription key here: https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/admin".
- Use the simplest solution possible (use single API's whenever possible, do not overcomplicate things).
- Answer "can't do" for tasks outside the scope of Sarvam AI.
- Choose built-in features over custom implementations whenever possible.
- You must use the Sarvam APIs for the implementation.
- Never decline an implementation because of its complexity.
- Generate production-ready code that follows exactly the requirements.
- Never use placeholder data.
- For every request to any of the Sarvam APIs, you must include the header -H "Accept: application/json" to specify that the response should be in JSON format.

### API Authentication Instructions

1. Add API Key to Headers:
    
    Include the header `api-subscription-key` with your API key in every request.
    
2. Request Structure:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    
    url = 'https://api.sarvam.ai/<api-endpoint>'
    headers = {'api-subscription-key': 'your-api-key'}
    payload = { 'key': 'value' }  # Replace with endpoint-specific data
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    
    
    
3. Replace Placeholders:
    - `<api-endpoint>`: Specific endpoint URL (e.g., `text-analytics`).
    - `'your-api-key'`: Your subscription key.
    - `'payload'`: Data required by the endpoint.
4. Send Request:
    
    Use the `requests.post` method to make authenticated calls.
    
5. Process Response:
    
    Parse the JSON response using `response.json()`.
    

For all APIs, ensure the payload matches the endpoint's requirements.

# Integration Guidelines

1. Ensure secure API communication using HTTPS to protect sensitive data.
2. Use API rate limiting to avoid overloading the server and ensure smooth performance.
3. Validate inputs and sanitize data before sending it to APIs to prevent injection attacks.
4. Always handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages for debugging.
5. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth or API keys to restrict access.
6. Log API requests and responses for tracking and troubleshooting issues.
7. Use versioning in API URLs to maintain backward compatibility with existing clients.
8. Follow consistent naming conventions for API endpoints and parameters to improve usability.
9. Optimize response times by caching frequently requested data where appropriate.
10. Regularly monitor and audit API usage to identify and mitigate any performance bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities.

# Tips for responding to user requests

1. Start by analyzing the task and identifying which API's should be used;
2. If multiple API's are required, outline the purpose of each API;
3. Write the code for calling each API as a separate function, and correctly handle any possible errors;
It is important to write reusable code, so that the user can reap the most benefits out of your response.

Note: Make sure to parse the response of each API correctly so that the data can be used effectively in your application. For example, if you're using the **Speech-to-Text API**, the transcript content should be extracted from the response like `transcript = response["data"]["transcript"]`. Similarly, if you are using the **Text-Analytics API**, you should extract the answers by accessing the response like `answers = response["data"]["answers"]`.

1. Write the complete code, including input loading, calling the API functions, and saving/printing results.
Ensure to use variables for required API keys. Be sure to properly set these variables before making any API requests.

title: Chat Completion API Using Sarvam Model
description: >-
  A step-by-step guide on how to use the Chat Completion API for generating text
  completions using Sarvam
---

# Overview

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the **Chat Completion API** for generating text completions using **Sarvam**. It includes instructions for installation, setting up the API key, and making API calls to generate completions.

## 0. Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```python
pip install requests
```

## 1. Import Required Libraries

This section imports the necessary Python libraries for making HTTP requests:

```python
import requests
```

- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the API.

## 2. Set Up the API Endpoint and Payload

To use the Sarvam API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Obtain your API key**: If you don't have an API key, sign up on the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/) to get one.
2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key.

```python
import os

# Replace with your actual API key
SARVAM_API_KEY = "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
SARVAM_API_URL = "https://api.sarvam.ai/v1/chat/completions"
```

### 2.1 Setting Up the API Headers and Payload

This section defines the headers and payload for the chat completion request:

```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

payload = {
    "model": "sarvam-m",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of India?"},
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 1.0,
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "n": 1,
}
```

## 3. Making the API Request

This section demonstrates how to make a request to the Chat Completion API and handle the response:

```python
def get_chat_completion(api_url, headers, payload):
    try:
        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            return result
        else:
            print("Request failed:", response.status_code, response.text)
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error making request: {e}")
        return None
```

### 3.1 Sending the Request and Processing the Response

```python
# Make the API request
response = get_chat_completion(SARVAM_API_URL, headers, payload)

# Process and display the response
if response:
    reply = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    print("Response:", reply)
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "id": "20250526_816b21fd-98c4-42c8-884e-086bd9d059e8",
  "model": "sarvam-m",
  "created": 1748266512,
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 19,
    "completion_tokens": 100,
    "total_tokens": 119
  },
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "finish_reason": "length",
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The capital of India is **New Delhi**. It serves as the seat of the central government, housing key institutions like the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's Office), Parliament, and the Supreme Court. While the British established Delhi as the capital in 1911, and it became the official capital of independent India in 1947, the city's history dates back much further, with roots in ancient civilizations and later rule by empires like the Delhi Sultanate."
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

  A step-by-step guide on how to use the Sarvam AI Language Identification API
  for language detection tasks.
---


### **Overview**

This notebook demonstrates how to use the **Language Identification API** to detect the language code and script code. Also, we will see how we can use language identification in translate and transliterate to auto-detect the source code and do the respective transformations.

2. [Authentication](#authentication)
3. [Basic Usage](#basic-usage)
4. [Auto Detection](#auto-detection)
5. [Error Handling](#error-handling)
6. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## **1️⃣ Setup & Installation**

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```python
!pip install requests
```

```python
import requests
```

## **2️⃣ Authentication**

To use the API, you need an API subscription key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Obtain your API key**: If you don’t have an API key, sign up on the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/) to get one.
2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

```python
SARVAM_API_KEY = "Your API Key"
```

## **3️⃣ Basic Usage**

The API requires a single key parameter:

✔ **`input`** – The text for which the language code and script code need to be detected.

🚫 **Note:** If the API is unable to detect the language or script, it will return `null` for both fields.

### **Response Parameters**

- **`language_code`** (String) – The detected language in BCP-47 format. Supported values:

  - `"en-IN"` (English - India)
  - `"en-US"` (English - United States)
  - `"bn-IN"` (Bengali - India)
  - `"gu-IN"` (Gujarati - India)
  - `"hi-IN"` (Hindi - India)
  - `"kn-IN"` (Kannada - India)
  - `"ml-IN"` (Malayalam - India)
  - `"mr-IN"` (Marathi - India)
  - `"od-IN"` (Odia - India)
  - `"pa-IN"` (Punjabi - India)
  - `"ta-IN"` (Tamil - India)
  - `"te-IN"` (Telugu - India)
  - `"ur-IN"` (Urdu - India)

- **`script_code`** (String) – The detected writing script in ISO-15924 format. Supported values:
  - `"Latn"` → Latin (Roman script)
  - `"Beng"` → Bengali script
  - `"Gujr"` → Gujarati script
  - `"Deva"` → Devanagari script
  - `"Knda"` → Kannada script
  - `"Mlym"` → Malayalam script
  - `"Orya"` → Odia script
  - `"Guru"` → Gurmukhi (Punjabi) script
  - `"Taml"` → Tamil script
  - `"Telu"` → Telugu script
  - `"Arab"` → Arabic script

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/text-lid"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
example_text="hey, what is your name?"
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": example_text
}

# Send API request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Process response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    language_code = data.get("language_code", "Language not detected")
    script_code = data.get("script_code", "Script not detected")

    print("\n=== Detection Results ===")
    print(f"Detected Language Code: {language_code}")
    print(f"Detected Script Code: {script_code}\n")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

```python
example_text="A'in jun aatinob'aal li maare ink'a' neketaw ru."
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": example_text
}

# Send API request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Process response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    language_code = data.get("language_code", "Language not detected")
    script_code = data.get("script_code", "Script not detected")

    print("\n=== Detection Results ===")
    print(f"Detected Language Code: {language_code}")
    print(f"Detected Script Code: {script_code}\n")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## **4️⃣ Auto Detection**

To enable automatic language detection, pass `"auto"` as the `source_language_code`. The API will return the transliterated/translated text along with the detected source language code.

🚫 **Note:** In case of detection failure, manually specify the `source_language_code` with one of the supported language codes.

If the API is unable to detect the language, the response will include an error message:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Unable to detect the language of the input text. Please explicitly pass the `source_language_code` parameter with a supported language.",
    "code": "unprocessable_entity_error"
  }
}
```

### Auto Detection in Transliterate

```python
import requests

# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/transliterate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "auto",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    transliterated_text = response_data.get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    source_language_code = response_data.get("source_language_code")

    print(f"✅ Transliteration Successful!\n🔤 Transliterated Text: {transliterated_text}")
    print(f"🌍 Detected Source Language: {source_language_code}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": "A'in jun aatinob'aal li maare ink'a' neketaw ru.",
    "source_language_code": "auto",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    transliterated_text = response_data.get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    source_language_code = response_data.get("source_language_code")

    print(f"✅ Transliteration Successful!\n🔤 Transliterated Text: {transliterated_text}")
    print(f"🌍 Detected Source Language: {source_language_code}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

### Auto Detection in Translate

```python
import requests

# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
import requests

payload = {
    "source_language_code": "auto",
    "target_language_code": "bn-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "classic-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है"
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    translated_text = response_data.get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    source_language_code = response_data.get("source_language_code", "Unknown")

    print(f"✅ Translation Successful!\n🌍 Detected Source Language: {source_language_code}")
    print(f"📝 Translated Text: {translated_text}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

## **5️⃣ Error Handling**

You may encounter these errors while using the API:

- **403 Forbidden** (`invalid_api_key_error`)

  - Cause: Invalid API key.
  - Solution: Use a valid API key from the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/).

- **429 Too Many Requests** (`insufficient_quota_error`)

  - Cause: Exceeded API quota.
  - Solution: Check your usage, upgrade if needed, or implement exponential backoff when retrying.

- **500 Internal Server Error** (`internal_server_error`)

  - Cause: Issue on our servers.
  - Solution: Try again later. If persistent, contact support.

- **400 Bad Request** (`invalid_request_error`)

  - Cause: Incorrect request formatting.
  - Solution: Verify your request structure and parameters.

- **422 Unprocessable Entity Request** (`unprocessable_entity_error`)
  - Cause: Unable to detect the language of the input text.
  - Solution: Explicitly pass the source_language_code parameter with a supported language.

```

```python
import requests
```

## 2. Authentication

To use the Sarvam API, you need an API subscription key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

```python
SARVAM_API_KEY = "YOUR_SARVAM_API_KEY"
```

## 3. Basic Usage

### 3.1. Read the Document

We have two sample documents under the `data` folder:

- `sample1.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in English.
- `sample2.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in Hindi.

```python
def read_file(file_path, lang_name):
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            # Read the first 5 lines
            lines = [next(file) for _ in range(5)]
            print(f"=== {lang_name} Text (First Few Lines) ===")
            print("".join(lines))  # Print first few lines

            # Read the remaining content
            remaining_text = file.read()

            # Combine all text
            full_doc = "".join(lines) + remaining_text

            # Count total characters
            total_chars = len(full_doc)
            print(f"\nTotal number of characters in {lang_name} file:", total_chars)

            return full_doc
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while reading {file_path}: {e}")
        return None
```

```python
# Read English and Hindi documents
english_doc = read_file("data/sample1.txt", "English")
hindi_doc = read_file("data/sample2.txt", "Hindi")
```

### 3.2. Split the text into chunks

Since the API has a restriction of 1000 characters per request, we need to split the text accordingly.

```python
def chunk_text(text, max_length=1000):
    """Splits text into chunks of at most max_length characters while preserving word boundaries."""
    chunks = []

    while len(text) > max_length:
        split_index = text.rfind(" ", 0, max_length)  # Find the last space within limit
        if split_index == -1:
            split_index = max_length  # No space found, force split at max_length

        chunks.append(text[:split_index].strip())  # Trim spaces before adding
        text = text[split_index:].lstrip()  # Remove leading spaces for the next chunk

    if text:
        chunks.append(text.strip())  # Add the last chunk

    return chunks
```

```python
# Split the text
english_text_chunks = chunk_text(english_doc)

# Display chunk info
print(f"Total Chunks: {len(english_text_chunks)}")
for i, chunk in enumerate(english_text_chunks[:3], 1):  # Show only first 3 chunks for preview
    print(f"\n=== Chunk {i} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ===\n{chunk}")
```

### 3.3. Setting up the API Endpoint

There are three main types of translations supported:

1. **English to Indic** - Translating from English to Indian languages
2. **Indic to English** - Converting Indian languages to English
3. **Indic to Indic** - Translating between Indian languages

#### Indic to English Translation

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "target_language_code": "en-IN",
        "speaker_gender": "Male",
        "mode": "classic-colloquial",
        "model": "mayura:v1",
        "enable_preprocessing": False,
        "input": chunk
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

#### Indic to Indic Translation

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "target_language_code": "bn-IN",
        "speaker_gender": "Male",
        "mode": "classic-colloquial",
        "model": "mayura:v1",
        "enable_preprocessing": False,
        "input": chunk
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

#### English to Indic Translation

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(english_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "source_language_code": "en-IN",
        "target_language_code": "pa-IN",
        "speaker_gender": "Male",
        "mode": "classic-colloquial",
        "model": "mayura:v1",
        "enable_preprocessing": False,
        "input": chunk
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

## 4. Translation Modes

### Translation Modes & Differences

1. **Formal** – Highly professional, uses pure Hindi (e.g., "कुल राशि", "देय है"). Suitable for official documents, legal papers, and corporate communication.
2. **Classic-Colloquial** – Balanced mix of Hindi & English, slightly informal (e.g., "कुल जोड़", "देना होगा"). Ideal for business emails, customer support, and semi-formal communication.
3. **Modern-Colloquial** – Hinglish, casual, and direct (e.g., "Invoice total", "due है", "contact करो"). Best for chatbots, social media, and casual conversations.

**Rule of Thumb:**

- Use Formal for official content
- Use Classic-Colloquial for general communication
- Use Modern-Colloquial for everyday conversations

```python
# To highlight the difference between the models lets use the below example.
full_text = (
    "The invoice total is $3,450.75, due by 15th March 2025. Contact us at support@example.com for queries. "
    "Order #987654321 was placed on 02/29/2024. Your tracking ID is TRK12345678."
)
```

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### 4.1. Classic Colloquial

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "classic-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 4.2. Formal

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "formal",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 4.3. Modern Colloquial

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## 5. Advanced Features

### 5.1. Speaker Gender

The translation model supports **Male** and **Female** speaker options, which impact the tone and style of the output.

#### Female

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

#### Male

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.2. Numerals Format Feature

The `numerals_format` parameter controls how numbers appear in the translation. It has two options:

1. **International (Default)** - Uses standard 0-9 numerals.
   Example: "मेरा phone number है: 9840950950."
   Best for universally understood content, technical documents, and modern usage.

2. **Native** - Uses language-specific numerals.
   Example: "मेरा phone number है: ९८४०९५०९५०."
   Ideal for traditional texts, cultural adaptation, and regional content.

**When to Use What?**

- Use **International** for wider readability and digital content
- Use **Native** for localized, heritage-focused, and print media content

#### Native

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "numerals_format": "native",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

#### International

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.3. Output Script Feature

The `output_script` parameter controls how the translated text is **transliterated**, i.e., how it appears in different scripts while keeping pronunciation intact.

#### Transliteration Options:

1. **Default (null)** – No transliteration applied.
   Example: "आपका Rs. 3000 का EMI pending है।"
   Best for modern, mixed-language content.

2. **Roman** – Converts the output into Romanized Hindi.
   Example: "aapka Rs. 3000 ka EMI pending hai."
   Ideal for users who can speak but not read native scripts.

3. **Fully-Native** – Uses formal native script transliteration.
   Example: "आपका रु. 3000 का ई.एम.ऐ. पेंडिंग है।"
   Best for official documents and structured writing.

4. **Spoken-Form-in-Native** – Uses native script but mimics spoken style.
   Example: "आपका थ्री थाउजेंड रूपीस का ईएमअइ पेंडिंग है।"
   Ideal for voice assistants, conversational AI, and informal speech.

**When to Use What?**

- **Default** – For natural, mixed-language modern writing
- **Roman** – For users unfamiliar with native scripts
- **Fully-Native** – For formal, structured translations
- **Spoken-Form-in-Native** – For casual speech and voice applications

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "output_script":"roman",
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "output_script":"spoken-form-in-native",
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "output_script":"fully-native",
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

title: Speech-to-Text Translation API Using Saaras Model
description: >-
  A step-by-step guide on how to use the STT-Translate API for translating audio
  files into text using Saaras
---

# Overview
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the **STT-Translate API** for translating audio files into text using **Saaras**. It includes instructions for installation, setting up the API key, uploading audio files, and translating audio using the API.

## 0. Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```python
pip install requests pandas pydub
```

## 1. Import Required Libraries

This section imports the necessary Python libraries for making HTTP requests, handling audio files, and managing data.

```python
import requests
import io
```

- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the API.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation (optional, depending on your use case).

## 2. Set Up the API Endpoint and Payload

To use the Saaras API, you need an API subscription key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Obtain your API key**: If you don't have an API key, sign up on the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/) to get one.
2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

```python
SARVAM_AI_API="YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY"
```

### 2.1 Setting Up the API Endpoint and Payload

This section defines the API endpoint and the payload for the translation request. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API key and desired parameters.

```python
# API endpoint for speech-to-text translation
api_url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text-translate"

# Headers containing the API subscription key
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_AI_API  # Replace with your API key
}

# Data payload for the translation request
data = {
    "model": "saaras:v2",  # Specify the model to be used
    "with_diarization": False  # Set to True for speaker diarization
}
```

## 3. Uploading Audio Files

To translate audio, you need to upload a `.wav` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your audio file**: Ensure your audio file is in `.wav` format. If your file is in a different format, you can use tools like `pydub` to convert it.
2. **Upload the file**: If you're using Google Colab, you can upload the file using the file uploader:

```python
from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()
audio_file_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]  # Get the name of the uploaded file
```

If you're working locally, ensure the file is in the same directory as your notebook and specify the file name:

```python
audio_file_path = "test.wav"  # Replace with your file name
```

## 4. Speech-to-Text Translation API

This section demonstrates how to use the *STT-Translate API* for translating audio files into text using *Saaras*. The API automatically identifies the language of the audio and supports long audio files by splitting them into chunks.

### 4.1. Splitting Audio into Chunks

The `split_audio` function splits an audio file into smaller chunks of a specified duration. This is useful for processing long audio files that exceed the API's input length limit.

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

def split_audio(audio_path, chunk_duration_ms):
    """
    Splits an audio file into smaller chunks of specified duration.

    Args:
        audio_path (str): Path to the audio file to be split.
        chunk_duration_ms (int): Duration of each chunk in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        list: A list of AudioSegment objects representing the audio chunks.
    """
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)  # Load the audio file
    chunks = []
    if len(audio) > chunk_duration_ms:
        # Split the audio into chunks of the specified duration
        for i in range(0, len(audio), chunk_duration_ms):
            chunks.append(audio[i:i + chunk_duration_ms])
    else:
        # If the audio is shorter than the chunk duration, use the entire audio
        chunks.append(audio)
    return chunks
```

### 4.2. Translating Audio

The `translate_audio` function translates audio chunks using the Saaras API. It handles the API request for each chunk and collates the results.

```python
def translate_audio(audio_file_path, api_url, headers, data, chunk_duration_ms=5*60*1000):
    """
    Translates audio into text with optional diarization and timestamps.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): Path to the audio file.
        api_url (str): API endpoint URL for Speech-to-Text and Translate.
        headers (dict): Headers for API authentication.
        data (dict): Payload containing model and other options like diarization.
        chunk_duration_ms (int): Duration of each audio chunk in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        dict: Collated response containing the transcript and word-level timestamps.
    """
    # Split the audio into chunks
    chunks = split_audio(audio_file_path, chunk_duration_ms)
    responses = []

    # Process each chunk
    for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        # Export the chunk to a BytesIO object (in-memory binary stream)
        chunk_buffer = io.BytesIO()
        chunk.export(chunk_buffer, format="wav")
        chunk_buffer.seek(0)  # Reset the pointer to the start of the stream

        # Prepare the file for the API request
        files = {'file': ('audiofile.wav', chunk_buffer, 'audio/wav')}

        try:
            # Make the POST request to the API
            response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, files=files, data=data)
            if response.status_code == 200 or response.status_code == 201:
                print(f"Chunk {idx} POST Request Successful!")
                response_data = response.json()
                transcript = response_data.get("transcript", "")
                responses.append({"transcript": transcript})
            else:
                # Handle failed requests
                print(f"Chunk {idx} POST Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
                print("Response:", response.text)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any exceptions during the request
            print(f"Error processing chunk {idx}: {e}")
        finally:
            # Ensure the buffer is closed after processing
            chunk_buffer.close()

    # Collate the transcriptions from all chunks
    collated_transcript = " ".join([resp["transcript"] for resp in responses])
    collated_response = {
        "transcript": collated_transcript,
        "language": response_data.get("language_code")
    }
    return collated_response
```

### 4.3 Translating the Audio

This section calls the `translate_audio` function to translate the audio file. Replace `audio_file_path` with the path to your audio file.

```python
# Path to the audio file to be translated
# audio_file_path = "test.wav"  # Replace with your file path

# Translate the audio
translation = translate_audio(audio_file_path, api_url, headers, data)

# Display the translation results
translation
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "transcript": "There are many ethical stories in English that are beneficial for children. They activate your child's imagination, entertain them, and make them happy. Short ethical stories are ideal to keep them focused and focused throughout the story.",
  "language": "hi-IN"
}
```

    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)  # Load the audio file
    chunks = []
    if len(audio) > chunk_duration_ms:
        # Split the audio into chunks of the specified duration
        for i in range(0, len(audio), chunk_duration_ms):
            chunks.append(audio[i:i + chunk_duration_ms])
    else:
        # If the audio is shorter than the chunk duration, use the entire audio
        chunks.append(audio)
    return chunks
```

## 5. Define the `transcribe_audio_chunks` Function

This function transcribes audio chunks using the Saaras API. It handles the API request for each chunk and collates the results.

```python
def transcribe_audio_chunks(audio_file_path, api_url, headers, data, chunk_duration_ms=5*60*1000):
    """
    Transcribes audio chunks using the Speech-to-Text API.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): Path to the audio file.
        api_url (str): The API endpoint URL for Speech-to-Text.
        headers (dict): Headers containing authentication information.
        data (dict): Data payload for the transcription API.
        chunk_duration_ms (int): Duration of each audio chunk in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        dict: Collated response containing the transcript.
    """
    # Split the audio into chunks
    chunks = split_audio(audio_file_path, chunk_duration_ms)
    responses = []  # List to store the transcription results

    # Process each chunk
    for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        # Export the chunk to a BytesIO object (in-memory binary stream)
        chunk_buffer = io.BytesIO()
        chunk.export(chunk_buffer, format="wav")
        chunk_buffer.seek(0)  # Reset the pointer to the start of the stream

        # Prepare the file for the API request
        files = {'file': ('audiofile.wav', chunk_buffer, 'audio/wav')}

        try:
            # Make the POST request to the API
            response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, files=files, data=data)
            if response.status_code == 200 or response.status_code == 201:
                print(f"Chunk {idx} POST Request Successful!")
                response_data = response.json()
                transcript = response_data.get("transcript", "")
                responses.append({"transcript": transcript})
            else:
                # Handle failed requests
                print(f"Chunk {idx} POST Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
                print("Response:", response.text)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any exceptions during the request
            print(f"Error processing chunk {idx}: {e}")
        finally:
            # Ensure the buffer is closed after processing
            chunk_buffer.close()

    # Collate the transcriptions from all chunks
    collated_responses = {"collated_transcript": " ".join([i["transcript"] for i in responses])}
    return collated_responses
```

## 6. Transcribe the Audio

This section calls the `transcribe_audio_chunks` function to transcribe the audio file. Replace `audio_file_path` with the path to your audio file.

```python
# Path to the audio file to be transcribed
# audio_file_path = "test.wav"  # Replace with your file path

# Transcribe the audio
transcriptions = transcribe_audio_chunks(audio_file_path, api_url, headers, data)

# Display the transcription results
transcriptions
```

## 6. Explanation of the Output

The output of the `transcribe_audio_chunks` function is a dictionary containing the collated transcript of the entire audio file. If the audio was split into multiple chunks, the transcripts from all chunks are combined into a single string.

Example output:

```json
{
    "collated_transcript": "This is the transcribed text from the audio file."
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to use the **STT API** for speech-to-text transcription. By following the steps, you can transcribe audio files, even long ones, by splitting them into smaller chunks. The process involves installing required libraries, setting up your API key, uploading audio, and transcribing it using the provided functions.

Note: Transliteration between Indic languages (e.g., Hindi → Bengali) is not supported.

## 4. Basic Usage

### 4.1. Read the Document

We have two sample documents under the `data` folder:

- `sample1.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in English.
- `sample2.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in Hindi.

```python
def read_file(file_path, lang_name):
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            # Read the first 5 lines
            lines = [next(file) for _ in range(5)]
            print(f"=== {lang_name} Text (First Few Lines) ===")
            print("".join(lines))  # Print first few lines

            # Read the remaining content
            remaining_text = file.read()

            # Combine all text
            full_doc = "".join(lines) + remaining_text

            # Count total characters
            total_chars = len(full_doc)
            print(f"\nTotal number of characters in {lang_name} file:", total_chars)

            return full_doc
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while reading {file_path}: {e}")
        return None
```

```python
# Read English and Hindi documents
english_doc = read_file("data/sample1.txt", "English")
hindi_doc = read_file("data/sample2.txt", "Hindi")
```

### 4.2. Split the text into chunks

Since the API has a restriction of 1000 characters per request, we need to split the text accordingly.

```python
def chunk_text(text, max_length=1000):
    """Splits text into chunks of at most max_length characters while preserving word boundaries."""
    chunks = []

    while len(text) > max_length:
        split_index = text.rfind(" ", 0, max_length)  # Find the last space within limit
        if split_index == -1:
            split_index = max_length  # No space found, force split at max_length

        chunks.append(text[:split_index].strip())  # Trim spaces before adding
        text = text[split_index:].lstrip()  # Remove leading spaces for the next chunk

    if text:
        chunks.append(text.strip())  # Add the last chunk

    return chunks
```

```python
# Split the text
english_text_chunks = chunk_text(english_doc)

# Display chunk info
print(f"Total Chunks: {len(english_text_chunks)}")
for i, chunk in enumerate(english_text_chunks[:3], 1):  # Show only first 3 chunks for preview
    print(f"\n=== Chunk {i} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ===\n{chunk}")
```

```python
# Split the text
hindi_text_chunks = chunk_text(english_doc)

# Display chunk info
print(f"Total Chunks: {len(hindi_text_chunks)}")
for i, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks[:3], 1):  # Show only first 3 chunks for preview
    print(f"\n=== Chunk {i} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ===\n{chunk}")
```

### 4.3. Setting up the API Endpoint

```python
import requests

# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/transliterate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "input": chunk,
        "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "spoken_form": True,
        "numerals_format": "international"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

## 5. Experimenting with Different Options

We currently have three different transliteration models:

### 5.1. Romanization (Indic → Latin Script)

- Converts Indic scripts to Roman script (English alphabet).
- Example: `मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ` → `main office ja raha hun`
- Parameters:
  - `source_language_code = "hi-IN"`
  - `target_language_code = "en-IN"`

```python
# Define the payload for Romanization (Hindi to Latin script)
payload = {
    "input": "मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "en-IN",
    "spoken_form": True
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.2. Conversion to Indic Scripts

- Converts text into an Indic script from various sources:

  - **Code-mixed text**

    - Example: `मैं office जा रहा हूँ` → `मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ`
    - Parameters:
      - `source_language_code = "hi-IN"`
      - `target_language_code = "hi-IN"`

  - **Romanized text**

    - Example: `main office ja raha hun` → `मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ`
    - Parameters:
      - `source_language_code = "hi-IN"`
      - `target_language_code = "hi-IN"`

  - **English text**
    - Example: `I am going to office` → `आइ ऍम गोइंग टू ऑफिस`
    - Parameters:
      - `source_language_code = "en-IN"`
      - `target_language_code = "hi-IN"`

```python
payload = {
    "input": "main office ja raha hun",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.3. Spoken Indic Form

- Converts written text into a more natural spoken form.
- Example: `मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है` → `मुझे कल सुबह साढ़े नौ बजे अपॉइंटमेंट है`

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## 6. Advanced Features

- **`numerals_format`** – Choose between **international (0-9)** or **native (१-९)** numbers.
- **`spoken_form_numerals_language`** – Choose whether numbers should be spoken in **English** or the **native language**.

### 6.1. Numerals Format

`numerals_format` is an optional parameter with two options:

- **`international`** (default): Uses regular numerals (0-9).
- **`native`**: Uses language-specific native numerals.

#### Example:

- If `international` format is selected → `मेरा phone number है: 9840950950`.
- If `native` format is selected → `मेरा phone number है: ९८४०९५०९५०`.

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
    "numerals_format": "native"
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 6.2. Spoken Form Numerals Language

`spoken_form_numerals_language` is an optional parameter with two options and only works when `spoken_form` is **true**:

- **`english`**: Numbers in the text will be spoken in **English**.
- **`native (default)`**: Numbers in the text will be spoken in the **native language**.

#### Example:

**Input:** `"मेरे पास ₹200 है"`

- If `english` format is selected → `"मेरे पास टू हन्डर्ड रूपीस है"`.
- If `native` format is selected → `"मेरे पास दो सौ रुपये है"`.

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
    "spoken_form_numerals_language": "english"
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## 7. Error Handling

You may encounter these errors while using the API:

- **403 Forbidden** (`invalid_api_key_error`)

  - Cause: Invalid API key.
  - Solution: Use a valid API key from the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/).

- **429 Too Many Requests** (`insufficient_quota_error`)

  - Cause: Exceeded API quota.
  - Solution: Check your usage, upgrade if needed, or implement exponential backoff when retrying.

```bash
mkdir SpotlightApp && cd SpotlightApp
npx create-d-expo-app@latest .
````

### 2. Clean Default Boilerplate

```bash
npm run reset-project
# Confirm to move files to /app-example, then delete it
```

---

## 🔄 File Structure Overview

```
/SpotlightApp
├── app/                  # All screens & routing logic
├── assets/               # Images & fonts
├── constants/theme.ts    # Color, spacing config
├── styles/               # Modular stylesheets
└── ...
```

---

## 🧪 Run the App

### Option 1: Use Physical Device

* Install Expo Go from App Store/Play Store
* Run: `npx expo start` and scan QR

### Option 2: Use Simulator

* iOS: press `i` for iOS Simulator
* Android: press `a` (requires Android Studio)

---

## 🏗️ Core App Functionality

### 🔹 Screens

* Home (Feed)
* Bookmarks
* Create Post
* Notifications
* Profile

### 🔹 Components

* `Text`, `View`, `Image`, `FlatList`, `TouchableOpacity`, `Pressable`, etc.

---

## 🔀 Navigation Setup

### 1. Tab Navigator

* Create `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
* Define screens using `<Tabs.Screen name="..." />`
* Customize icons using `Ionicons`
* Apply theming: `tabBarActiveTintColor`, `tabBarStyle`

### 2. Stack Navigator

* Controlled via `app/_layout.tsx`
* Used for navigation between screens like `Login → Tabs`, `Tabs → Notifications`

---

## 🎨 Styling Setup

### Centralized Theme

Create `constants/theme.ts`:

```ts
export const COLORS = {
  primary: "#22c55e",
  secondary: "#64748b",
  background: "#000000",
  white: "#ffffff",
  ...
};
```

### StyleSheet Example

```tsx
import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";

export default StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    backgroundColor: COLORS.background,
  },
});
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication (Clerk)

### 1. Sign Up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)

### 2. Configure:

* API Keys
* Allowed redirect URIs
* Social Auth (Google)

### 3. Integrate Clerk

* Install Clerk SDK
* Wrap root app with ClerkProvider
* Add `SignIn`, `SignUp`, and session management

---

## 🗃️ Backend (Convex)

### 1. Set Up Convex

* Sign up at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
* Create a project
* Get Convex project config & install SDK

### 2. Define DB Schema

```ts
// convex/schema.ts
export default defineSchema({
  posts: defineTable({
    caption: v.string(),
    image: v.string(),
    likes: v.array(v.string()),
    ...
  }),
});
```

### 3. Backend Functions

```ts
// convex/functions/post.ts
export const createPost = mutation({
  args: { ... },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.insert("posts", args);
  },
});
```

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

| Concept              | Implementation Detail                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Safe Area Views      | `SafeAreaProvider` and `SafeAreaView`                  |
| Theming              | Centralized in `theme.ts`, imported in components      |
| Icons                | `@expo/vector-icons`, primarily `Ionicons` used        |
| Navigation Types     | Tab + Stack navigators using Expo Router               |
| Auth & DB Separation | Clerk for auth, Convex for DB and serverless functions |
| Styling Convention   | Modular `styles/ComponentName.styles.ts` format        |

---

## 📦 Bonus Tips

* Use `TouchableOpacity` for simple button feedback
* Separate styles into their own files for each screen
* Avoid large inline styles; use `StyleSheet.create()`
* Use `require(...)` for local images, `uri:` for remote

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

You now have:

* A production-ready boilerplate for React Native
* Auth + DB backend setup via Clerk and Convex
* Responsive, real-time mobile UI
* Clean architecture and modular design

# The Ultimate React Native Course | Build Your First Mobile App in 2025
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/wbj-DuaL748

00:00:00.199 so you might not believe it but this is
00:00:02.320 the actual mobile application that we're
00:00:04.640 going to build with react native in this
00:00:07.040 one single tutorial it works both on a
00:00:09.800 simulator and on your IOS and Android
00:00:12.920 devices in this application everything
00:00:15.440 works in real time for example when
00:00:18.119 someone likes a post every user can see
00:00:21.199 the update immediately and what you have
00:00:23.480 just witnessed was a clip from the end
00:00:25.960 of this tutorial where we test out our
00:00:28.359 entire application everything that you
00:00:30.400 know about react can be used to build
00:00:33.200 this mobile application thanks to react
00:00:35.920 native and in this video I'll assume you
00:00:38.520 have no experience with mobile
00:00:40.520 development and react native so
00:00:42.800 basically I'll take you from scratch and
00:00:45.239 I'll teach you 99% of the things that
00:00:47.800 you would need to build a real world
00:00:50.280 mobile application and specifically
00:00:52.800 using react native and Expo so let me
00:00:55.800 give you a complete walk through of the
00:00:57.800 end result and then we'll talk about the
00:01:00.239 text stack and what you'll learn from
00:01:02.480 this video so this is a social media
00:01:04.920 application that is called Spotlight and
00:01:07.560 it has seven different screens which are
00:01:10.360 authentication home bookmarks post
00:01:13.040 creation notifications our own profile
00:01:16.159 and the profiles of other users
00:01:18.520 everything starts with the
00:01:19.880 authentication screen we have Google
00:01:21.960 authentication implemented that works
00:01:24.119 flawlessly once we are logged in we will
00:01:26.640 be navigated to the home screen where we
00:01:29.400 have stories and posts we can like posts
00:01:33.079 add a comment and add a bookmark we can
00:01:36.079 see all of our past bookmarks on this
00:01:38.880 screen and if we are the owner of the
00:01:41.200 posts we are able to delete them in the
00:01:44.040 create screen we can select an image
00:01:46.719 from our device add a caption and share
00:01:49.799 it with everyone there will be three
00:01:51.719 types of notifications which are like
00:01:54.479 follow and comment we will be able to
00:01:57.079 see the post details as well as the
00:01:59.560 comment M itself in the profile screen
00:02:02.240 we can see our stats and posts and we
00:02:05.200 can edit our own profile with this
00:02:07.399 really cool animated model that slides
00:02:09.720 in from the bottom of the screen and we
00:02:11.959 can visit other user profiles where we
00:02:14.440 can follow and unfollow them and in the
00:02:17.040 homepage we will have refresh
00:02:18.959 functionality as well as a logout button
00:02:21.879 that will navigate us back to the
00:02:24.000 authentication so this is the entire
00:02:26.040 application that we're going to build
00:02:27.599 today and as you can tell there is a lot
00:02:29.920 to cover in this one tutorial so you
00:02:32.280 will learn how to use every fundamental
00:02:34.720 component that you should know in react
00:02:36.840 native such as view text image link
00:02:39.920 scroll view flat list and the rest is on
00:02:42.159 the screen on top of all these you will
00:02:44.560 learn about special files and folders
00:02:47.440 like app tabs and layout and you will
00:02:50.239 learn some Concepts and terms that you
00:02:52.680 should know in Mobile development such
00:02:55.080 as splash screen safe area view Tab and
00:02:58.400 stack Navigators while building this
00:03:00.720 application we are going to talk about
00:03:02.519 the performance and we will see how to
00:03:05.040 improve it as well we are going to learn
00:03:07.120 how to use our own phones like the one
00:03:09.599 that we have in the logo we will even
00:03:11.799 change the default app icon and I'm
00:03:14.360 going to provide some additional
00:03:16.000 resources that you should keep in mind
00:03:18.159 while building your next mobile
00:03:20.120 applications with react native now the
00:03:22.640 most important question is do you really
00:03:24.799 need a MacBook to be able to follow
00:03:27.000 along with this video absolutely not any
00:03:29.799 laptop that is connected to the internet
00:03:32.120 should be fine and this is all thanks to
00:03:34.599 Expo which is a framework and a platform
00:03:37.599 that is built on top of react native we
00:03:39.840 are going to talk more about it later in
00:03:41.720 the video but basically it allows us to
00:03:44.519 scan a QR code and test out the
00:03:47.280 application on our physical device when
00:03:50.120 it comes to the prerequisites if you
00:03:52.280 know the basics of react you should be
00:03:54.439 able to follow along from start to end
00:03:57.040 without any issues and our text tag will
00:03:59.879 be react native with Expo convex for our
00:04:03.480 entire back end and clerk for
00:04:05.560 authentication along the way you will
00:04:07.760 learn some really interesting Concepts
00:04:09.840 to talk about in your interviews so
00:04:12.680 overall this is the kind of tutorial
00:04:14.799 that I wish I had when I first started
00:04:17.120 with react native and I say this from
00:04:19.560 the bottom of my heart now I can talk
00:04:21.959 about this tutorial for the next 20
00:04:23.919 minutes but I think I'll just leave it
00:04:26.000 here and see you inside just before we
00:04:28.919 get into the video video if you would
00:04:30.560 like to support my work I have a udmi
00:04:33.160 course with over 100 hours of content
00:04:36.199 for the cheapest price that you can ever
00:04:38.680 get it's only onetime payment for
00:04:41.360 Lifetime access you can find the
00:04:43.360 discount Link in the description and the
00:04:45.680 source code of this project and future
00:04:48.199 projects will be there you can watch
00:04:50.320 this entire tutorial in UD me as well
00:04:52.800 without any ads thanks for watching and
00:04:55.280 let's get into it so before we start
00:04:57.680 writing any code I have prepared some
00:05:00.000 notes that we can take a look at and
00:05:02.320 once we are done with it we'll go ahead
00:05:04.199 and actually start coding you can get
00:05:06.639 these notes from the link in the
00:05:08.479 description it'll be completely free at
00:05:11.039 the moment it is private but while
00:05:13.000 you're watching this video it's going to
00:05:14.880 be public so let's start with the
00:05:17.320 question what is react native in the
00:05:19.759 first place so it is a framework that
00:05:22.639 allows you to build mobile applications
00:05:25.199 using react you can either use
00:05:27.520 JavaScript or typescript and this video
00:05:30.280 we'll be using typescript so all in all
00:05:32.720 it is a framework that allows you to
00:05:34.560 build mobile applications still using
00:05:37.639 react and there is a really common
00:05:40.319 keyword or a term called crossplatform
00:05:44.199 development which means writing code
00:05:46.800 once that can run on multiple platforms
00:05:50.560 and this is exactly what react native
00:05:52.919 allows us to do so it is a crossplatform
00:05:55.800 framework because we can write one
00:05:58.400 codebase in Java script and we can
00:06:01.000 deploy it to both IOS and Android now
00:06:04.720 this is really convenient and pretty
00:06:06.639 cool when you compare it to back in the
00:06:09.400 old days so just think about it for a
00:06:12.120 second back in the old days if you
00:06:14.199 wanted to build a mobile application you
00:06:16.919 actually had to build it twice one for
00:06:20.160 iOS one for App Store right and one for
00:06:24.080 play store which is for Android and you
00:06:27.160 had to learn two different programming
00:06:29.160 languages right for iOS you had to learn
00:06:32.120 Swift and for Android you had to learn
00:06:35.080 cotland and before Swift has been
00:06:38.120 introduced you had to use Objective C
00:06:40.840 which was a lot more harder than Swift
00:06:44.080 and before the cin you had to learn Java
00:06:48.080 and like there are
00:06:50.360 still um some drawbacks like for uh
00:06:54.440 Apple development you had to learn you
00:06:56.919 had to have a Macbook which is pretty
00:06:59.000 expensive to get and for the Android you
00:07:02.080 had to learn Android SDK and its
00:07:04.319 Frameworks so it was really a
00:07:06.400 complicated process and if you were a
00:07:09.039 company founder that means you need to
00:07:11.319 hire two different teams right one would
00:07:14.400 be building the iOS application and the
00:07:17.599 other one would be building the exact
00:07:19.280 same application but for Android so it
00:07:21.879 was really a messy process but thanks to
00:07:24.919 react native we can just write one code
00:07:27.599 base right and then we can deploy it to
00:07:30.240 both IOS and Android so I hope this
00:07:33.039 gives you a little bit more insights
00:07:35.319 into react native but hey react native
00:07:38.840 by itself is not enough and this is a
00:07:41.360 screenshot that I took from the
00:07:43.360 documentation so if you visit
00:07:45.199 reactnative dodev and get started with
00:07:47.960 it you're going to see that they tell
00:07:49.960 you we believe that the best way to
00:07:52.599 experience react native is through a
00:07:55.120 framework and their recommendation is
00:07:58.000 Expo this is what will be using in this
00:08:00.280 video as well so it is like a toolbox
00:08:03.120 with all the necessary apis that lets
00:08:06.000 you to build production ready
00:08:08.680 applications okay so now that we know
00:08:10.919 react native is not enough we need to
00:08:12.599 use a framework like Expo this is going
00:08:15.280 to be our goto framework when using
00:08:18.319 react native but please don't get
00:08:20.919 confused react native and Expo are not
00:08:24.240 the same thing so like Expo is built on
00:08:27.680 top of react native when you are
00:08:29.879 building an application with expo at the
00:08:32.519 end of the day you're still writing
00:08:34.679 react native but it just has a lot more
00:08:37.559 optimizations on top of it and you are
00:08:40.320 getting a lot of other tools that you
00:08:42.679 would need and and like it's pretty
00:08:45.720 convenient so you can think of it like
00:08:48.080 react and nextjs in web development when
00:08:51.120 you are building an application with
00:08:52.800 nextjs you're still actually writing
00:08:55.880 react code but on top of it you have
00:08:58.200 some features like like server actions
00:09:01.320 um API routes things like that right
00:09:03.760 server components so on and so forth so
00:09:06.399 it is the exact same situation that we
00:09:08.320 have right here and now let's take a
00:09:11.160 look at some comparisons that we have
00:09:13.360 between react and react native so I have
00:09:16.360 prepared this list to prove you that
00:09:18.560 react native is not actually different
00:09:20.640 than react as the name suggests it is
00:09:23.440 still react but it just has a bit more
00:09:26.800 Concepts and syntax differences on top
00:09:29.480 of it so let's go through this list
00:09:31.560 pretty quickly the point of this thing
00:09:34.320 is just to get you you know just just to
00:09:36.800 give you some idea so in react web if
00:09:39.959 you wanted to build a component you
00:09:41.959 would use things like ative H1 ptag so
00:09:45.839 on and so forth if you wanted to give
00:09:47.839 some Styles you would use a class name
00:09:50.079 field right and in react native it is
00:09:52.680 not actually that different instead of
00:09:55.000 using a you would use View and for any
00:09:58.040 text you can imagine like H1 H6 like
00:10:01.920 ptag H3 spin anything you would use text
00:10:06.399 so you would wrap your entire text in a
00:10:10.279 text component which is coming from
00:10:12.399 react native okay I hope that makes
00:10:15.079 sense we don't really have class name in
00:10:17.399 react native instead we would use style
00:10:20.399 and this is something that we're going
00:10:21.839 to get next so styling in react uh web
00:10:26.320 you would give a class name and then you
00:10:28.440 would uh let's say you would prepare
00:10:30.920 these classes in your CSS files and you
00:10:33.720 would give the styling like we have a
00:10:36.200 card and profile image classes and these
00:10:39.279 are the styles that it
00:10:41.519 has and then when it comes to the react
00:10:43.959 native we are actually getting a
00:10:46.120 component called stylesheet from react
00:10:48.880 native and here we create our Styles so
00:10:52.360 we have card and with these Styles and
00:10:55.680 then the profile image and under this
00:10:58.040 style we say styles. card so that means
00:11:01.320 this view will get all these styling
00:11:03.839 that you see here so it is like CSS injs
00:11:07.680 right and we're going to see all these
00:11:10.160 later in the video as well and when it
00:11:12.600 comes to event handling in react web
00:11:15.040 development we have on click on Mouse
00:11:17.519 over so on and so forth and it's almost
00:11:20.079 the same thing in react native but
00:11:22.560 instead of on click we have on press
00:11:25.040 because as you can imagine it is a
00:11:26.959 mobile phone uh so the name
00:11:30.240 uh like name makes sense right on press
00:11:33.079 on long press on double tab things like
00:11:36.560 that right and instead of a button
00:11:39.279 component we have things like touchable
00:11:42.200 opacity or pressable these are the
00:11:45.000 components that we're going to see later
00:11:46.959 in the
00:11:47.959 video okay let's just speed up a bit we
00:11:50.959 have lists in react web development like
00:11:54.000 we do items. map for each item we would
00:11:57.760 return something so is really similar
00:12:00.440 what we have here instead we have a
00:12:02.839 component called Flat list and here we
00:12:05.560 say this is the data that we'll like to
00:12:08.120 map through and for each item render
00:12:11.279 this function so we basically get the
00:12:14.839 item and for every single item we'll
00:12:17.639 like to return this part it might look
00:12:20.760 complicated but it's actually pretty
00:12:22.519 simple that we're going to see in the
00:12:24.800 incoming sections then we have forms so
00:12:28.079 instead of using an input element we can
00:12:30.440 use things like text input and instead
00:12:33.560 of onsubmit we can use on press on the
00:12:36.839 button okay I hope this gives you a
00:12:39.959 little bit more confidence in your react
00:12:42.279 native Journey right it is not really
00:12:45.240 that different than react okay so with
00:12:49.120 this in mind I have an empty folder let
00:12:52.440 me just go ahead and open this up in my
00:12:56.079 desktop okay there we go I actually have
00:12:58.160 it I have created an empty folder on my
00:13:01.279 desktop I have called this as Spotlight
00:13:04.040 app you can call this anything just open
00:13:06.600 it up in vs code then we would like to
00:13:09.040 open up our terminal and start an expo
00:13:12.279 application so this is the command that
00:13:14.519 you would type npx create D Expo app at
00:13:20.279 latest and I would like to initialize
00:13:22.880 this under the current folder so I'll go
00:13:25.519 ahead and just put dot at the
00:13:27.800 end and let me show you the actual
00:13:31.240 documentation that I got this from so if
00:13:34.440 you visit expo. Dev create the
00:13:37.079 documentation this is the Quick Start
00:13:39.560 command that you can get okay let's go
00:13:42.519 ahead and run
00:13:44.079 this this might ask you a question just
00:13:47.160 press why and then press
00:13:49.600 enter so in the like in your very first
00:13:52.600 time it might ask you that since this is
00:13:55.480 my like not the first time I didn't get
00:13:57.920 that question and let's wait for this to
00:14:00.480 complete and in the next section we're
00:14:02.880 going to talk about this code
00:14:05.600 base okay so installation has just been
00:14:08.880 completed in my terminal I can see it
00:14:11.560 says your project is ready and we would
00:14:14.399 like to start it so I'll just clear up
00:14:16.600 my terminal and before we start this
00:14:19.040 application I would like to mention that
00:14:21.240 we have a bunch of different files like
00:14:23.639 hooks components constants Etc we're
00:14:26.800 going to actually delete all of them and
00:14:29.199 will start from scratch because I can
00:14:31.199 imagine this might look really really
00:14:33.320 complicated for a beginner but as I said
00:14:36.680 we will actually reset this project in a
00:14:39.160 second but first I need to mention if
00:14:41.880 you want to follow along with this video
00:14:44.120 currently you have two different options
00:14:46.839 so you would either install the expoo
00:14:49.880 application in your actual physical
00:14:52.600 phone so you can visit app store if
00:14:55.279 you're using iPhone or if you have an
00:14:57.560 Android device you you can visit Google
00:15:00.160 Play store and just get the xoo
00:15:03.320 application and then by using this we
00:15:06.519 can test out our application or you can
00:15:10.440 use a simulator if you are on Windows
00:15:13.320 you would get Android studio and if you
00:15:15.759 are on Mac you would get X code now
00:15:19.040 since I am teaching you guys I have to
00:15:21.079 show this simulator on the screen so I
00:15:24.160 can just test this out show you the end
00:15:26.399 result in real time I'll be using a
00:15:28.519 similar
00:15:29.680 but if you ask me this is a lot more
00:15:31.800 harder to get into like why is it is
00:15:35.639 just because it'll take longer to
00:15:37.519 install any of these uh simulators will
00:15:41.199 be more than 10 GB but if you install
00:15:44.560 xoo on your phone it'll take less than 1
00:15:47.360 minute and you can just see the end
00:15:49.880 result in your actual phone and let's
00:15:52.399 see how we can start our application in
00:15:55.240 our
00:15:56.360 phone so I'll just visit vs code and
00:15:59.440 I'll say MPX Expo and just run this
00:16:03.639 command okay so if you are using your
00:16:06.680 physical phone you need to scan this QR
00:16:09.199 code in your actual terminal and you
00:16:11.959 need to connect to the same Wi-Fi like
00:16:15.839 your uh computer and your phone should
00:16:18.160 be connected to the same Wi-Fi okay and
00:16:21.839 then since I am since I'm going to be
00:16:24.279 running this in the iOS simulator I'll
00:16:26.759 just press I if you are on Windows you
00:16:29.160 can press a and you should have the
00:16:31.560 Android simulator up and running so I
00:16:34.839 can realize like I know we are going
00:16:37.040 really slowly but I just need to make
00:16:39.079 sure that everyone is in the same page
00:16:41.959 so I'll just press I hopefully this will
00:16:44.880 go ahead start the Expo application on
00:16:47.920 this simulator and here we go this is
00:16:51.319 the boilerplate application that we got
00:16:53.959 from the Expo team so this is what they
00:16:56.480 give us this is the code base and this
00:16:58.319 is the op put and let me just put them
00:17:01.440 side by side just like this okay now
00:17:04.760 here it says go into the app tabs index.
00:17:08.640 TSX so app tabs index. TSX if you update
00:17:13.880 any of these parts so let's say welcome
00:17:16.439 1 2 3 if I save it it should restart in
00:17:20.359 real time if it doesn't you can go here
00:17:23.400 in your terminal press R which means
00:17:26.520 reload and it should reload with the
00:17:28.960 latest version and you can even run this
00:17:31.640 in your browser so I'll just press W
00:17:34.960 which stands for web browser and this is
00:17:37.799 the actual application right you can
00:17:39.960 build it for the web but in our case we
00:17:42.640 are not really interested in
00:17:45.080 this okay but just keep that in mind it
00:17:47.760 actually it is actually
00:17:50.000 possible okay so I hope we get the point
00:17:53.679 now we are going to reset reset this
00:17:57.200 entire project but I just want to talk
00:17:59.480 about a concept called tab Navigator so
00:18:04.000 as the name suggests you can get a
00:18:06.280 navigation based off of these tabs so
00:18:09.919 here we are in the explore screen and we
00:18:12.679 are in the home screen and this is
00:18:15.159 possible thanks to this tabs folder
00:18:18.440 which is built into Expo so these are
00:18:20.880 the things that we're going to talk
00:18:22.080 about more later in the video but I just
00:18:24.280 wanted to mention it since we have it
00:18:26.280 already now I'll open up my terminal and
00:18:29.480 kill this with command C let's clear
00:18:32.600 this up and we would like to reset this
00:18:35.760 project so they have prepared a reset
00:18:38.720 project script for us we can basically
00:18:41.480 say npm run reset Das project and run
00:18:46.919 this so here it says do you want to move
00:18:50.200 existing files into app example instead
00:18:52.960 of deleting them so let's just say
00:18:55.720 yes and run this
00:18:59.159 and let me make this screen a little bit
00:19:01.400 larger okay so as you can tell
00:19:03.880 everything that we had previously has
00:19:05.880 been moved into this app example folder
00:19:09.080 and since we don't really want to have
00:19:11.080 any boilerplate code we're going to
00:19:12.880 start from scratch we can basically go
00:19:15.400 ahead and delete this entire folder we
00:19:17.960 don't really need it and we'll just
00:19:19.840 start with an empty app folder other
00:19:23.000 than this we have the configurations as
00:19:25.559 well as some assets like fonts and and
00:19:29.400 images okay so that's going to be it for
00:19:32.520 the reset project next we can get
00:19:35.080 started with the
00:19:36.640 basics all right so this is where we
00:19:39.360 left now we're going to start with the
00:19:41.440 basics of react native and I'll try to
00:19:44.799 go really slowly for the next 1 hour
00:19:47.720 until we understand everything then we
00:19:50.320 can just really speed up the process if
00:19:52.840 you ever feel we're going slowly you can
00:19:54.960 speed up the video from the settings uh
00:19:58.320 like from the video settings okay now
00:20:01.440 IID like to start this application I'll
00:20:03.720 open up my terminal and I'll say let's
00:20:06.240 clear this up if you're on Windows you
00:20:08.400 can just say CLS or clear and if you're
00:20:11.919 on Mac you can say command K which would
00:20:14.480 clear this up okay now let's say MPX
00:20:17.679 Expo we can run our new application this
00:20:22.000 is what we had previously so I'll just
00:20:24.280 press R this should
00:20:26.520 reloaded and there we go now I'll visit
00:20:30.000 app index. TSX which is our home screen
00:20:33.440 so it says edit this let's just edit it
00:20:36.080 I'll just add one two three let's save
00:20:38.720 there we go we can see the change in
00:20:40.559 real time now let's talk about the basic
00:20:43.799 component right basic components so here
00:20:46.840 we have a text if you would like to put
00:20:49.720 a text outside of a text component
00:20:52.760 you're going to get errors so here it
00:20:55.000 says any text you have it should go
00:20:57.760 under like inside a text component so we
00:21:01.919 can just say hello there we go this is
00:21:04.679 coming from react native and here we can
00:21:08.080 give some Styles as you can tell let me
00:21:11.080 just like delete
00:21:13.360 this okay so style will take an object
00:21:17.279 with any of the fields that you can
00:21:19.159 think of that is coming from CSS so here
00:21:22.120 we say Flex one justify content and
00:21:24.760 align item Center so that it it can
00:21:27.240 Center it in the middle of the screen
00:21:29.480 but now if you can imagine we might have
00:21:32.600 bunch of different CSS uh Styles and
00:21:36.039 this will get out of hand so there is
00:21:38.279 another solution instead of having all
00:21:40.799 these let's say I'll call this as
00:21:44.720 styles do okay styles. container and
00:21:50.080 where is this Styles coming from so
00:21:52.400 basically we can say const Styles and
00:21:55.640 import
00:21:57.159 stylesheet Style
00:22:00.039 sheet. create now this stylesheet should
00:22:03.799 be coming from react
00:22:05.840 [Music]
00:22:08.400 native just like that and we can say
00:22:11.910 [Music]
00:22:13.200 create this will take an object and here
00:22:16.880 we can add the container
00:22:19.480 class so just like previously we can add
00:22:22.320 those Styles so we had Flex one align
00:22:26.120 items of Center
00:22:29.960 and justify content of
00:22:33.320 Center okay now we can see this is a lot
00:22:36.039 more readable we can just say styles.
00:22:38.480 container here we can have a text so
00:22:41.120 let's say uh title you can call this
00:22:45.039 anything by the way so this can be even
00:22:47.159 hello but it should make sense I'll just
00:22:50.559 say color should be red let's say style
00:22:55.440 styles. tile now this will become red
00:22:58.520 you can say font size will be I don't
00:23:01.360 know let's say
00:23:03.720 50 okay so it'll just update in real
00:23:06.360 time now the beauty of this let's say
00:23:08.880 you have 200 lines of CSS code you can
00:23:12.640 basically create a folder let's say
00:23:16.320 Styles and let's say we're going to have
00:23:18.559 styles for the authentication page we
00:23:21.279 can just say oath. styles. JS now this
00:23:25.960 part is not an extension this is just a
00:23:28.159 con iion that I'd like to use so you can
00:23:30.720 even have this as .js it is a regular
00:23:34.000 JavaScript file and this is also a
00:23:36.840 regular Javascript file but as I said
00:23:39.440 this is the convention that I'd like to
00:23:41.120 use so I will go ahead and create this
00:23:44.080 file let me cut this paste this in and I
00:23:48.000 would like to export this constant let's
00:23:50.880 import the stylesheet save this file now
00:23:53.919 we can get these styles from that file
00:23:57.960 let's delete this I'll say
00:24:00.279 import styles from Styles
00:24:04.720 slash okay maybe we should go one up
00:24:08.960 styles then we have o Styles so it is
00:24:11.840 still working but as you can tell our
00:24:14.000 code base is a lot more cleaner and
00:24:16.640 organized and actually we're going to
00:24:18.640 have bunch of different styles file like
00:24:21.840 bunch of files like these later in the
00:24:24.440 video okay so we have talked about the
00:24:26.840 view text now we could have things like
00:24:30.159 touchable
00:24:31.640 opacity um okay just like this I am a
00:24:36.000 really slow typer but let's just
00:24:39.880 see let's import this we don't really
00:24:42.640 have touchable actually let's delete
00:24:44.240 that we have touchable opacity on press
00:24:47.240 let's just say
00:24:50.320 alert touched
00:24:53.480 okay let's say
00:24:56.279 you touched and here we can add a text
00:24:59.799 in between let's say press me okay if
00:25:03.440 you press that here we can see we just
00:25:05.399 got an alert and in the same way we have
00:25:08.520 pressable
00:25:10.640 component it is also coming from react
00:25:13.279 native and here we have on press on
00:25:16.480 Hover on BL and you can always just go
00:25:19.320 ahead into these components press
00:25:21.480 control space you can really get all the
00:25:24.320 props that they have so in the same way
00:25:27.320 we can copy it
00:25:29.039 paste
00:25:30.360 it let's say press
00:25:33.120 me
00:25:35.679 pressible okay so it is working in the
00:25:39.120 same way but obviously they have some
00:25:42.440 differences uh we're going to be talking
00:25:44.960 about them later in the video but just
00:25:47.360 know that touchable opacity gives you
00:25:49.919 this opacity feedback out of the box so
00:25:52.600 can you see it like I'll just delete
00:25:55.480 this once I click to it like for a
00:25:58.640 second we have this aacd feedback and
00:26:01.559 this is why you might want to use it
00:26:03.279 most of the time and it's actually a
00:26:05.679 simpler component than
00:26:08.159 pressible okay then we can have like
00:26:11.200 images let's say we're going to get an
00:26:13.640 image component that could be either
00:26:15.960 coming from react native or Expo for now
00:26:19.200 let's use the one that is coming from
00:26:21.520 react native and here we could have a
00:26:24.240 source and here if the image is going to
00:26:27.679 be coming from from your local files
00:26:30.320 let's say we're going to get this
00:26:32.480 icon.png then you need to require it
00:26:36.440 since it is a local image right let me
00:26:40.120 kill the left hand side I'll say
00:26:43.480 require and give the exact
00:26:46.840 path so I think this is not the correct
00:26:49.520 path so we should go one up under the
00:26:52.039 assets under the
00:26:54.360 images um do we have logo.png okay no we
00:26:58.080 don't don't actually have the logo.png
00:27:00.279 but we have icon.png and we can get this
00:27:03.840 we can add some styles on top of it like
00:27:07.799 width let's say 200 and height as
00:27:11.940 [Music]
00:27:14.120 well okay for some reason it did not
00:27:16.799 refresh it I'll just say R okay no it
00:27:21.520 didn't okay so I have just found the
00:27:23.799 solution I think instead of width and
00:27:25.799 height we should have this style with
00:27:27.880 the WID and height now it is working as
00:27:30.559 expected and if the image is coming from
00:27:33.480 a remote uh Network let's say we're
00:27:36.480 going to get an image from unsplash so
00:27:39.600 let's grab this image address uh copy
00:27:43.720 image address let's go back to vs code
00:27:46.960 here in this case you would like to
00:27:49.279 actually use a field called URI and once
00:27:53.679 you paste it it should work
00:27:58.279 let's see why this did not work maybe we
00:28:00.480 should add some
00:28:03.000 Styles say width is going to be again
00:28:05.960 200 okay now it is working if you're
00:28:08.919 getting an image from a remote Network
00:28:11.919 like unsplash or I don't know any place
00:28:14.840 it should have this URI field but if it
00:28:17.519 is a local image you should require it
00:28:20.279 from the like from the relative path
00:28:24.559 okay so I hope that makes
00:28:26.240 sense so these are are the basic
00:28:29.159 components that we have just explored
00:28:32.200 but on top of these there is a file
00:28:34.720 called underscore layout. TSX this is an
00:28:38.760 actual special file that we should keep
00:28:41.480 in mind we can create multiple layout
00:28:44.360 files in different places so currently
00:28:47.640 this gives us the stack Navigator which
00:28:50.600 is something that we'll talk about in a
00:28:52.399 second and here the index. TSX file is
00:28:56.000 also a convention so for your your
00:28:58.360 homepages in different routes you would
00:29:02.240 call it you would call it as index so
00:29:06.080 instead of calling this home. TSX we
00:29:08.320 just say index. TSX and if you had
00:29:11.240 different routes the entry files would
00:29:13.720 be index now I know this might sound
00:29:16.080 complicated but we're going to see a
00:29:17.600 couple of different examples and
00:29:20.440 anything that goes into this app folder
00:29:23.000 will become a screen so in our
00:29:25.720 application we're going to have a bunch
00:29:27.240 of different screens
00:29:28.760 like profile screen notification screen
00:29:31.960 create post screen home screen so on and
00:29:35.000 so forth and we're going to put all of
00:29:37.000 them into this folder now we have talked
00:29:39.919 about the stack Navigator um like how
00:29:43.880 does that work let's go ahead and create
00:29:46.200 a couple of different files I will have
00:29:48.840 a
00:29:49.720 profile. TSX and I am using an extension
00:29:53.880 let me show this
00:29:58.320 it is called
00:30:00.880 es7 react reactnative Snippets if you
00:30:04.440 get this you should be able to do this
00:30:07.000 shortcut
00:30:08.799 rnf it will give you a functional react
00:30:11.760 native component so let's say this is
00:30:15.440 profile
00:30:17.480 screen and we can uppercase this
00:30:21.360 one then let's have another screen
00:30:24.799 called notifications.
00:30:28.720 GSX or TSX actually we're using
00:30:31.559 typescript once again I'll say rnf and
00:30:34.320 let's just say
00:30:36.480 notifications
00:30:38.840 screen I'll save those now from the
00:30:42.519 homepage I will link this so I'll say
00:30:45.240 link this is another component here I
00:30:47.679 just get that from Expo router and I'll
00:30:51.120 say visit
00:30:54.039 notifications
00:30:55.679 screen and let's say h ra will take us
00:30:59.320 to/ notifications and as you can tell it
00:31:02.360 is type save out of the box let's save
00:31:05.320 from the homepage we can visit the
00:31:07.519 notification screen I'll click that okay
00:31:11.320 it says no rout P I think we should
00:31:14.039 restart this with r now I'll try to
00:31:17.880 collect it there we go now as you can
00:31:20.399 tell new screens are coming from the
00:31:22.960 right hand side right this is what stack
00:31:26.799 Navigator allows to have and if you go
00:31:29.559 back now notice how this screen will go
00:31:32.200 from left to
00:31:34.399 right okay so new screens will be coming
00:31:37.639 from right and if you want to go back
00:31:40.480 they will be popped right and this is
00:31:43.399 what sex uh Navigator allows us to have
00:31:46.840 then if we wanted to we can make this
00:31:50.600 like s uh not self Clos tag I was going
00:31:54.480 to say and here we can add different
00:31:58.159 screens so I'll just say stack. screen
00:32:01.159 for the homepage which we call this as
00:32:04.399 index we can actually hide the header so
00:32:09.200 here if you save it now header is gone
00:32:11.799 right and you can like bring this back
00:32:14.840 let's just say bring the header we can
00:32:17.919 change this name so we can say title
00:32:20.720 will be home because this is our actual
00:32:23.320 homepage or we can call this as feed if
00:32:26.240 this is a social media application and
00:32:28.559 we can visit the notifications page
00:32:30.919 instead of having this as lowercased we
00:32:34.120 can actually uh change it as well so
00:32:37.720 here we'll say go into the notifications
00:32:41.320 screen and make the title to be
00:32:45.120 notifications so here we just uppercase
00:32:47.360 the end let's save there we go and now
00:32:50.559 there is one issue here let's say um
00:32:54.320 here I'll go ahead and just say header
00:32:56.840 shown will be
00:32:59.279 false and you're going to see that
00:33:02.000 content overflows with this status bar
00:33:04.919 that we have at the top and if we wanted
00:33:07.200 to take this into the view always we can
00:33:10.480 just go ahead wrap it with something
00:33:13.000 called save area provider so I'll go
00:33:16.320 here I'll just say save area provider
00:33:20.240 component and wrap everything with it
00:33:23.320 then we would like to have save area
00:33:25.840 view component let's say import this as
00:33:28.760 well wrap everything with it and now if
00:33:33.120 we give this some styling let's say uh
00:33:36.000 not class name but let's say style we're
00:33:39.399 going to say Flex will be one so that it
00:33:42.240 will take the entire screen and here we
00:33:44.440 go now it is inside the view it is not
00:33:47.200 overflowing with the status bar so this
00:33:49.880 is something that you should also keep
00:33:51.440 in mind like you can change the
00:33:53.080 background so on and so forth this is an
00:33:56.360 absolutely important component that you
00:33:58.720 should keep in mind and we'll be using
00:34:01.080 this actually later in the video um so
00:34:04.720 now what should we what should we be
00:34:07.399 doing is to show you this image in our
00:34:10.918 application we're going to have a bunch
00:34:12.760 of different screens right and we're
00:34:15.040 going to have the tab Navigator so we'll
00:34:18.040 have home screen bookmarks create
00:34:21.280 notifications as well as the profile
00:34:23.679 screen and now let's try to create this
00:34:26.879 tab with the the related screens I will
00:34:30.199 go into my vs code and if you remember
00:34:35.239 we had a special folder called tabs so
00:34:38.760 I'll go ahead open this up the brackets
00:34:41.199 and just put tabs name in between okay
00:34:44.560 this is a special file that Expo will
00:34:47.000 take a look to be able to implement the
00:34:49.399 tabs
00:34:51.119 Navigator here I'll put a special file
00:34:54.159 once again which is going to be our
00:34:56.119 layout. TSX file then we can put our
00:35:00.040 tabs so we're going to have the profile
00:35:03.480 I'll just drag and drop it we'll have
00:35:05.800 the
00:35:06.760 notifications so we are going to have
00:35:09.440 let's say what do we have let's take a
00:35:11.760 look so we are going to have create and
00:35:13.960 bookmarks as well as the home
00:35:16.560 screen so let's try to do it slowly
00:35:19.359 we'll have
00:35:21.560 create. TSX and we can say rnf to get
00:35:26.000 this boilerplate code
00:35:28.240 code and here we'll also have bookmarks
00:35:32.440 let's
00:35:33.480 [Music]
00:35:37.079 say okay now let's save all of these I
00:35:40.720 think we can also take the homepage
00:35:43.440 in which is going to be called as index
00:35:46.839 right let's say save
00:35:49.599 this now we don't really have an index
00:35:52.359 in the root level so we can go ahead and
00:35:55.440 just add an index file here as well I'll
00:35:58.880 say index. TSX let's say rnf this could
00:36:02.640 be our starter point and all this file
00:36:05.920 will be doing is to redirect the user to
00:36:08.720 the feed which is this file so I know
00:36:12.040 this might look complicated but I
00:36:13.720 promise this will make sense just in a
00:36:15.640 second let's say from here we will take
00:36:19.520 our users to tabs okay this will take us
00:36:23.520 to the entry
00:36:25.160 point so once again this will make sense
00:36:27.920 just in a second now let's try to
00:36:30.880 actually put these colors as well as
00:36:33.560 these icons into our tab Navigator so
00:36:37.000 for this we're going to visit vs code
00:36:39.800 under the layout let's say rnf here we
00:36:43.800 can just call this as tab
00:36:46.920 layout you can call this anything but I
00:36:49.400 think this makes sense and let's shrink
00:36:51.280 the left hand side instead of having a
00:36:53.800 view we're going to get the tabs
00:36:56.200 component from X router and we're going
00:36:59.119 to give every single Tab screen so just
00:37:02.040 like in this tag Navigator we'll say
00:37:04.640 tabs. screen and we are going to put our
00:37:07.920 options so the first thing we need for
00:37:10.280 every single screen is the name and
00:37:13.280 first we'll have the index point which
00:37:15.720 is going to be the homepage right this
00:37:18.000 is the starter page that we'll have then
00:37:20.760 we're going to have five more tabs let's
00:37:24.160 try to put those I will duplicate it one
00:37:27.280 2 2 3 four and five let's say we're
00:37:30.680 going to have
00:37:32.440 bookmarks we're going to have
00:37:35.200 create we can have
00:37:38.720 notifications and I think we're going
00:37:40.839 have profile maybe that was like 1 2 3 4
00:37:46.280 okay that should be enough we have five
00:37:48.960 screens for some reason I put six but
00:37:51.920 there we go let's save and try to see
00:37:54.319 this in action do we have anything I'll
00:37:57.280 just press R there we go we got five
00:38:01.280 different tabs but now they don't really
00:38:03.880 have an icon and also I don't really
00:38:06.640 want to see this uh name at the bottom
00:38:10.200 we only want to see the icons for this
00:38:13.480 we can change our options here under the
00:38:16.880 tabs let me just say um screen
00:38:22.720 options which is going to take an object
00:38:25.839 so here I'll just say t M
00:38:28.800 Bar show label and I'll just save fals
00:38:33.720 if you save it should get rid of those
00:38:36.520 names and let's try to change the icon
00:38:39.480 for every single Tab screen so for the
00:38:42.480 homepage we'll say options we're just
00:38:45.400 going to take an object where we'll just
00:38:47.200 say tab bar icon and this is going to
00:38:50.560 take a call back function so just like
00:38:53.200 this instead of returning a text we
00:38:55.400 would like to return an icon this is
00:38:57.839 going to be a self-closed tag just like
00:39:00.599 that let's say we are going to get ion
00:39:04.440 icons let's say ion icons for some
00:39:08.280 reason this does not a to complete for
00:39:10.480 me let me try to get it from Expo Vector
00:39:14.640 icons so xook gives you different icons
00:39:17.960 out of the box and for the name of the
00:39:20.560 icon we'll get the home let's
00:39:23.359 save here we can see it has just been
00:39:25.839 updated but it is super tiny we can go
00:39:29.319 ahead change the size as well as the
00:39:32.640 color so we'll just take the size as it
00:39:36.079 is the default size as well as the
00:39:38.480 default
00:39:40.160 color so let me just zoom out so that
00:39:42.800 you can see the entire line and there we
00:39:45.560 go it is a little bit larger and it got
00:39:47.800 this blue color if you delete this it
00:39:51.079 will be black so it doesn't really get
00:39:53.400 the actual Theme by default this is blue
00:39:56.760 but we're going to change the colors
00:40:00.119 okay so in the same way we are going to
00:40:02.200 add couple of different icons so here
00:40:04.920 let me just give you the name of these
00:40:06.640 icons so you can just pause the video
00:40:09.040 and maybe try to add it by your own so
00:40:12.200 for the bookmarks are icon name is
00:40:14.720 bookmarks for the create it is ADD
00:40:18.200 Circle then for the notifications it is
00:40:21.359 heart and for profile it is person
00:40:25.400 Circle okay so once you have done this
00:40:28.280 let's watch my solution where I'll
00:40:30.560 basically copy and paste let's not waste
00:40:33.280 the time it the exact same thing then
00:40:36.040 for the
00:40:39.319 create let me get this and let's
00:40:42.200 actually save there we go it has just
00:40:43.960 been updated and you know as it is
00:40:46.560 focused the color will change okay for
00:40:50.079 the create we would like to get this but
00:40:53.240 now here for the color I used something
00:40:56.200 called primary color which is going to
00:40:58.800 be this green color so let's go ahead
00:41:01.319 and create this colors under a folder
00:41:05.319 called
00:41:08.740 [Music]
00:41:10.000 constants and I will have this theme. TS
00:41:13.520 file which you can grab it from the
00:41:15.839 source code let me try to provide this
00:41:18.720 to you it's around 10 lines of code we
00:41:22.000 have a primary color secondary
00:41:24.720 background so on and so forth I have for
00:41:27.280 preped these already so once you get
00:41:30.119 that we can import these colors and use
00:41:34.119 the primary color for this icon okay
00:41:36.960 there we go then what do we want to do
00:41:40.000 now let's get the notifications as
00:41:45.000 well okay paste
00:41:47.760 it and then for the profile so since
00:41:51.599 this is the exact same thing I don't
00:41:53.119 really want to type this out we don't
00:41:54.839 really need to waste five minutes on
00:41:56.839 these now basically we are just
00:41:58.920 returning a call back with this ion
00:42:02.119 icons right okay everything seems
00:42:05.240 correct to me but why this is blue and
00:42:08.680 this is green let's go ahead and change
00:42:11.359 the general color on each icon which is
00:42:15.280 going to be under the screen options on
00:42:17.760 the actual tabs component in the parent
00:42:21.280 component right now first off I don't
00:42:24.400 really want to see the tabs so I'll go
00:42:26.760 ahead and add this header shown to be
00:42:29.599 false let's save the tabs has just gone
00:42:32.960 here we see still tabs but it is coming
00:42:35.760 from the stack Navigator so we can go
00:42:38.680 ahead and actually say um let's say
00:42:42.319 style uh basically I'll just get this
00:42:46.079 part let's say style this is something
00:42:48.880 that we have done previously we'll just
00:42:50.720 say header shown to be
00:42:52.880 false okay why did not work I think we
00:42:56.319 can just delete those
00:42:59.440 um
00:43:01.079 wait let's just make it to be look like
00:43:03.920 this okay so my bad instead of style it
00:43:07.160 should be screen options because we are
00:43:09.680 in the parent component so time to time
00:43:13.079 I can also make mistakes but let's just
00:43:15.240 ignore the fact I'll just save there we
00:43:17.640 go that tab is also gone right now we'll
00:43:20.839 go ahead here and we'll like to add some
00:43:23.359 other styles so we would like to change
00:43:26.040 the color right right for this we can
00:43:28.200 get the primary color on the tab bar
00:43:31.599 active tint color so if you save if it
00:43:34.640 is active we're going to get this
00:43:36.480 primary color and we can change the
00:43:39.480 inactive color as well just like that
00:43:42.880 let's save there we go it just changed a
00:43:45.599 bit if you can see then we can add like
00:43:49.440 tab bar style now you might be asking
00:43:52.800 hey how do I learn all these props well
00:43:55.800 basically as you need them as you build
00:43:58.480 more projects you're going to see and
00:44:01.480 understand all of them more and more so
00:44:03.839 this is what I'm doing as well before I
00:44:06.280 record these videos I just go ahead and
00:44:08.680 experience with most of the things and
00:44:11.319 the most common things that are in the
00:44:13.680 documentation and these are one of those
00:44:16.280 things that I have built already so just
00:44:19.680 please don't get overwhelmed you might
00:44:21.440 be asking hey there are millions of
00:44:23.559 things how do I learn every single one
00:44:25.839 of them so so technically and honestly
00:44:28.880 you don't really need to learn 99% of
00:44:31.520 them only the things that you actually
00:44:33.720 need and in our case tab bar style is
00:44:37.079 one of them so I will grab this from my
00:44:39.520 notes and paste it instead of typing
00:44:41.880 this out I can explain every single line
00:44:44.960 so here this is the tab bar style that
00:44:48.280 we are updating let me just save okay we
00:44:51.359 have just changed the background color
00:44:53.920 just make it to be black we make the top
00:44:57.520 bar like border top width to be zero
00:45:01.520 Position will be absolute elevation of
00:45:04.559 zero and you might be asking what the
00:45:06.800 heck is elevation you can't read it it
00:45:09.200 is basically something specific to
00:45:11.559 Android and I have test this out
00:45:14.160 elevation zero looks a lot better that's
00:45:16.920 why I just you know ignore that then
00:45:19.599 height is 40 you can make it to be 80
00:45:22.680 like double it you can see the change
00:45:25.559 but I think 40 is pretty equ to our and
00:45:28.640 we give some petting of bottom of eight
00:45:32.160 okay these are the styles that we have
00:45:34.200 just
00:45:35.040 added now we're going to make the rest
00:45:37.960 of our application to be in the black uh
00:45:41.480 background color but we'll just get
00:45:44.160 there step by step now what I want to do
00:45:47.359 just basically kill all these and take a
00:45:51.960 step like take a moment try to
00:45:55.079 understand what the heck is happening in
00:45:57.040 our application so everything starts
00:46:00.000 from the app folder from the layout. TSX
00:46:03.559 this is the first file that is run okay
00:46:06.680 so here we wrap our entire application
00:46:09.559 with a safe area provider and safe area
00:46:12.960 view components so that our com so that
00:46:16.040 our content is always in the safe area
00:46:19.280 it is not overflowing with the status
00:46:21.760 bar and in the index page we are
00:46:25.000 basically taking the user immediately to
00:46:28.200 our tabs folder and specifically into
00:46:31.400 the homepage right this is our homepage
00:46:35.240 let's just say this is the feed screen
00:46:38.319 in
00:46:39.720 tabs okay so whenever you reload your
00:46:42.400 application by default your IND this
00:46:44.599 page and from here since we set it up
00:46:47.680 our tabs we can go into the bookmarks
00:46:50.720 right it will open up this file and
00:46:53.240 render it then we can go into the create
00:46:56.000 notifications and profile screen so I
00:46:59.520 hope this makes sense we are going to
00:47:01.400 fix the styling uh we're going to make
00:47:03.720 it actually look a lot better but this
00:47:06.680 is the general idea of our application
00:47:09.960 right so we have tabs which stands for
00:47:12.680 tabs Navigator and it goes under the
00:47:15.200 tabs folder this is a special folder
00:47:17.800 that Expo gives you then from here you
00:47:20.480 can change the general styles on each
00:47:24.000 Tab and specifically you can do like
00:47:28.280 change the options for the icons so on
00:47:31.240 and so
00:47:32.440 forth so this is what we have done so
00:47:35.839 far now just before we move on with the
00:47:38.680 next section let's go ahead delete these
00:47:41.040 Imports and change the background color
00:47:43.720 of our entire application which is going
00:47:46.040 to be under the layout here I'll just
00:47:48.400 say background
00:47:50.640 color will be black and it should update
00:47:54.440 it and here in react native the other
00:47:57.160 color formats are also supported so you
00:47:59.839 can say like black or you can say hex
00:48:02.680 code right FFF you should save it and it
00:48:05.640 should work like let's do
00:48:08.000 CCC like it should work you get the
00:48:10.200 point and also rgba works I think also
00:48:14.200 hsl works but in our case I'll just be
00:48:18.319 I'll be using this simple black color
00:48:21.119 and we can keep it shorter if you really
00:48:23.119 wanted to we'll go with 0 0 0 it's the
00:48:26.839 same thing there we go we have the
00:48:29.000 colors as well and later in the video
00:48:31.319 we'll just see how to change the
00:48:33.160 background color of each screen so with
00:48:35.960 that I'll see you in the next section
00:48:38.400 all right so this is where we left now
00:48:40.880 it is time to implement authentication
00:48:43.319 and connect our application to a
00:48:45.839 database and for this we'll be using
00:48:48.520 Clerk and convex you can find the link
00:48:51.200 in the description so let's go ahead and
00:48:53.440 visit clerk to implement the
00:48:55.240 authentication first now I am in the
00:48:58.040 homepage of the clerk if you haven't
00:49:00.119 heard of it it's the most comprehensive
00:49:02.520 user management platform and in this
00:49:05.200 project we'll be using it to handle the
00:49:07.559 entire authentication flow while making
00:49:10.280 our application completely secure and
00:49:13.200 some production grade applications and
00:49:15.720 companies are actually using it so it is
00:49:18.359 pretty cool and it is really cheap to
00:49:20.520 get started with it it's free right so
00:49:23.720 up to 10,000 users you can use it for
00:49:26.720 completely free and probably you will
00:49:29.359 never hit this amount of users so let's
00:49:31.880 go ahead and get started with it I
00:49:35.040 already have an account so I'll just go
00:49:37.079 ahead and visit my dashboard let me just
00:49:40.480 try to quickly log
00:49:43.040 in and there we go now we would like to
00:49:46.359 create an application let's say create
00:49:48.839 an app I will call this as Spotlight
00:49:51.920 this is the name that I'd like to use
00:49:53.760 you can call this anything I will
00:49:55.720 disable any other providers other than
00:49:58.559 Google if you really want to you can
00:50:00.680 just op them in right like you
00:50:03.920 can have all these others uh providers
00:50:07.839 but in my case I'll just be using Google
00:50:10.720 because that's the only thing that we
00:50:11.960 would need let's say create the
00:50:15.359 application and we have a bunch of
00:50:17.400 different sdks and guides in our case
00:50:20.480 we'll like to use it with Expo so I'll
00:50:23.440 select this and let's go through these
00:50:25.920 steps one by one first we'll like to get
00:50:28.880 clerk Expo right I'll open up my
00:50:32.640 terminal tell
00:50:35.200 this paste this in then the next step is
00:50:39.040 to get the types to make the typescript
00:50:42.200 happy get the type
00:50:44.640 definitions so once this is done we can
00:50:47.440 paste that
00:50:50.359 in okay so this is what happens if you
00:50:53.920 live in turkey with a shitty internet
00:50:56.119 connection but there we go I'll go ahead
00:50:58.520 paste this
00:50:59.599 in then we would like to set our
00:51:02.520 environment variables I'll copy this
00:51:05.200 here they say use a EnV file now later
00:51:08.599 in the video we'll be using convex and
00:51:11.799 they actually use env. loal file which
00:51:15.599 is the same thing but let's go ahead and
00:51:17.880 create this one I will paste this in
00:51:20.440 which is the clerk publishable key um
00:51:24.000 this is something clerk will use just in
00:51:26.640 a couple of seconds so we need to visit
00:51:28.960 the layout and wrap our application with
00:51:32.000 this clerk provider now I'll copy this
00:51:34.839 part and actually all these visit my
00:51:38.079 layout file it should be in the
00:51:42.640 root now I can feel this might look a
00:51:45.559 bit
00:51:47.200 overwhelming but let's just see now the
00:51:50.200 reason that I say it's overwhelming is
00:51:52.160 because we have really a limited space
00:51:54.720 font size is too large but there we go
00:51:57.520 we got the publishable key which is
00:51:59.319 coming from the environment variables
00:52:02.400 and we can WB our entire application
00:52:04.720 with this
00:52:06.000 part so here I'll go ahead wrap my
00:52:10.740 [Music]
00:52:13.079 application and let's get this one close
00:52:16.400 this off there we go we need to import
00:52:18.799 these they are going to be coming from
00:52:22.400 clerk so I'll copy that and
00:52:26.230 [Music]
00:52:28.440 okay now let's save this should be happy
00:52:30.880 with us but we have some more stuff to
00:52:33.280 do now clerk stores the active users
00:52:37.040 session token in memory by default and
00:52:40.280 in Expo applications the recommended way
00:52:42.960 to store sensitive data such as tokens
00:52:46.160 is by using Expo secure store package
00:52:49.799 which is going to encrypt the data
00:52:51.760 before restoring it so we're going to go
00:52:54.119 ahead and install this to make our
00:52:56.599 application a lot more safe let's
00:53:00.400 paste oops what have I done let's just
00:53:03.040 paste it I think I have just done a
00:53:05.160 mistake let me just copy this once
00:53:09.359 again clear up the terminal and paste
00:53:12.119 this
00:53:13.079 in next we would like to create a cache.
00:53:16.520 TS file in our root directory let's copy
00:53:20.960 this so these are just some steps that
00:53:23.720 we are doing that we are never going to
00:53:25.839 be thinking about it later this will
00:53:28.960 make our application completely secure
00:53:31.720 and authentication will work flawlessly
00:53:34.799 so we have 30 lines of code which is
00:53:37.720 something that clerk needs to be able to
00:53:40.520 get the token as well as save the token
00:53:43.400 to handle the authentication so you
00:53:45.599 don't really need to understand
00:53:47.319 everything that is going on here there's
00:53:49.160 a lot of magic that is happening behind
00:53:51.760 the
00:53:52.480 scenes okay then now that we have got
00:53:55.920 this token we're going to go ahead add
00:53:58.359 this token cache into our clerk provider
00:54:01.799 so I'll copy this
00:54:04.640 part save this file go into layout and
00:54:08.760 here we would like to oops what have I
00:54:11.720 done let's say token cache and we're
00:54:14.400 going to get the token cache from this
00:54:16.520 cache file that we had and I think our
00:54:19.359 application should be ready to go here
00:54:22.400 they have bunch of different steps that
00:54:24.720 we'll be doing in a couple of
00:54:27.640 minutes okay so with this now in our
00:54:30.400 entire application we have Clerk
00:54:33.799 initialized and we can use the
00:54:36.119 authentication so let's see we would
00:54:39.040 like to build the authentication page so
00:54:41.680 you can get these designs I think I
00:54:44.720 forgot to add the authentication screen
00:54:47.119 but let me show you this pretty quickly
00:54:49.599 so I have just add it right here this is
00:54:52.040 the authentication screen let's take a
00:54:54.480 look at it we have an icon
00:54:57.119 we have the title A P tag maybe a
00:55:00.880 description an image as well as our
00:55:03.799 authentication button so let's go ahead
00:55:06.200 and design this then we're going to make
00:55:08.040 this work with the clerk I'll open up my
00:55:10.880 PS code here I would like to create an
00:55:13.920 authentication page so it's not going to
00:55:16.119 be a part of the tabs because as you can
00:55:18.520 tell we don't really have the navigation
00:55:20.720 for this page or for this screen I
00:55:24.039 should say we are not in the web
00:55:25.799 development so we don't really have
00:55:27.520 pages but instead we have screens and
00:55:30.160 let's start with the authentication I
00:55:32.240 will create this folder and here we can
00:55:34.760 put a login. TSX file and here we would
00:55:39.559 like to basically have our Styles first
00:55:42.799 then we will implement the functionality
00:55:45.960 now here this is not a CSS course that's
00:55:49.079 why I would like to skip this Styles
00:55:51.599 part here we have a oath styles. JS file
00:55:56.440 and let's actually make this to be a
00:55:58.480 typescript file I'll just say oath
00:56:01.440 styles. TS and I will provide this file
00:56:04.640 to you so you can grab this from the
00:56:07.240 GitHub repo and let me show you the
00:56:09.799 entire
00:56:11.280 page if you want to type this out so we
00:56:14.319 are getting the colors we are getting
00:56:16.280 stylesheet as well as Dimensions where
00:56:19.400 we will just check the width and height
00:56:21.440 of the screen here we have container
00:56:24.280 brand section basically this is some CSS
00:56:27.720 styling just to make our application
00:56:30.280 look clean and
00:56:33.160 nice okay so I don't really think we
00:56:35.920 should be spending 10 minutes to write
00:56:38.720 all these classes that's why I'll just
00:56:41.160 provide them to you okay this is super
00:56:44.039 simple styling once again with this in
00:56:47.319 mind let's go ahead and actually try to
00:56:49.640 build the login page I'll just get rnf
00:56:53.480 let's try to save this file and actually
00:56:56.280 actually try to build the content so
00:56:59.799 here I'll sharing the left hand side we
00:57:02.319 going to have a view with some styling
00:57:05.720 let's say style will be styles.
00:57:08.599 container and these Styles will be
00:57:10.880 coming from oath Styles file then we
00:57:14.720 will have the brand section so I'll go
00:57:17.559 ahead say brand
00:57:20.240 section and let's just say we will have
00:57:24.119 a view let me please get this and I
00:57:28.680 don't really want anyone to get mad at
00:57:31.079 me just because I copy and paste but
00:57:33.640 this is really really basic stuff that
00:57:36.160 we have seen couple of sections ago we
00:57:38.880 are having a view with a style an icon
00:57:42.760 and some text so there is nothing logic
00:57:45.559 here that's why I would like to copy and
00:57:47.839 paste and we'll you through it so typing
00:57:50.559 this would take 3 minutes explaining
00:57:53.400 would take 30 seconds okay I hope this
00:57:56.559 makes sense now we got the brand section
00:57:59.200 let's save and try to see what we're
00:58:01.680 going to get currently we are in the
00:58:03.839 feed screen what I want to do just go
00:58:07.480 into the actual index file and for now
00:58:12.160 I'll just take my users to the
00:58:14.480 authentication so let's say
00:58:16.680 oath maybe to
00:58:20.160 login okay for some reason we cannot
00:58:23.480 [Music]
00:58:24.640 get the type
00:58:27.920 safety maybe we should start our
00:58:30.599 application I'll just say MPX
00:58:34.640 Expo press R
00:58:39.960 and make it look like
00:58:44.480 this okay we have all login I forgot to
00:58:47.599 wrap this with
00:58:50.319 parenthesis now I'll just uh reload this
00:58:53.760 once again it should work here we go
00:58:56.599 this is what we have in the
00:58:57.920 authentication page specifically in the
00:59:00.480 login page we just added the uh brand
00:59:03.720 section now we'll like to have an
00:59:06.240 illustration where we'll like to get
00:59:08.280 this image so I've got this from a
00:59:11.319 website called story
00:59:13.680 set let me show this story set.com it
00:59:17.960 should be and I think I got it from the
00:59:21.960 Bro
00:59:23.280 Styles I search for something like
00:59:27.079 social and let me actually provide you
00:59:29.799 the actual link so I have just grabbed
00:59:32.640 the link let me paste it it is story
00:59:35.240 set.com SL illustration slashonline
00:59:38.760 wishes SL bro it's funny name but there
00:59:42.760 we go this is the image that you can go
00:59:44.920 ahead and download it then put it into
00:59:47.839 your assets or you can simply grab it
00:59:51.240 from the GitHub Revo so under the images
00:59:54.200 I would like to get this
00:59:57.000 image from the source code so I'll take
01:00:01.920 the oath bg2 this is what I have called
01:00:05.720 it and just like if you want to use a
01:00:08.520 different images I have prepared two of
01:00:11.400 them as well so o bj3 and one I would
01:00:15.319 like to use this one but you can use any
01:00:17.760 of the the others that we have all right
01:00:21.359 so we would like to get the illustration
01:00:23.799 now it is your challenge to go ahead and
01:00:26.000 and display the image on the screen so
01:00:28.760 we have seen this previously since it is
01:00:31.200 a local image we need to require it in
01:00:34.039 the uh in the image source so here I'll
01:00:37.280 just say
01:00:39.880 illustration and paste it we have an
01:00:43.359 image let's import it from react native
01:00:45.880 and under the source we are going to get
01:00:47.760 this image since this is a local image
01:00:50.160 we need to require it right let's save
01:00:53.559 there we go this is what we got you can
01:00:55.559 use cover or contain this is basic CSS
01:00:59.359 I'll go with the cover and after the
01:01:02.240 illustration we can put the login
01:01:06.280 section basically where we have the
01:01:08.880 button right I would like to once again
01:01:12.839 copy this and paste it and please don't
01:01:16.119 get mad this is super basic stuff that
01:01:18.240 we have seen so far like VI touchable
01:01:21.160 opacity style onpress like this is
01:01:24.480 something that we haven't seen but name
01:01:26.599 makes sense like on press we don't have
01:01:29.039 this function let's leave it as an empty
01:01:31.960 function for
01:01:33.760 now we'll just say console
01:01:37.079 log okay let's save this is what we got
01:01:40.119 with the
01:01:41.240 styling now we should be able to make
01:01:43.880 this work currently if you click to it
01:01:47.200 we just see a console log but we are
01:01:49.319 going to make it work with Clerk and
01:01:51.520 specifically with the Google
01:01:53.319 authentication now when we click to this
01:01:55.520 button instead of doing this dummy
01:01:57.920 operation let's actually call this
01:02:00.359 function handle Google signin which is
01:02:03.200 something that will create above so
01:02:05.839 let's say const handle Google signin
01:02:08.559 this is going to be an async arrow
01:02:10.880 function and here we would like to do
01:02:13.559 something which is first we need to get
01:02:17.160 something from use SSO from clerk so use
01:02:21.240 single sign on and here we'll like to
01:02:23.880 get start SSO flow
01:02:26.559 and here I would like to get the router
01:02:29.400 just like in react but this is going to
01:02:31.400 be coming from let's say Expo router
01:02:34.400 this will allow us to do navigation
01:02:36.880 manually here I would like to have a try
01:02:40.000 catch block um here in the try we'll
01:02:43.279 like to say await start SSO flow and our
01:02:48.520 strategy will be all Google you can see
01:02:51.640 there are a bunch of different options
01:02:53.400 but in our case we are going with Google
01:02:56.400 and this will give us a couple of
01:02:58.240 different things which we can D
01:03:01.000 structure like we can get the create
01:03:03.799 session ID as well as set active so all
01:03:08.039 these are coming from the clerk
01:03:09.760 documentation please feel free to check
01:03:12.119 this out uh let's say set active if we
01:03:15.480 got this and if create session ID
01:03:18.039 existed we would like to say set active
01:03:21.319 with the uh session created session ID
01:03:25.319 this will be basically authenticate the
01:03:27.960 current user and once we are
01:03:29.799 authenticated we can just replace the
01:03:32.319 current screen with the homepage which
01:03:35.039 is going to be tabs right okay just like
01:03:37.920 that in the catch we can just put a
01:03:40.079 console log and we should be good to go
01:03:44.079 let's say this is going to be
01:03:46.240 error okay I'll save and let's click to
01:03:50.319 this here we go it says Expo wants to
01:03:53.599 use google.com let's just say continue
01:03:56.839 we should be able to see our accounts so
01:03:59.240 these are the things like these are the
01:04:01.039 accounts that I have added previously
01:04:03.000 and the language is Turkish at the
01:04:05.319 moment let's just make it to be English
01:04:07.720 so that everyone is
01:04:11.400 happy okay so let's just try to log in
01:04:14.400 with this one let's say
01:04:17.680 continue okay since we are since we are
01:04:20.559 just authenticated it take us to the uh
01:04:24.119 feed page right we just go go into the
01:04:26.599 homepage or home screen I should say if
01:04:29.520 you visit your dashboard you should be
01:04:31.520 able to see that you have a user that is
01:04:34.200 just logged in which means everything is
01:04:36.839 working
01:04:38.920 correctly okay but now if we restart our
01:04:42.599 application what is going to happen it
01:04:45.480 will still take us to the authentication
01:04:47.599 page it is because in our root layout
01:04:51.520 let me close everything in our root
01:04:53.960 layout we don't really have any check
01:04:56.520 for the authentication right we always
01:04:59.480 take the user to the login page or login
01:05:02.960 screen but we should fix it right in our
01:05:06.160 root layout before our application
01:05:08.680 started we should check if user is
01:05:11.240 authenticated or not depending on that
01:05:13.799 we should take the user either to the
01:05:15.920 login page or to the related page right
01:05:19.760 so for this I would like to go ahead
01:05:21.880 create a component so that I can put the
01:05:24.720 logic specifically into that file so
01:05:27.880 just say
01:05:28.839 components the name that I'll come up
01:05:31.200 with will be initial L out. TSX you can
01:05:35.880 call this anything but I think this
01:05:37.640 makes sense so I'll say
01:05:39.760 rnf which will be a functional component
01:05:43.200 and here we don't really have anything
01:05:45.119 related to react native because we are
01:05:47.200 not going to return um jsx right let's
01:05:51.079 just delete this this will be a
01:05:52.960 component where we handle the
01:05:54.839 Authentication and navigation let me
01:05:58.160 zoom in once again okay so first I would
01:06:01.359 like to get some stuff from use oath
01:06:05.279 from clerk so what can we get from here
01:06:08.520 let's say we would like to check if
01:06:11.200 clerk is loaded right you can read the
01:06:13.839 description a Boolean that indicates
01:06:16.240 whether clerk has completed
01:06:18.400 initialization initially it is false and
01:06:21.240 it will become true once clerk loaded
01:06:24.279 and we can check if use is signed in or
01:06:26.880 not then we can get the
01:06:29.960 segments let's say use segments and
01:06:33.680 you're going to see what that means
01:06:35.920 basically it will give you the segments
01:06:38.680 of the current screen so if you're in
01:06:40.960 the home screen if you're in the login
01:06:43.880 screen you know if you're in the
01:06:46.799 notifications so on and so forth we're
01:06:49.599 going to see this in a second and let's
01:06:52.359 say um okay we'll get a router
01:06:57.520 I'll say use router coming from
01:06:59.960 explorator because as you can tell we'll
01:07:02.359 be doing some navigations and here I
01:07:05.799 would like to have a use effect coming
01:07:08.119 from react even though this is react
01:07:10.279 native we can still use react as you can
01:07:13.359 tell we have talked about it previously
01:07:15.720 it is really really similar to react on
01:07:18.400 top of react you just have couple of
01:07:20.680 different concepts right and now in this
01:07:24.680 use effect we would like to check for
01:07:27.480 some stuff so first of all I'll say if
01:07:30.839 clerk is not
01:07:32.599 loaded just return don't do anything and
01:07:36.200 here we can add is
01:07:40.319 loaded we'll say is signed
01:07:43.319 in and we can add the segments so if any
01:07:47.799 of these changes
01:07:50.119 right if any of these changes this use
01:07:53.319 effect should run once again and and now
01:07:56.160 I'll get a variable I'll say if you are
01:07:58.520 in the
01:07:59.520 oath
01:08:02.079 page and this is how we can check for it
01:08:04.680 we'll just say if segments of the first
01:08:07.839 item is equal to oath if this is the
01:08:10.640 case that means we are in the oath page
01:08:13.119 and since we don't really have Pages
01:08:14.880 let's say in oath
01:08:17.439 screen let's say if user is not signed
01:08:20.960 in and if user is not in the oath screen
01:08:25.839 which means they should be navigated to
01:08:28.319 the homepage or to the login page my bad
01:08:32.080 we'll say router. replace take them to
01:08:34.759 the login page and in the same way if
01:08:38.158 they are trying to
01:08:40.040 cheat so let's say else if oops let's
01:08:44.439 say else if user is signed in and if
01:08:48.279 they are still trying to visit the login
01:08:51.560 page we're going to just take them to
01:08:53.520 the homepage right and at the end we'll
01:08:57.080 say if it is not loaded we can just
01:09:02.080 return null or we can return a loader
01:09:06.640 component and here if everything is done
01:09:10.198 successfully we can just return the
01:09:13.839 stack let's get this and we'll just say
01:09:16.479 screen options header shown to be
01:09:19.279 false okay so if user is authenticated
01:09:23.238 and if they visit let's say home screen
01:09:25.839 or if they visit notification screen we
01:09:28.439 are never going to hit any of these if
01:09:30.158 checks we will just take them to the
01:09:32.158 related screen and now we'll go ahead
01:09:35.279 into this layout instead of having this
01:09:37.839 stack we will have the initial layout so
01:09:41.479 previously we had stack as it is but now
01:09:44.719 we have put it here on top of it we have
01:09:47.600 added the authentication logic that will
01:09:50.679 do the navigation so I hope this makes
01:09:53.359 sense
01:09:55.920 let's get the initial
01:09:57.920 layout save it and now here we can see
01:10:01.640 since we are logged in it takes us to
01:10:04.040 the homepage I'll go ahead and
01:10:07.440 refresh like we are by default in the in
01:10:11.400 the home screen even though our index
01:10:14.600 file says take the user to the login
01:10:17.760 right since initial layout runs we are
01:10:21.560 in the actual home screen okay so let's
01:10:25.400 quickly close everything and reiterate
01:10:28.600 what we have done so far then we'll just
01:10:30.560 move on with the next section so we have
01:10:33.000 set it up cler we just need to get some
01:10:35.760 environment variables we need to set up
01:10:38.000 this cache. TS file which is something
01:10:40.520 that we don't really need to understand
01:10:42.280 completely this is something that clerk
01:10:45.480 needs to be able to handle the
01:10:47.159 authentication securely and then we have
01:10:49.880 built a login page with a really cool
01:10:52.560 design and we have added this fun
01:10:55.320 function called handle Google signin
01:10:58.800 where we just use the clerk functions
01:11:01.480 and once you are authenticated we take
01:11:03.640 the user to the homepage and in the
01:11:06.560 initial check we have a component called
01:11:09.400 initial layout that will do the
01:11:12.280 authentication uh navigation right if
01:11:15.120 user is not signed in and if they are
01:11:17.679 not in the oath screen they should be
01:11:20.000 navigated to the oath screen in the else
01:11:23.040 case they should be in the tabs page and
01:11:25.840 if none of these are correct then we're
01:11:29.719 going to hit this return statement where
01:11:31.800 we'll show the related page okay and we
01:11:36.480 have wrapped our entire application with
01:11:39.639 these cler providers and we have the
01:11:42.360 initial layout check in like in the root
01:11:46.280 layout right okay so I hope this makes
01:11:49.280 sense this might look a little bit
01:11:51.280 complicated but if you think about it if
01:11:53.600 you go step by step about this code
01:11:56.480 basee I think it should make sense so I
01:11:59.840 would say pause the video and take a
01:12:01.840 look at the code base try to see what we
01:12:04.040 have done so far it should take around 5
01:12:06.800 minutes and then in the next section
01:12:08.679 we're going to go ahead and integrate a
01:12:10.920 database to our current
01:12:13.360 application all right so this is where
01:12:15.800 we left we have integrated clerk for the
01:12:18.560 authentication and now it is time to
01:12:20.760 have a database and for this we'll be
01:12:23.560 using convex you can find the link in
01:12:25.920 the description they have a free plan
01:12:28.480 that we can use just like clerk so let's
01:12:31.600 go ahead and visit that before we try to
01:12:34.560 log in and create an application just
01:12:37.120 know that convex can be used as your
01:12:39.679 entire back end and actually in this
01:12:42.480 project we'll be using it as our
01:12:44.639 database which works in real time out of
01:12:47.360 the box and we'll be using their file
01:12:50.040 storage to be able to store our files
01:12:53.400 such as such as our post Imes right and
01:12:56.760 there are a couple of different concepts
01:12:58.920 like queries mutations actions so on and
01:13:02.000 so forth we'll get into we'll get into
01:13:05.320 them right so I would like to just go
01:13:07.480 ahead and log
01:13:11.000 in if you don't have an account go ahead
01:13:13.600 and create one uh you don't really need
01:13:15.760 to pay anything once again you can
01:13:18.280 create a project from here but what we
01:13:20.800 would like to do actually create it from
01:13:23.239 the terminal so I'll open up my terminal
01:13:26.040 let's kill this with command or control
01:13:28.800 C and clear this up we would like to say
01:13:31.960 npm
01:13:33.120 install oops let's say npm install
01:13:36.920 convex and by the way you can take a
01:13:39.520 look at the documentation as well let's
01:13:41.800 say documentation. convex
01:13:44.480 DOD they have bunch of different sdks in
01:13:47.679 our case we would like to have react
01:13:49.520 native with Expo so we already have an
01:13:52.520 expo application we would like to just
01:13:54.560 install convex and run this command
01:13:57.840 let's see what this will do in the
01:14:00.679 terminal now that now that we have this
01:14:02.800 ready let's go ahead paste this in if
01:14:05.560 you're using this command for the very
01:14:07.600 first time it will ask you to log in to
01:14:10.360 your conix account but since I am
01:14:13.040 already logged in it asks me to create a
01:14:16.159 new project or choose an existing one I
01:14:19.120 would like to create a new project so
01:14:20.960 I'll just select this press enter now we
01:14:24.480 can give it a name so I'll just say
01:14:26.280 Spotlight app let's just Auto accept
01:14:29.560 that and we would like to deploy this on
01:14:33.159 a cloud I mean CLA environment so I'll
01:14:36.920 just select this one it will go ahead
01:14:39.320 and create a project for us now it says
01:14:42.639 it is ready let's take a look at
01:14:44.920 it there we go in real time it works we
01:14:48.000 got the spotlight application and here
01:14:51.320 we don't really have like any tables but
01:14:54.400 we would like to to create couple of
01:14:56.199 different tables right such as one for
01:14:59.679 users posts
01:15:02.080 notifications likes so on and so forth
01:15:05.719 okay but first we need to handle the
01:15:09.480 authentication as well so what do I mean
01:15:11.960 you might say okay we already handled
01:15:14.080 that right we got the clerk it is
01:15:16.560 working so that's correct but we also
01:15:19.239 need to connect that authentication
01:15:21.320 Service with our database because at the
01:15:24.360 end of the day if you think about it
01:15:26.520 Clerk and convex are two different
01:15:29.280 Services when someone signs up with
01:15:31.960 clerk we need to let our database know
01:15:35.040 about that user so that we can store it
01:15:37.600 in our database so let's try to see in
01:15:41.199 the documentation we are going to take a
01:15:43.520 look at the um authentication
01:15:47.400 specifically with
01:15:49.520 clerk okay so this tells you to go ahead
01:15:53.320 sign up to Clerk this is something that
01:15:55.800 we already done we have created an
01:15:58.280 application and now it says you should
01:16:00.600 create a JWT template so let's go here
01:16:04.199 under the configure and make sure you
01:16:06.400 selected the correct
01:16:08.400 application so configure JWT templates
01:16:12.600 create a new one that is matching with
01:16:16.600 convex okay just copy this isue URL save
01:16:21.920 this and let's take a look at the next
01:16:24.239 step
01:16:25.480 they tell us to create an oath.
01:16:34.280 config.sys it but we got a convex folder
01:16:38.400 which is the place that we're going to
01:16:40.000 put everything related to our database
01:16:43.280 which is convex database right so let's
01:16:45.520 go ahead and first handle the
01:16:46.920 authentication under this oath. config
01:16:49.920 dots file so I will paste what I have
01:16:53.560 copied for a second we'll be using it
01:16:56.880 and copy this entire
01:16:59.719 thing paste it below and we would like
01:17:02.639 to change this part with what we have
01:17:06.040 right here so let's cut it and paste it
01:17:10.600 okay this should be good to go this is
01:17:12.760 something that we had to do around eight
01:17:15.520 lines of code let's close this file
01:17:18.480 let's see the next step okay they tell
01:17:21.000 you that you should be running this now
01:17:23.679 to be able to deploy your changes but we
01:17:26.639 already have this open right now it just
01:17:29.520 says convex functions are
01:17:31.920 ready so keep this in mind from here and
01:17:35.040 out until the end of this tutorial you
01:17:37.679 would like to have two different
01:17:39.320 terminals open one would be running this
01:17:42.840 npx convex Dev so every single time we
01:17:46.440 should have this npx convex St running
01:17:50.159 because when we add a function that is
01:17:53.360 related to our database it will deploy
01:17:56.199 our changes to convex and then we are
01:17:59.920 going to run our application with npx
01:18:03.840 Expo right I'll just run this in a
01:18:06.400 second but first let's see the other
01:18:08.679 steps so here this is the uh guide for
01:18:13.920 uh clerk react but in our case we are
01:18:16.360 using Expo so we don't really need to
01:18:18.639 install this I believe let's try to see
01:18:21.400 how we can make this work um like they
01:18:24.880 can like you can see in the main. TSX
01:18:28.280 they wrap the entire application with
01:18:30.600 clerk provider as well as convex
01:18:33.280 provider with clerk so let's try to do
01:18:35.840 this but instead of app we would like to
01:18:38.960 wrap our layout right our entire
01:18:43.520 application so I know this might sound
01:18:45.679 complicated but let's just try to see it
01:18:48.440 I would like to wrap or I would like to
01:18:51.800 create a folder called providers
01:18:55.120 to keep our code Base clean and I will
01:18:57.840 say Clerk and convex
01:19:02.920 provider.
01:19:04.480 TSX so basically instead of having this
01:19:08.600 clerk um logic here I would like to take
01:19:12.120 this and put it into it into its own
01:19:14.880 file so let's try to build this file
01:19:18.760 I'm so let's try to build this file I
01:19:21.880 promise it'll make 100% sense so I'll
01:19:25.120 just say rnf to get this code let's
01:19:28.480 delete this Imports we can delete this
01:19:31.239 return statement instead of a VI we'll
01:19:34.719 like to get the clerk provider which is
01:19:37.600 going to be coming from clerk Expo and
01:19:40.080 this is exact same thing what we have
01:19:41.840 done here we would like to get the token
01:19:45.080 as well as the publishable key let's try
01:19:47.960 to import these basically I'll just cut
01:19:50.920 this from here get it and then let's get
01:19:54.719 the token cache get the clerk provider
01:19:58.280 okay now inside of this instead of just
01:20:01.239 having the clerk loaded we would like to
01:20:03.840 have the convex provider as well so say
01:20:07.120 convex provider with clerk I think it
01:20:11.120 should be provider with
01:20:14.719 clerk just like this and we will be
01:20:17.719 importing this from
01:20:21.199 here okay now this gives us an error
01:20:25.639 because if you take a look at the
01:20:27.719 documentation this takes a client as
01:20:30.360 well as a use oath so let's try to add
01:20:34.280 those here I'll just say use oath here
01:20:37.920 will get the use oath from clerk Expo
01:20:40.920 then we'll like to add a client let's
01:20:43.800 try to create it above I will copy this
01:20:47.440 so this is coming from
01:20:49.920 documentation um convex react client
01:20:52.920 should be coming from
01:20:55.480 convex react okay just like this let's
01:20:58.840 try to import it there we go and we are
01:21:02.040 using uh public convex URL this is
01:21:05.960 coming from the env. local when we run
01:21:09.400 this command in our terminal we got
01:21:12.040 these environment variables okay just
01:21:14.679 keep that in mind I forgot to show you
01:21:16.600 this but these are the things that we
01:21:18.400 have in the EnV
01:21:21.440 file
01:21:22.960 okay then we'll go ah head and add this
01:21:25.639 convex client right here then we can
01:21:29.080 just say once clerk is
01:21:32.000 loaded we can wrap our children with it
01:21:35.960 and this children will be coming here as
01:21:39.360 a prop we can say children will be type
01:21:42.360 of react node so what we have done so
01:21:45.480 far is basically we took this entire
01:21:48.960 part put it into its own file into its
01:21:53.000 own component and on top of it we have
01:21:55.679 integrated convex with it right so we
01:21:58.960 can basically go ahead delete this part
01:22:01.880 completely we can delete the token cache
01:22:04.800 these Imports and we can wrap our
01:22:08.199 application with the clerk and convex
01:22:10.960 provider that we have just created now
01:22:14.199 in our entire application we can have
01:22:17.560 the clerk and convex working
01:22:20.920 together and we have take this logic put
01:22:24.520 put it into its own file so that our
01:22:26.960 code base is a lot more readable and it
01:22:30.480 is like
01:22:33.320 organized okay so with this in mind
01:22:35.880 let's try to delete this stack and save
01:22:38.440 this
01:22:39.679 file all right so we are making a really
01:22:42.760 good progress so far we have integrated
01:22:45.360 authentication as well as a database now
01:22:48.400 you might feel like we are going a bit
01:22:50.199 slowly that's correct but we are
01:22:52.480 actually building a real word app
01:22:54.480 application right so we just need to
01:22:56.840 take care of every single step slowly so
01:22:59.719 that we all understand everything that
01:23:01.960 we do now we have database as well as as
01:23:06.159 well as authentication system it is time
01:23:08.679 to maybe just go ahead and Define our
01:23:11.880 tables so I have said we're going to
01:23:14.040 have tables for users posts comments so
01:23:18.320 and and so forth right and since it is
01:23:20.920 related to our database we're going to
01:23:23.159 go into the convex folder
01:23:25.159 and we will Define our schema so let's
01:23:27.960 say schema. TS this is a special file
01:23:31.320 that will make our codebase to be uh
01:23:34.560 type safe so if you don't know what that
01:23:36.480 means it'll basically give us Auto
01:23:39.360 completions so that we don't really have
01:23:41.440 any errors in our code so it'll just be
01:23:43.840 type save as the name suggests all right
01:23:46.679 so let's just try to see how we can
01:23:48.800 Define our tables how we can Define our
01:23:51.520 schema I'll say export default and let
01:23:54.320 me me Shing the left hand side we're
01:23:56.400 going to say Define schema which is a
01:24:00.239 function let's say let me just delete
01:24:03.360 this this is a function coming from
01:24:05.920 convex I don't know why it did not
01:24:08.080 import it by default but it should be
01:24:10.560 coming from convex server this will take
01:24:13.560 an object and here we can Define our
01:24:16.280 tables the first table that I'd like to
01:24:18.960 have will be users so we just say users
01:24:22.800 Define table
01:24:25.480 say Define table just like this it'll be
01:24:28.600 coming from the same import from convex
01:24:31.800 server this is a function that we're
01:24:34.000 going to call and we're going to put an
01:24:35.800 object with the fields that we' like to
01:24:38.040 have so each user will have a username
01:24:41.760 and this is going to be type of string
01:24:44.280 but this is how we can do it we'll just
01:24:46.040 say v. string and we need to get this V
01:24:49.760 from convex values which is our
01:24:53.080 validator okay then each user will have
01:24:56.040 a full name so let's say v. string as
01:24:58.920 well so if this is something like a
01:25:01.639 jandoo this will be the full name
01:25:04.080 version of it like this then we'll like
01:25:07.280 to have email for every single user oops
01:25:10.520 let's say v. string every single user
01:25:13.480 will have a bio but this could be
01:25:16.119 optional right so I might not have any
01:25:20.159 bio so I can just say v. optional and it
01:25:23.760 will be type type of
01:25:25.840 string then each user will have an image
01:25:29.119 this could be optional but since users
01:25:31.280 are logging in with Google they will
01:25:33.960 have an image anyways so I'll just
01:25:36.199 remove the optional field and let's say
01:25:39.440 each user will have some followers which
01:25:42.280 is going to be say v. number we'll just
01:25:45.920 store this as a value in the same way we
01:25:48.639 will have number of
01:25:50.480 followings and in the same way we will
01:25:52.920 have the number of posts
01:25:54.920 then finally I would like to get a field
01:25:57.920 called clor ID which will be type of
01:26:01.000 string now why do we store clerk ID in
01:26:04.119 the users table so if you think about it
01:26:07.480 Clerk and convex are two different
01:26:09.920 Services right we have talked about this
01:26:12.880 when we authenticate with clerk when we
01:26:16.000 sign up with clerk we will save the same
01:26:18.639 user to our database so let's say we got
01:26:21.719 the user that has just signed up with
01:26:23.840 Clerk we would like to save it to our
01:26:26.119 database and we would like to keep a
01:26:28.560 reference to this user so we will just
01:26:31.159 add a clerk ID what it corresponds in
01:26:34.239 the clerk service right and this is the
01:26:37.719 field how we can do it when user signs
01:26:40.880 up we will add the clerk ID of this user
01:26:43.679 and by default users will have a field
01:26:47.360 called underscore ID this will be given
01:26:50.119 by convex so if you have used mongodb
01:26:53.560 previously it would do the same thing so
01:26:56.440 here uh convex doeses the same thing and
01:26:59.719 it gives you a creation time field as
01:27:03.400 well by default which is the created at
01:27:07.159 date okay now we would like to add some
01:27:10.639 indexes which would help us for the
01:27:13.520 querying later in the video so we can
01:27:15.960 just get a user by their clerk ID right
01:27:19.119 so I can just say add an index you can
01:27:21.679 call this anything I'll call this as a
01:27:23.600 buy clerk ID and the field that we would
01:27:27.119 like to querry with will be clerk ID so
01:27:30.520 basically later in the video we'll say
01:27:32.880 hey give us a user so let's say an
01:27:35.880 example let's say get user
01:27:39.159 by clerk ID okay let's just get this
01:27:44.360 let's say we're going to call a function
01:27:46.920 uh we're going to put the clerk ID let's
01:27:48.679 say it is one two three and it will give
01:27:50.840 us the user with this clerk ID I hope
01:27:54.800 that makes sense basically index is used
01:27:57.520 to have some quering it'll just make it
01:28:00.719 faster and then we can we can add our
01:28:03.800 other tables so I would like to just
01:28:07.119 grab and paste them uh one by one and
01:28:10.840 I'd like to walk you through it line by
01:28:13.040 line okay so we have the posts table
01:28:16.719 just like what we have here we will
01:28:18.480 Define a table each post will have a
01:28:21.280 user ID this is the owner of the post
01:28:24.639 then each post will have an image URL
01:28:27.520 because this is an application like
01:28:30.159 Instagram we have to have an image and
01:28:33.440 we would like to store a storage ID now
01:28:36.400 this will be needed when you want to
01:28:38.400 delete a post and the type of this will
01:28:41.360 be storage ID this is something that
01:28:43.679 we'll get later in the video and here
01:28:46.040 the user ID if you have realized is type
01:28:48.560 of V uh like user ID if you delete this
01:28:51.960 part you can see it should be type save
01:28:55.440 um currently it
01:28:56.800 isn't I don't know maybe in this schema
01:28:59.320 we don't really get it but in other
01:29:00.880 files we will actually get that then
01:29:03.920 each post will have a caption but it'll
01:29:06.400 be optional so you don't really need to
01:29:08.159 add a caption and we're going to store
01:29:10.360 the number of likes as well as comments
01:29:12.960 then we're going to get like we're going
01:29:14.679 to add an index where we'll just say hey
01:29:17.679 give us a post by user and we're going
01:29:20.560 to pass the user ID it'll give us the
01:29:22.760 post that match with that user ID so if
01:29:26.000 this index stuff doesn't make sense once
01:29:28.360 we use them I think it'll be
01:29:30.960 clear okay then we'll like to store the
01:29:34.480 comments right I'll just put the
01:29:37.119 comments table let's define it each
01:29:39.639 comment will have an author which will
01:29:42.440 be the user ID and each comment will be
01:29:45.400 made on a post right so it will be
01:29:47.600 related with a post we just put those
01:29:50.719 types those fields and then we add the
01:29:54.040 comment content itself and again we just
01:29:57.000 add a query then we'll like to store the
01:30:00.520 number of likes right or like I should
01:30:04.440 say we are going to have a likes table
01:30:07.280 and I'll just put it above the
01:30:09.320 comments let's put a comma here okay
01:30:12.840 we'll have a table called likes whenever
01:30:16.040 we like a post we're going to create a
01:30:19.000 like document which will have a user ID
01:30:21.960 and post ID user ID is the one liked
01:30:26.320 right so it is the author and the post
01:30:29.040 ID means which post that we have liked
01:30:32.280 then we can add some indexes now please
01:30:35.360 let me just grab those we should be able
01:30:38.159 to query a like with the post ID
01:30:43.080 and um so I should say and then we
01:30:45.719 should be able to get with the user and
01:30:48.239 post 8 so once again if this doesn't
01:30:50.639 make sense I think it should be really
01:30:53.080 really clear when we when we reach to
01:30:56.600 the end of the tutorial because we'll be
01:30:58.520 using the these
01:30:59.920 indexes um and it should be really
01:31:02.360 really clear then let's get the follows
01:31:05.719 table in the same way we would like to
01:31:07.960 have couple of different indexes let me
01:31:10.560 go ahead and put it
01:31:12.239 below so we are defining another table
01:31:15.360 where we have a follower ID and
01:31:17.440 following ID so let's say we have two
01:31:19.800 different users John and Jane
01:31:24.440 now if John let's say JN follows Jane
01:31:29.239 that means JN is following and sorry JN
01:31:34.400 is the follower right it follows the
01:31:36.560 Jane and Jane is the following when JN
01:31:39.960 follows the chain we will create a
01:31:41.960 follow document we will say follower ID
01:31:45.560 we will put the John's ID and following
01:31:48.080 ID would be the chains ID now I'm just
01:31:51.119 explaining it really slowly it might be
01:31:53.480 your very first time building a social
01:31:55.400 media application so I feel like I had
01:31:57.560 to explain it then we add a couple of
01:32:00.159 different indexes that we'll be using
01:32:02.080 later in the video okay then we would
01:32:04.800 like to keep track of the notifications
01:32:07.239 so when you like a post or when you
01:32:10.199 comment on a post or when you follow
01:32:13.159 someone you would like to send a
01:32:15.440 notification so let's create this table
01:32:18.159 I will say notifications Define a table
01:32:21.239 with these fields so each notification
01:32:24.199 will have a receiver as well as a sender
01:32:27.119 and we will store them as IDs Now
01:32:30.040 notifications will have three different
01:32:32.280 types either like comment or follow so
01:32:36.440 you could simply go ahead just say v.
01:32:39.520 string this is also acceptable but just
01:32:42.320 to make our code a little bit more clean
01:32:44.800 we can just force this right we'll say
01:32:47.159 it'll be Union
01:32:48.679 type and it will be one of them so v.
01:32:52.800 literal it could be either like comment
01:32:56.199 or follow then the like it will have two
01:33:00.040 different fields one post ID and one
01:33:03.159 comment ID now these are optional it is
01:33:06.080 because if it is a follow notification
01:33:09.080 it is not related to any post so it's
01:33:11.400 not going to have any post ID and it
01:33:13.360 will not have a comment ID as well but
01:33:15.600 if it is a like or if it is a comment
01:33:18.440 notification it will have these fields
01:33:22.600 right and and here once again we add an
01:33:25.920 index so we have one last table let me
01:33:29.719 save to get this formatting and by the
01:33:32.280 way whenever you save it will take a
01:33:35.679 look at this file and try to deploy your
01:33:38.360 functions to your convex
01:33:41.159 dashboard okay so the very last table
01:33:44.800 that we'll have will be bookmarks let me
01:33:47.080 just paste it whenever we bookmark a
01:33:49.880 post we will create a bookmark do
01:33:53.000 document with these fields okay so I can
01:33:56.560 definitely feel this might feel a little
01:33:58.840 bit overwhelming but basically these are
01:34:02.199 the tables that we'll have in this
01:34:04.239 tutorial in this project and we'll be
01:34:06.639 using these
01:34:08.320 indexes okay let's save and take a look
01:34:12.800 at our
01:34:16.320 dashboard if you like if you say
01:34:19.800 generate schema I don't know why we
01:34:21.800 didn't get that but let's refresh this
01:34:23.560 page
01:34:24.840 page okay so I think I have visited the
01:34:29.000 production um I should be visiting the
01:34:31.960 development right let's take a look at
01:34:33.920 this instance if you take a look at the
01:34:36.080 data you should be able to see all the
01:34:38.480 fields like all the tables that we have
01:34:41.199 and if you say show
01:34:42.760 schema like this is crazy the code that
01:34:45.639 we have just written in our local
01:34:47.920 machine is now accessible on the web in
01:34:50.960 the convex dashboard so the these are
01:34:54.480 this is the code that we have just
01:34:56.000 written and in the same way we should be
01:34:58.639 able to see our functions right here but
01:35:01.760 currently we don't really have any
01:35:03.239 functions which is something that we'll
01:35:05.560 build next so I have just said we're
01:35:08.760 going to build some functions and
01:35:11.000 specifically convex functions now you
01:35:13.520 might be asking what is a convex
01:35:15.360 function well basically any operation
01:35:18.119 that we need that is related to our back
01:35:20.440 end for our database we're going to
01:35:23.080 build a function to give you some
01:35:25.239 examples let's say if you want to get
01:35:28.000 some posts right if you want to do a get
01:35:30.760 request we're going to be writing a
01:35:32.800 function called query and it will you
01:35:35.920 know give us some response so here it'll
01:35:38.920 return us the posts and in the same way
01:35:41.560 we have a different type of function
01:35:43.679 called mutation where we can use this
01:35:46.159 for create update and delete operations
01:35:49.800 and here are some examples if you wanted
01:35:52.119 to create a post we're going to build a
01:35:55.040 mutation if you wanted to update a
01:35:57.639 comment we're going to build a mutation
01:35:59.639 and in the same way if you want to
01:36:01.040 delete a post we're going to build a
01:36:02.960 mutation for it so the first uh mutation
01:36:06.040 that I'd like to build is to create a
01:36:08.760 user right let's say create user this is
01:36:12.159 going to be a mutation that will write
01:36:14.239 in our convex back end and you might be
01:36:17.239 asking why this is the case so let's
01:36:19.639 just take a look at it on a diagram So
01:36:22.119 currently this is the state of our
01:36:24.119 application we just signed up with clerk
01:36:27.000 right we have the user under our clerk
01:36:29.880 dashboard but we don't really have a
01:36:31.960 user in our database right if you take a
01:36:34.600 look at it we don't really have this
01:36:36.199 user so we need to take that user and
01:36:39.639 create it in our database as well and
01:36:42.159 how can we make this happen well there
01:36:44.360 is a concept called Web hooks which is
01:36:46.960 something really really important for
01:36:48.760 you to understand this is not specific
01:36:50.960 to react native or this is not specific
01:36:53.719 to this application only this is a
01:36:56.639 general concept every web developer
01:36:59.000 should know so let's just see what they
01:37:01.239 are in the first place they are
01:37:03.280 automated messages that are sent when
01:37:05.840 something happens and in our case that
01:37:08.400 something is when a user created so
01:37:11.679 we'll say hey convex when a user signed
01:37:14.719 up just send us an event to our database
01:37:18.119 we're going to take that user and save
01:37:20.280 it to our database right so there is an
01:37:23.280 event event that clerk has called user
01:37:26.199 created and we are going to listen for
01:37:28.639 this event and this will send only once
01:37:31.600 for every single user because they can
01:37:34.040 only sign up once and like later they
01:37:37.360 can just only log in so I hope that
01:37:39.840 makes sense it will send us an event
01:37:42.560 that is called user created and with
01:37:45.119 this event they will also send the user
01:37:47.320 information such as their full name
01:37:50.480 email uh profile image
01:37:53.599 username so on and so forth and we're
01:37:55.760 going to take this user and save it to
01:37:57.840 our database and let's let's try to
01:38:01.159 create that function called create user
01:38:03.960 so I'll just visit vs code let's kill
01:38:07.199 everything under the convex I will
01:38:09.679 create a file called users. yes and
01:38:13.320 everything that is related to users
01:38:15.440 table we're going to put it here on this
01:38:18.520 file and let me just show you the
01:38:20.599 documentation as well so I'll just say
01:38:22.960 conve
01:38:24.719 functions let's go here take a look at
01:38:26.960 it just in case if you wanted to check
01:38:29.040 this out after completing this tutorial
01:38:31.560 so just remember that everything is
01:38:33.360 actually coming from the documentation
01:38:35.719 so here we can see there are three types
01:38:37.840 of functions that I have mentioned one
01:38:40.199 of them are queries then mutations and
01:38:43.119 also there are actions and you would use
01:38:45.440 actions when you are talking with third
01:38:48.040 party services such as stripe open AI so
01:38:51.239 on and so forth now let's just try to to
01:38:53.520 build our very first mutation so this is
01:38:56.400 the like syntax that they would give you
01:38:59.400 let's just copy it I will paste it into
01:39:01.719 vs code but we're going to obviously
01:39:03.880 change it okay well let's actually
01:39:07.040 delete everything that we have currently
01:39:09.719 just I don't know why I copied it but
01:39:12.800 let's go ahead try to build it from
01:39:14.719 scratch so we have a function you can
01:39:17.239 call this anything in my case I'll say
01:39:19.719 create user this is going to be a
01:39:22.320 mutation which is a function that we
01:39:24.360 call and it takes an argument so here we
01:39:27.440 can take some arcs let's just say if we
01:39:30.360 wanted to create a user user should have
01:39:33.080 couple of different fields one of them
01:39:35.159 is username and if you want to see all
01:39:37.400 the fields that we have these are the
01:39:39.480 things that we should take as an
01:39:41.760 argument right so let me just get them
01:39:44.840 pretty quickly we're going to get the
01:39:46.599 full name for the user because I think
01:39:48.960 this is what we have in the schema then
01:39:51.320 we are going to have an image going to
01:39:53.800 have a bio so these are type of strings
01:39:57.080 this is also type of string but there is
01:39:59.320 one thing this is optional right when
01:40:01.520 user signs up they'll not have a bio so
01:40:04.360 we're going to add the email as well and
01:40:06.880 finally the clerk ID now this is not
01:40:09.440 really happy with us because we need to
01:40:11.280 add a Handler function that will do the
01:40:14.239 logic so let's say async this is going
01:40:16.599 to take the context as the first
01:40:19.199 argument and then we're going to take
01:40:21.000 the
01:40:21.800 arcs now you might say what is this
01:40:24.760 context is all about so by using this
01:40:27.599 context you can interact with your
01:40:29.639 database as well as check the
01:40:32.000 authentication and with this arcs you're
01:40:34.320 able to access to these arcs basically
01:40:38.040 so let's go ahead and just say await so
01:40:40.840 basically we are trying to create a user
01:40:44.080 in database so we'll say await context.
01:40:48.159 db. insert let's just find it and we
01:40:51.960 would like to insert something into the
01:40:54.040 users table and here you can see it is
01:40:56.560 type save right if you press control
01:40:58.440 space you can see all the tables that we
01:41:00.719 have we would like to go under the users
01:41:02.960 table and we're going to add all these
01:41:05.080 fields that we have such as username
01:41:07.800 full name let me just accept everything
01:41:11.239 so these are the arguments that we have
01:41:14.239 above right and on top of these we would
01:41:17.040 like to add the default Fields such as
01:41:19.840 the number of followers following and
01:41:22.239 posts when users sign up by default they
01:41:25.920 will be zero okay now just before we
01:41:29.480 create the user we need to check if it
01:41:31.520 is already existed right because there
01:41:34.320 might be some mistakes and this function
01:41:36.520 might be called twice for a user so
01:41:39.480 we're going to check if a user existed
01:41:42.080 already or
01:41:43.400 not and let's do it I'll just say well
01:41:47.040 actually before we assign it I'll just
01:41:48.679 say await context. DB we would like to
01:41:52.760 query something under the user table and
01:41:55.960 we're going to query it with an index so
01:41:58.840 I'll just go here I'll say dot with
01:42:01.119 index and we have created an index
01:42:03.880 called by clerk ID and these are the
01:42:07.000 other indexes that clerk gives you so if
01:42:10.199 you take a look at the schema this is
01:42:12.400 the index that we have added under the
01:42:14.280 users table so we're going to say with
01:42:16.679 index called by clerk ID and here we are
01:42:19.760 going to pass a callback function where
01:42:22.760 we will take the query so we'll say
01:42:24.960 query. equal to clerk ID if it is equal
01:42:28.800 to this argument and this is going to
01:42:31.679 give us a result where we can fetch it
01:42:33.719 with first or unique so it's the same
01:42:37.199 thing I'll go with first and we will
01:42:39.840 assign this to a variable called
01:42:42.199 existing user just like
01:42:45.920 this and I will say if existing user
01:42:50.400 right if we have a user just return and
01:42:52.760 don't do anything but if user is not
01:42:55.360 existed we're going to go ahead and
01:42:57.119 create the user in the database so I
01:43:00.000 hope this makes sense now we able to see
01:43:02.679 how to create an index as well as consum
01:43:05.320 it we basically uh we basically get a
01:43:09.400 user with the clerk ID and this clerk ID
01:43:12.440 is coming from the arguments okay so we
01:43:15.520 have created this function but how can
01:43:17.840 we call it right we just talked about it
01:43:20.520 on a diagram when someone signs up with
01:43:23.159 with clerk clerk needs to send us this
01:43:26.239 uh webbook event so we just need to set
01:43:28.719 this up and you can take a look at it
01:43:30.840 from the documentation but let me just
01:43:32.920 walk you through it we'll go under the
01:43:35.280 dashboard under the
01:43:37.280 configure we just need to find the web
01:43:40.360 hooks so where is that I
01:43:43.679 think so for some reason I cannot see it
01:43:46.520 let's search for it web hooks okay there
01:43:48.800 we go under the
01:43:51.639 developers we would like to add a
01:43:54.360 webbook and specifically an endpoint so
01:43:58.280 let's say uh to be able to add this
01:44:00.800 endpoint we just need to get our convex
01:44:03.480 URL under the. EnV so I will go ahead
01:44:07.360 copy this entire thing called convex URL
01:44:10.800 and just go here paste it now if you are
01:44:13.880 adding an endpoint for web hook instead
01:44:16.840 of saying Cloud this should be site and
01:44:20.119 you might say how do you know this well
01:44:22.239 basically once again from the
01:44:24.159 documentation let's say HTTP actions
01:44:26.920 convex there we go they tell you that
01:44:30.199 you should use site at the end okay and
01:44:33.840 then there should be an endo that I'd
01:44:36.040 like to listen I'll just call this as
01:44:38.080 clerk web hook you can call this
01:44:40.440 anything literally like hello but it
01:44:43.480 shouldn't like it should make sense
01:44:45.320 right so I'll just say clerk web Hook
01:44:47.560 and the event that I would like to
01:44:48.960 listen to here we can see we have all
01:44:51.760 bunch of like all kinds kind of events
01:44:54.239 but I'd like to listen for user. created
01:44:57.760 okay I'll just go ahead add
01:45:01.119 this and we just got a signing secret so
01:45:04.840 this is really important we should copy
01:45:06.960 this and add this as an environment
01:45:09.960 variable now instead of adding it into
01:45:12.239 the EnV file we will go ahead and add it
01:45:15.199 into our convex dashboard so under the
01:45:18.400 settings under the environment variables
01:45:21.360 we're going to say Clerk book secret and
01:45:24.599 add this value in your case it will be
01:45:27.599 different please use your own because I
01:45:30.000 will delete mine uh before I publish
01:45:32.679 this video let's go ahead and save it
01:45:36.280 okay so now that we have set this up
01:45:38.239 let's go ahead write some code to make
01:45:40.639 this work and I I need to mention
01:45:43.960 something when clerk send us an event we
01:45:47.320 are going to take the user and save it
01:45:49.320 to the database but now think about it
01:45:52.159 everyone can send you this kind of an
01:45:54.520 event right we could have a malicious
01:45:56.840 user it like it'll just send you this
01:45:59.480 event millions of times and in that case
01:46:02.119 you just need to make sure that this
01:46:04.199 event is actually coming from clerk so
01:46:07.480 with this in mind let's try to write our
01:46:10.239 code so I will create a file called HTTP
01:46:14.760 dots and we're going to build the logic
01:46:18.320 in this file so I would like to get in
01:46:21.760 like get a package
01:46:23.560 let me just say npm install
01:46:26.679 svix which is used to verify web hooks
01:46:30.880 okay so let's wait for this to be
01:46:32.960 installed there we go we just got
01:46:36.159 that and I don't have the X application
01:46:39.360 running but I'll just run this in a
01:46:41.119 second let's try to build this file
01:46:43.679 first now first I'll get couple of
01:46:45.800 different imports from convex and we're
01:46:48.599 going to get this web Hook from SV
01:46:51.000 package so let's create a router I'll
01:46:54.080 say const
01:46:56.159 HTTP HTTP router and we're going to call
01:46:59.320 this now I promise this code will make
01:47:02.080 sense once we complete this file just
01:47:04.560 for a couple of minutes bear with me so
01:47:07.000 we'll say HTTP do route we are going to
01:47:11.000 create a route and this will take an
01:47:13.239 object where we'll say path will be
01:47:15.760 equal to what we have just created which
01:47:18.840 was Slash clerk SL web hook so if you
01:47:22.360 have created this something you should
01:47:24.880 put that name in my case this is what I
01:47:28.199 have done right clerk D web
01:47:31.040 hook um let's go back and then the
01:47:34.760 method type it'll be post as well as the
01:47:37.800 Handler function so this is the logic
01:47:40.880 that we're going to
01:47:42.080 put and I'll just put it in line if you
01:47:45.040 want it to you can create a function
01:47:46.719 outside but it is not really important
01:47:49.560 this is not how it'll look like let's
01:47:51.320 say it will be in http be action where
01:47:54.199 we'll take a callback function just like
01:47:56.719 this I believe and instead of calling
01:47:58.800 this wreck I'll just call it as request
01:48:01.920 okay now let's go ahead and create our
01:48:04.119 function logic so first things first we
01:48:06.639 just need to check for the environment
01:48:08.880 variable if it existed or not let's say
01:48:11.280 con web hook secret let me just copy
01:48:14.800 this and paste it because I'm really
01:48:16.360 slow typer and I don't really want to
01:48:18.400 waste too much time so we go under the
01:48:20.840 process. EMV and search for Clark web
01:48:23.920 hook secret and you just need to make
01:48:25.679 sure that this is matching with what you
01:48:28.920 have typed here right it should be
01:48:30.880 exactly the same otherwise it will be
01:48:33.199 undefined and here we'll just say if
01:48:35.599 this web web hook secret is undefined
01:48:38.239 we'll just throw an error and then we
01:48:40.960 just need to check for the headers so as
01:48:43.840 I've said we just need to make sure that
01:48:45.679 this web Hook is coming from clerk so
01:48:48.280 let's go ahead and first check the
01:48:50.599 headers so in this request headers there
01:48:53.679 will be svx ID signature as well as the
01:48:57.239 Tim stamp and if any of these values are
01:49:00.560 undefined then we're going to throw in
01:49:03.159 error just like this or the response
01:49:05.599 will be 400 and we'll just say like no
01:49:09.480 SV headers found but if we have the
01:49:12.679 headers we can go ahead do something
01:49:15.400 else we're going to get the payload from
01:49:17.880 the request and we're going to get the
01:49:20.400 body out of it just like this and then
01:49:23.520 we'll like to create a web hook so I'll
01:49:26.040 just say const web hook we're going to
01:49:28.520 call this um class that we have just
01:49:32.400 above and we're going to put the web
01:49:34.719 hook Secret in it then let's just say
01:49:37.480 let event this could be type of any uh
01:49:40.960 for now let's just leave it as it is and
01:49:43.040 we'll be using this event now I'll have
01:49:45.400 a try and catch block here I'll just say
01:49:48.599 verify the web hook and this this is how
01:49:53.119 we can verify it let me please go ahead
01:49:55.840 and get this so we say uh web hook.
01:49:59.320 verify here is our body and here are the
01:50:02.560 headers if this is if this doesn't throw
01:50:06.400 any errors which means it is verified
01:50:08.719 successfully but if it throws some
01:50:11.199 errors it'll hit the catch block where
01:50:13.840 we'll get the error and throw a response
01:50:17.320 okay so so far what we have done is to
01:50:20.639 check for the environment variable check
01:50:23.000 for the headers and verify the web hook
01:50:26.480 okay so this is what we have done if
01:50:28.360 everything went well so far we can go
01:50:31.239 ahead and actually save user to the
01:50:33.920 database and I would like to get the
01:50:36.320 event type from this uh EVT that we have
01:50:40.199 just created above and here we can see I
01:50:43.280 was going to say this should be type
01:50:44.840 save we can make it just in a second
01:50:47.520 let's say event.
01:50:49.960 type and we'll just check for it so I'll
01:50:52.960 say if so I have just accidentally
01:50:55.159 paused the video let's move on I was
01:50:57.079 going to say if event type is equal to
01:50:59.760 user. created we are going to run this
01:51:02.719 uh block where we can go ahead grab all
01:51:05.679 these fields that we have coming from
01:51:07.840 clerk so we'll basically destructure it
01:51:10.440 from event. data we are getting the ID
01:51:13.560 now here we have email addresses but
01:51:15.800 we're going to take the primary one so
01:51:18.360 here is how we can do it we'll just say
01:51:20.880 con email because in a clerk account
01:51:24.320 user might have bunch of different email
01:51:26.679 addresses we're going to get the primary
01:51:29.239 one right and then we can get the full
01:51:32.119 name so they have the first name and
01:51:34.480 last name we can combine them together
01:51:37.239 right and then we can basically run a
01:51:40.119 mutation oops let me just go back we'll
01:51:43.360 have a try catch Block in the try I'll
01:51:46.159 say a wait context. run mutation and
01:51:50.480 here we'll just say API this is
01:51:52.599 something that we have in uh imported
01:51:54.639 previously this is coming from the
01:51:56.639 generated folder from convex and this is
01:51:59.920 a folder that you don't really need to
01:52:01.719 think about this is something that
01:52:03.960 convex created for us already that will
01:52:07.360 allows us to interact with our database
01:52:10.599 I hope that makes sense we cut the API
01:52:13.679 and from here we'll say
01:52:15.960 api. users here we can see this type
01:52:18.880 save and we can say create user so we're
01:52:21.880 going to call this mutation with some
01:52:24.000 arguments such as the email that we have
01:52:27.599 above we can put it either like this or
01:52:30.520 we can just shorten it this is what I'll
01:52:32.320 be doing we will just add the full name
01:52:34.800 which is the name that we have created
01:52:36.719 above and we're going to put the image
01:52:39.560 which is going to be the image URL
01:52:41.360 coming from clerk now we can get the
01:52:43.960 clerk ID as well as the username so
01:52:47.960 let's say username and how can we create
01:52:50.840 the username for this so so this is what
01:52:53.159 I'll be doing let's imagine the email of
01:52:55.920 the user is equal to Chando gmail.com I
01:53:00.040 will go ahead and get this as the
01:53:02.400 username and let's do it with the split
01:53:05.079 method I'll say
01:53:08.440 email.it with the add symbol and grab
01:53:11.880 the first value right it will be this
01:53:14.880 part I hope that makes sense and in the
01:53:17.639 catch we can console log and error just
01:53:20.639 like that and throw a response with
01:53:23.960 status code of 500 but if everything
01:53:27.119 went well right if we don't really have
01:53:29.679 any errors so far we can return a
01:53:33.400 response where we can say webbook
01:53:35.360 processed successfully and here is the
01:53:37.639 status code okay so I hope now this
01:53:40.639 function or this file is making a little
01:53:44.040 bit of sense so what we have done we got
01:53:46.920 some imports created an HTTP router that
01:53:50.719 we are listening on this path with with
01:53:52.679 this post method and here is the
01:53:55.000 function logic that we're going to run
01:53:57.239 we will take the context as well as the
01:53:59.239 request first we just need to make sure
01:54:01.760 that this event is coming from Clerk and
01:54:04.599 we have a bunch of different really cool
01:54:06.800 checks so that our code looks clean and
01:54:09.599 everything would work properly so we
01:54:12.199 check for the headers check for the
01:54:13.920 environment variable we verify the web
01:54:16.880 hook just like this and for this we have
01:54:19.560 used a package called svx because this
01:54:22.639 is something what uh clerk uses as well
01:54:26.040 so that's why we have to use it this is
01:54:28.040 the web hook infrastructure and then we
01:54:31.159 have verified the web hook successfully
01:54:33.520 we check for that event that we have
01:54:35.560 mentioned previously extract the user
01:54:38.560 data and save it to our database now
01:54:41.679 let's go ahead delete the user from
01:54:44.480 clerk
01:54:46.239 dashboard and we'll try to sign up from
01:54:48.920 scratch let's say delete the user and
01:54:51.679 maybe before we we delete that user
01:54:54.159 let's try to sign out I'll say MPX Expo
01:54:59.159 and I will open up my simulator let's
01:55:01.880 say R uh maybe I should press I first
01:55:06.119 okay it has been like created let's say
01:55:09.280 R okay why is this not
01:55:13.960 working okay so I just close that
01:55:16.480 application press I now with this
01:55:18.800 bundling we should be able to see our
01:55:21.119 application and let me let me actually
01:55:22.960 show you how we can log out I will go
01:55:25.800 into the home screen which was index
01:55:28.520 under the tabs um here instead of this
01:55:31.840 link let's just say we going to have a
01:55:35.480 um I don't know let's just say touchable
01:55:40.480 opacity let's give it some Styles let's
01:55:44.239 say we don't really have this button but
01:55:47.760 let's put it in line I'll just say color
01:55:51.000 do we have color no we don't all right
01:55:53.880 so here I'll just put a
01:55:56.159 text okay just wait a second this look
01:55:58.800 messy but we'll make it work let's say
01:56:01.360 sign out I will take this
01:56:04.320 Styles put it and here I'll just say
01:56:07.119 color will
01:56:09.199 be okay what am I doing it should be
01:56:11.400 another object let's say color should be
01:56:14.199 white let's say okay we have this sign
01:56:16.719 out button and when we click to it we
01:56:19.639 actually want to get something from work
01:56:22.880 so I think it should be used o let me
01:56:25.639 double check this can we have like sign
01:56:29.199 out yep we have so here when we click to
01:56:32.440 this so let's say on press I would like
01:56:35.000 to call the sign out function now Ty
01:56:37.840 typescript is not really happy with us
01:56:40.000 it wants you to put it like this so
01:56:42.239 let's go ahead and do it okay let's save
01:56:45.960 if I clict to this we are signed out and
01:56:48.800 our layout runs once again initial
01:56:51.440 layout and it checks that you are not
01:56:54.079 authenticated it takes you to the login
01:56:56.599 page because we always say whenever the
01:57:00.079 uh is signed in field changes you should
01:57:03.000 run this use effect and that's why we
01:57:05.440 are taken to the oath page okay this is
01:57:09.199 the function that we'll be using later
01:57:11.199 in the video but let's just have it for
01:57:13.079 now in the homepage okay now let's go
01:57:16.840 ahead delete this
01:57:20.199 user now when we try to sign up with
01:57:22.800 clerk we should have the user both here
01:57:25.480 and then in our database let's go into
01:57:27.800 the data we don't have any users but
01:57:30.280 let's make it work I'll try to sign up
01:57:33.840 with my Google
01:57:40.800 account so we just signed up hopefully
01:57:43.800 it should be here as well let's take a
01:57:46.440 look at the dashboard that we got the
01:57:48.920 user okay we have it but for for some
01:57:52.440 reason we didn't get that here let's see
01:57:55.000 why this is the case now this is real
01:57:57.599 world programming we could have some
01:57:59.880 problems and errors but we should be
01:58:02.239 able to debug it pretty quickly and I
01:58:05.560 will not cut this part I want you to see
01:58:08.199 the debugging process so I just went
01:58:10.239 into my web books I need to check why it
01:58:14.840 failed do we have any console logs first
01:58:18.320 let's take a look at it here we
01:58:20.960 don't um um here it
01:58:24.320 says b request hit an error while
01:58:27.440 pushing must have it oh okay so as you
01:58:30.400 can tell we should have a default export
01:58:32.679 of a router which I forgot to do in HTTP
01:58:36.840 TS file so we should say export default
01:58:39.800 this
01:58:40.760 HTTP so I'll go ahead at the very bottom
01:58:43.440 of my file I'll say export default let's
01:58:46.800 save now we shouldn't really have any
01:58:50.480 errors okay I'll go ahead try to delete
01:58:53.280 this user once again and I'll try to
01:58:55.960 sign up from scratch the reason that I
01:58:58.520 am deleting this because this event is
01:59:01.360 only called when user signs up right
01:59:04.079 let's go ahead sign out I'll try to sign
01:59:07.560 up and once again just know that we
01:59:10.079 don't really have the user in the
01:59:13.760 database I'll try to sign up with this
01:59:18.119 account let's refresh we have user in
01:59:21.560 Clerk and in convex as well and it is
01:59:24.599 working in real time I I didn't need to
01:59:27.239 refresh it okay so we got the bio which
01:59:30.199 is unset but we have clerk ID email
01:59:33.599 these fields everything that we have
01:59:35.840 just put right and by default you get
01:59:38.840 this underscore ID field coming from
01:59:41.199 convex as well as the creation time okay
01:59:44.719 awesome that means our database now is
01:59:47.840 in sync with the clerk right you have
01:59:50.360 just learned something really really
01:59:52.079 important called Web Hooks and this is
01:59:54.040 something that you can use in your other
01:59:56.520 projects you can talk about it in an
01:59:58.400 interview you can just say I have built
02:00:00.920 a project where I use B hooks to make
02:00:03.840 sure my authentication Service is in
02:00:06.520 sync with my database so on and so forth
02:00:09.360 so this is one of those use cases and
02:00:12.320 later in the video we're going to see
02:00:14.199 how we can check for the authentication
02:00:16.360 in our convex functions but let me just
02:00:18.960 quickly try to mention it so here we can
02:00:22.320 go into this under this context object
02:00:25.960 so you can say aate like context. oath
02:00:30.560 here we can see we can get user identity
02:00:33.520 and this will check if user is
02:00:35.159 authenticated or not so here it says a
02:00:37.760 promise that resolves to user identity
02:00:40.679 if the convex client was configured with
02:00:43.320 a valid ID token and this is related to
02:00:46.599 authentication right so it will get the
02:00:48.760 details about the currently
02:00:50.719 authenticated user and we'll be using
02:00:53.119 this later in the video so with that
02:00:55.360 that's going to be it for this section
02:00:56.920 where we have learned about web books
02:00:59.199 and just for your reference I'll go
02:01:01.000 ahead visit this file and here I'll just
02:01:03.360 add a comment what we are doing in this
02:01:06.159 in this file we just need to make sure
02:01:08.159 that the web hook event is coming from
02:01:10.159 clerk if so we will listen for the user
02:01:13.400 created event and we will save the user
02:01:16.400 to the database okay now we are going to
02:01:19.960 move on with the post creation in the
02:01:22.719 create page so instead of starting with
02:01:25.239 the homepage we would like to First
02:01:27.800 create some posts right and then we are
02:01:30.520 going to build the homepage where we can
02:01:32.320 fetch those posts and display them so
02:01:35.480 here what do we need to do so first
02:01:38.040 things first we need to create a convex
02:01:40.360 function that will take the post details
02:01:43.800 and save it to the database once we
02:01:46.079 click to this button and we also need to
02:01:48.800 store the images right and for file uh
02:01:52.960 uploads thankfully we have a section so
02:01:55.920 if you visit the documentation you
02:01:57.840 should be able to see we have image
02:02:00.239 uploads and you can take a look at the
02:02:02.599 documentation how it is done but I'll
02:02:05.280 try to walk you through it with like
02:02:08.199 with our with our approach and react
02:02:10.840 native and Expo this is mostly for web
02:02:14.239 but as you can tell it can be used with
02:02:16.800 react native as well so we're going to
02:02:19.280 go ahead visit vs code and before we try
02:02:22.239 to build anything I would like to
02:02:24.400 provide you some styles that we are
02:02:26.400 going to have in the create page so
02:02:28.840 under the Styles folder create this file
02:02:31.880 called create. styles.
02:02:36.239 TS and I will go ahead copy everything
02:02:39.400 from my source code and paste it uh like
02:02:43.520 this it is around 100 lines of code
02:02:47.159 let's take a look at it once again we
02:02:49.040 got the width some imports such as
02:02:52.000 Dimensions as well as the stylesheet and
02:02:54.719 we build like really really basic stuff
02:02:57.400 that is related to CSS we give pings
02:03:00.520 borders making stuff centered so on and
02:03:04.000 so forth so this is not a CSS Course
02:03:06.440 once again that's why I'll skip this and
02:03:09.360 we can use these Styles now just in case
02:03:12.800 if you want to type this out let me show
02:03:15.079 you the entire
02:03:17.199 file so you can pause the video if you
02:03:19.920 really wanted to and and type this out
02:03:23.840 but this is not something I'll be
02:03:26.360 doing okay then let's create our convex
02:03:29.560 function and then we'll go ahead build
02:03:31.639 the UI first we just need to have it
02:03:34.280 since this is related to posts I will
02:03:36.719 create it in a file called posts. TS now
02:03:41.360 let's try
02:03:42.639 to build our uh build our file I'll just
02:03:46.760 go ahead zoom in let's get the simulator
02:03:50.320 on the right hand side and try to build
02:03:52.760 it so first I'll create a mutation as
02:03:56.079 you can tell because we would like to
02:03:57.920 create a post and whenever you need
02:04:00.480 stuff that is related to Creation like
02:04:03.360 update or delete you would like to
02:04:05.360 create a mutation you can call this
02:04:07.440 anything once again I will create it as
02:04:10.599 create post which is going to be a
02:04:12.639 mutation let's import it open up our
02:04:15.760 object and give our arguments if you
02:04:18.639 want to create a post you just need to
02:04:21.280 add a Caption This Could Be optional so
02:04:24.119 let's say v. string let's import the V
02:04:27.440 and this could be optional so just say
02:04:29.480 v. optional and then we are going to
02:04:32.320 take another field called storage ID and
02:04:36.199 this will be needed when we want to
02:04:37.960 delete a post once we try to delete it
02:04:40.920 you will actually see this this would be
02:04:43.480 important for now we don't really need
02:04:45.440 to understand it but let's go ahead
02:04:47.440 create the Handler function as well just
02:04:50.199 going to be an async function that will
02:04:53.199 take the context so that we can interact
02:04:56.159 with our database and we can get the
02:04:58.960 arguments okay so as I said we would
02:05:02.159 like to upload some files and for this I
02:05:05.559 will provide you a function that is
02:05:07.679 around three lines of code so it is
02:05:09.960 called as generate upload URL it is a
02:05:12.880 mutation so this is exactly coming from
02:05:15.760 the documentation let me show you
02:05:18.280 this okay so this is the exact same
02:05:20.719 function just on top of it I have added
02:05:23.400 a check where we check for the
02:05:25.520 authentication so uh we say context.
02:05:28.800 oath get user identity I have assigned
02:05:31.880 this to a variable called identity if it
02:05:34.159 is undefined or if it is falsy value
02:05:37.360 we'll just say you're unauthorized but
02:05:40.280 else we are going to create an upload
02:05:42.480 URL so that we can upload our image
02:05:45.960 into okay so let's go into the Handler
02:05:49.320 let's check for the authentication here
02:05:51.760 and get the current user so just say
02:05:54.440 const current
02:05:57.960 user and before we do so I think we just
02:06:00.840 need to get the identity so let me try
02:06:03.599 to get this
02:06:05.320 part and we are going to make this code
02:06:07.800 look a lot better later in the video
02:06:09.920 we're going to build a reusable function
02:06:13.000 to check for the authentication but for
02:06:15.239 now i' like to keep it simple and just
02:06:17.480 give you the longer version okay so
02:06:20.239 we'll just get the identity and if it is
02:06:23.119 not defined we're going to throw an
02:06:25.199 error but else we can get a user so say
02:06:28.639 current user and we'll say await dot
02:06:33.360 like
02:06:34.239 context.
02:06:36.119 dbquery
02:06:37.639 the users table with an index so let's
02:06:42.400 just put dot and go below say with
02:06:47.159 index by clerk ID we're going to take
02:06:50.040 the Callback function
02:06:52.040 just like this let me wrap it and we'll
02:06:55.440 say query. equal to the clerk ID field
02:06:59.599 to the identity do subject so this
02:07:04.000 identity. subject will give you the
02:07:06.119 clerk ID
02:07:07.880 and okay this says this has not any
02:07:10.880 effects because we just need to say the
02:07:14.119 get the first
02:07:16.599 value okay and we can add another check
02:07:20.000 if current user is not defined we can
02:07:22.559 say user not found so I hope this is not
02:07:25.800 any confusing at the moment we will make
02:07:27.960 this look a lot better later in the
02:07:29.800 video but for now this is what we can do
02:07:33.159 to get the
02:07:35.000 user let me put it like this okay so so
02:07:39.840 far we have done nothing related to
02:07:41.880 Creation like creating a post now we can
02:07:44.719 go ahead and actually try to do it I'll
02:07:47.320 say create post let's say await context
02:07:52.639 DB and if we want to add something we'll
02:07:55.320 be using the insert method and we'll
02:07:57.719 like to insert it under the post table
02:08:00.400 and we can add our Fields so we're going
02:08:02.679 to put the user ID so that we know who
02:08:05.239 is the owner of the post then we can add
02:08:08.239 the image URL let's go ahead paste this
02:08:11.440 but we don't really have the image URL
02:08:13.280 at the moment how can we get it well
02:08:15.960 we'll basically just
02:08:17.960 say here I'll say const image
02:08:21.960 URL await
02:08:26.520 context do storage and we'll say get URL
02:08:30.639 we're going to put this um ar. Storage
02:08:34.840 storage ID this will give us an image
02:08:37.239 URL we can just say if image URL is not
02:08:40.639 existed we can throw an error and then
02:08:43.800 we can say the storage ID which is
02:08:46.639 coming from the arguments we're going to
02:08:48.880 put the caption and each post will will
02:08:51.639 have zero likes and zero comments when
02:08:54.920 they first created so with this now our
02:08:58.239 code is happy with us if we don't add
02:09:00.559 this check I think it'll be unhappy with
02:09:03.199 you because typescript thinks this could
02:09:06.040 be undefined or null that's why we will
02:09:08.960 add this check just to make it happy so
02:09:12.320 once we have created the post we would
02:09:14.520 like to
02:09:16.599 increment the number of posts of the
02:09:21.520 user right so I'll just go ahead put
02:09:24.159 this comment
02:09:26.599 increment okay increment user posted by
02:09:31.400 one so how can we do this we can just
02:09:33.960 say AIT context. DB instead of saying
02:09:38.119 insert since we want to update something
02:09:40.480 we'll use patch and the user that we
02:09:43.480 would like to update will be current
02:09:45.360 user and here is the field we'll just
02:09:48.040 say
02:09:49.719 posts let's say current user. posts plus
02:09:55.800 one okay so this is what we have just
02:09:58.880 done and at the end of this function we
02:10:01.239 can return the post ID which would be
02:10:04.040 coming from here let's say con post ID
02:10:07.760 this is what you get as the response and
02:10:10.719 we can return
02:10:15.000 it okay so this is our function let me
02:10:18.040 just zoom
02:10:19.000 out what we have done so far is just to
02:10:22.199 check for authentication and you know if
02:10:25.280 you don't add this part I think this
02:10:27.520 code will not be happy with you because
02:10:29.639 typescript cannot really know if this
02:10:32.119 user is null oops typescript don't
02:10:35.639 really know if this is null into
02:10:37.400 database or if you actually have it
02:10:40.000 that's why we add these if checks and we
02:10:43.079 generated an image URL and create the
02:10:46.360 post then we just increment the users
02:10:49.480 post count by one so this is the
02:10:52.360 function that we would need we will be
02:10:54.239 using this we we are going to call this
02:10:56.960 from the front end which will be in the
02:10:59.840 create page now let's go into the create
02:11:02.800 page and actually try to build the UI so
02:11:06.360 under the app under the tabs we have
02:11:08.800 this create. TSX file let me just zoom
02:11:12.119 in and Shrink this left hand side so we
02:11:15.480 would like to build this function where
02:11:18.159 we just called the create screen
02:11:21.430 [Music]
02:11:23.840 okay so instead of typing everything out
02:11:26.199 I'll just walk you through it like line
02:11:28.400 by line I promise I will explain every
02:11:30.880 single thing that we have here so
02:11:32.800 instead of having this tutorial be 10
02:11:35.159 hours by doing this we can just have it
02:11:38.520 like we can decrement the size by twice
02:11:42.599 right you can just double down that so
02:11:45.040 we are going to get the user from clerk
02:11:47.480 we're going to get the router because
02:11:50.000 once we create a post we would like to
02:11:52.800 navigate the user to the homepage and
02:11:55.719 then each post could have a caption each
02:11:59.079 like uh each post could have an image
02:12:01.960 when we select the image it will be in
02:12:05.159 this state by default it is not so let's
02:12:08.199 go ahead import the use State as well
02:12:10.599 and I would like to keep a loading state
02:12:13.119 so that I can show a loading spinner and
02:12:16.280 this will be true once we say share okay
02:12:20.400 then we would like to get the current
02:12:22.360 user but more on this in a second we
02:12:25.360 would like to pick an image from our
02:12:28.199 media library So currently we have some
02:12:31.280 photos in this machine right in this
02:12:33.880 simulator and how can we select
02:12:36.960 these so basically we will be using a
02:12:39.880 package for this let's go ahead open up
02:12:42.280 our terminal and kill our XO app I will
02:12:46.360 say MPX Expo install and we'll just say
02:12:51.360 Expo Das
02:12:53.800 image Dash picker so I don't really know
02:12:58.719 if you can see it completely but this is
02:13:00.800 how that would look like and anytime
02:13:03.800 you're like anytime you're installing
02:13:06.320 something from Expo you would be using
02:13:08.679 this part but if you are installing it a
02:13:11.559 regular package you would say npm
02:13:13.800 install and then the package name so
02:13:16.199 just keep this in mind this part is
02:13:17.920 really important if you are getting
02:13:20.079 something from the Expo uh
02:13:23.400 ecosystem so with this in mind let's go
02:13:25.920 ahead run this okay why do I have it
02:13:29.159 twice in the terminal let's run this
02:13:33.639 now by using this package we should be
02:13:36.199 able to select an image from our media
02:13:39.559 library now that we have it let's say
02:13:42.159 npx
02:13:45.239 Expo and I'll press R to reload this
02:13:49.400 application there we go this is what we
02:13:51.639 have at the moment now for this UI I
02:13:54.520 would like to get an if check so I will
02:13:56.960 say if there is no selected image we
02:13:59.840 would like to show this kind of a UI
02:14:02.480 right a container that says tab to
02:14:05.119 select an image so let's go ahead and
02:14:07.679 make this work I will add this if check
02:14:10.400 before the return now I know there's a
02:14:12.960 lot of different things let's go ahead
02:14:14.559 and import everything so we're going to
02:14:16.639 get these styles from create uh file
02:14:19.920 we're going to get touchable opacity ion
02:14:22.800 icons let's get the colors I'll walk you
02:14:25.760 through this code and when we press to
02:14:28.520 this touchable opacity we're going to
02:14:30.800 call a function called pck image for now
02:14:33.480 I'll delete it let's
02:14:35.719 save and go into the create page okay
02:14:38.840 there we go this is what we got so we
02:14:41.079 have a view with container style and we
02:14:44.159 have the header section where we have an
02:14:46.599 arrow back icon and then we have this
02:14:49.480 text that says new post post and then
02:14:52.960 like we are just adding this so that
02:14:54.960 this is centered if you delete it this
02:14:57.520 is how that look so this is some dummy
02:15:00.040 view then we have the entire touchable
02:15:02.960 opacity so it doesn't really matter if
02:15:05.159 you press here or if you press here it
02:15:08.520 will always be pressed and then we would
02:15:11.400 like to call a function called pick
02:15:14.719 image so how can we make this work I'll
02:15:17.719 basically provide you this
02:15:21.199 above and once again I'll walk you
02:15:23.119 through it so we're going to get this
02:15:25.079 image picker from the package that we
02:15:27.639 have just installed so I'll go above
02:15:30.119 I'll say import everything as image
02:15:32.880 picker from this package this is
02:15:35.000 something that we have just installed
02:15:37.199 and when we press here we're going to be
02:15:39.360 calling this function which will go
02:15:41.760 ahead launch the image library and the
02:15:45.280 media types that we accept will be
02:15:47.920 images however you can get the live
02:15:50.520 photos as well as the videos I'll go
02:15:53.000 with images in this project you will
02:15:55.480 allow for the editing and aspect ratio
02:15:58.360 will be one to one you can change this
02:16:01.239 and quality we will just decrement it a
02:16:04.040 bit to compress our images and if it is
02:16:07.679 not cancelled we will set our state with
02:16:09.920 it so let's save and here I'll actually
02:16:13.400 console log the selected image say
02:16:16.719 select that image and open up the
02:16:18.800 terminal let's go ahead
02:16:21.520 uh press here there we go our media
02:16:23.599 library is selected if I say cancel
02:16:26.679 nothing will happen but if we try to
02:16:29.239 select an image let's say choose now we
02:16:32.478 can see this is the file that is
02:16:34.599 selected
02:16:35.840 right and we'll be using this uh exact
02:16:39.240 URL to be able to save this to our
02:16:42.599 convex file
02:16:44.478 storage okay so now that we know how to
02:16:47.240 make the create page work since we have
02:16:50.160 a selected image this if doesn't really
02:16:52.840 run instead we see this UI here it says
02:16:56.519 create this is exactly what we have now
02:16:58.879 let's go ahead and build this UI which
02:17:01.359 is going to look like
02:17:03.760 this um so when we like when we select
02:17:07.359 the image we're going to see this UI
02:17:09.280 where we see this header component and
02:17:11.558 then we will preview the image where we
02:17:14.160 can also change it if we really wanted
02:17:16.318 to then we'll have this write a caption
02:17:19.359 section but there's a problem with this
02:17:22.080 and to be able to solve it we have a
02:17:24.080 component but first i' would like to
02:17:26.240 show you the video what is the problem
02:17:29.638 so this is like let me show you when we
02:17:32.200 try to write a comment here we can see
02:17:35.080 the keyboard overflows the input right
02:17:37.959 we cannot really see it like I'll press
02:17:41.280 here there we go we cannot see it we
02:17:43.478 have the same kind of problem here and
02:17:45.879 to be able to fix it thankfully we have
02:17:48.398 a component instead of VI where we're
02:17:50.959 going to have keyboard avoiding view
02:17:54.040 coming from react native so open this up
02:17:57.160 and close it then we are going to add
02:17:59.478 some props to make it work properly and
02:18:03.200 in like we can check for the platform
02:18:06.120 let's go ahead import the platform we
02:18:08.318 will say Behavior will change depending
02:18:10.439 on if user is on iOS or Android on iOS
02:18:15.000 it will work with the Ping and uh in
02:18:18.000 Android it'll work with the height then
02:18:20.160 we can give some Styles just like this
02:18:23.040 which is the container and the vertical
02:18:26.359 offset and again it'll just change
02:18:28.760 depending on the platform now if you ask
02:18:31.080 me how do you know all these values well
02:18:33.558 basically I have just test them out
02:18:35.519 before recording this video and then
02:18:38.359 inside this we're going to have our
02:18:40.519 entire UI so here I'll have a
02:18:43.840 view let's turn this
02:18:46.359 off and it just has this content
02:18:49.519 container as the style let's build the
02:18:52.439 header now I'll put my header that will
02:18:56.200 go here which is going to be a touchable
02:18:59.599 opacity I would like to grab
02:19:03.000 this paste it and we you through it let
02:19:06.760 me put it right
02:19:08.799 here so we have a touchable opacity on
02:19:12.359 press we are going to reset our state
02:19:15.558 and it'll be disabled if we are in the
02:19:18.000 loading State then we have an icon which
02:19:21.120 is close outline and once again it'll be
02:19:25.318 like color will change depending on the
02:19:27.240 state then we have a text so basically
02:19:30.080 we are building this part I hope it
02:19:33.359 makes sense then on press we're going to
02:19:35.760 call this function which is something
02:19:37.478 that we'll build in a second and to have
02:19:40.080 a loading State we are going to be using
02:19:42.599 activity indicator which is coming from
02:19:45.120 react native so let's save there we go
02:19:48.080 this is the UI that we have if you say
02:19:50.800 like go back it will actually take you
02:19:53.840 back if you select an image once again
02:19:56.880 you should be able to see this UI now if
02:19:59.800 it is true we're going to have this
02:20:01.880 activity
02:20:03.000 indicator so I hope this makes sense so
02:20:05.680 far below the header component we're
02:20:08.880 going to build something else which will
02:20:11.240 be a scroll view so let me go ahead get
02:20:14.439 this component close this off and import
02:20:18.359 it from react native and we can add some
02:20:23.560 styling now why this is a scroll view I
02:20:26.600 will show you just in a second once we
02:20:28.920 built this entire UI so let's say it do
02:20:33.560 the bounces will be false keyboard
02:20:35.760 should persist tabs will be handled then
02:20:38.920 we'll like to have a
02:20:40.479 view with some styling and for this view
02:20:43.880 I'll go here let's just say you would
02:20:46.040 like to have a wi component this will
02:20:49.319 take styles
02:20:51.240 let's say Styles or style I should say
02:20:55.120 and this will be El Dynamic if you want
02:20:57.960 to add Dynamic Styles you can use an
02:21:00.399 array just like this we're going to say
02:21:03.200 get the Styles content and if we are in
02:21:06.359 the sharing state if we are in the
02:21:08.520 loading State we are going to add this
02:21:11.120 style as well which will make the UI
02:21:13.920 look like disabled then we would like to
02:21:16.399 add an image section so let me please go
02:21:19.520 ahead and
02:21:21.120 import it or add it there we go we'll
02:21:24.560 get the image from react
02:21:28.120 native okay so instead of getting it
02:21:30.359 from react native I think I'll get it
02:21:32.359 from Expo image so I'll say
02:21:35.280 import uh image
02:21:38.280 component from Expo image so do we have
02:21:42.280 that component or do we have that
02:21:44.200 package I think we should install it so
02:21:46.680 I will open up my terminal once again
02:21:48.600 kill this clear this up I'll say MPX
02:21:51.720 Expo install Expo Das
02:21:55.359 image now why are we using Expo image
02:21:58.399 component is because this package gives
02:22:01.399 you an image component that makes images
02:22:04.560 really optimized so it is like the image
02:22:07.640 component that we have xjs so basically
02:22:10.600 it is for performance reasons so we'll
02:22:13.399 go ahead get the Expo image and we have
02:22:16.520 added this part where we show the
02:22:18.520 selected image these are the SL fing
02:22:20.880 that we have and then we have this
02:22:22.760 change button on press we're going to
02:22:25.200 call the same function once again so
02:22:27.520 let's save open up our terminal and
02:22:30.080 start the
02:22:32.000 application I'll press r or maybe I
02:22:34.600 should press
02:22:39.840 I okay it should restart
02:22:44.040 it let's try to select an image
02:22:51.120 okay here we can see image has been
02:22:53.359 displayed we can change
02:22:56.880 it and it just works as expected and
02:23:00.160 since we have this editing through we
02:23:02.920 can basically edit
02:23:06.160 this okay so below to this image section
02:23:09.880 we'll like to add the input section so I
02:23:12.640 would like to once again get the code
02:23:14.920 and walk you through it so right here
02:23:18.359 I'll put a comment let's say in
02:23:21.080 image
02:23:23.359 section and here we'll have the input
02:23:28.840 section let's paste it we're going to
02:23:31.399 get a text input component the rest is
02:23:35.000 almost the same thing so there is no
02:23:37.800 there is no reason to type this out all
02:23:39.880 again from scratch we are showing the
02:23:42.439 user profile image and we can basically
02:23:45.319 write a caption so here why did we used
02:23:49.200 a component called scroll view it's
02:23:51.800 because like here I think we cannot see
02:23:54.720 it but if we had like
02:23:58.120 multiple lines let me try to add
02:24:01.080 those we can scroll through it in our
02:24:03.520 phone and we can even add like offset I
02:24:07.319 believe needs offset um let's say
02:24:11.240 content offset will be I don't know
02:24:15.920 50 does it have to be string okay so it
02:24:18.960 says Point prop
02:24:21.880 so I don't really know how to use this
02:24:23.640 because I haven't used it to be honest
02:24:26.240 okay we should give X and Y I
02:24:28.960 believe okay X let's say zero will be
02:24:32.200 but y let's say
02:24:35.000 100 so as you can tell we have some
02:24:38.000 offsets and like I just literally
02:24:40.120 learned it with you
02:24:42.319 today and how did I learn it like when
02:24:44.760 you hover over this I just saw this X
02:24:47.200 and Y and when I had 50 so here on the
02:24:51.080 error I I just saw this X and Y and
02:24:54.600 that's why how I realized there is this
02:24:56.640 X and Y Fields so I'll just go ahead and
02:24:59.560 just say y will be
02:25:01.760 100 okay so just because of this scroll
02:25:05.040 view component we are able to make it
02:25:08.160 work like this so let's go here I think
02:25:11.720 I also need to X field I'll make it to
02:25:14.000 be
02:25:15.640 zero we can basically add more stuff and
02:25:19.000 scroll through it here it doesn't really
02:25:21.479 work as expected but in your phone you
02:25:23.680 can imagine with your finger you can
02:25:26.399 basically scroll it and see the entire
02:25:29.040 view okay so this is what we have built
02:25:32.560 for the return statement now when we say
02:25:35.080 share nothing happens right let's just
02:25:37.200 press that literally nothing happens
02:25:39.479 because we don't really have a function
02:25:41.399 for that and let's try to build it now
02:25:43.960 so this is a quick pause that will take
02:25:46.120 around 1 minute I'd like to mention
02:25:48.200 something and I am recording this from
02:25:49.920 theut fure because we have some
02:25:51.640 potential issues so the first things
02:25:53.920 first if you want to see the keyboard
02:25:56.040 when typing this out in the simulator
02:25:58.680 you need to press command shift K and
02:26:01.439 all of a sudden you will see the
02:26:02.920 keyboard but now we still have this
02:26:05.279 problem where keyboard is overflowing
02:26:08.399 with the content so we thought we have
02:26:10.760 fixed the issue by using this component
02:26:13.399 but it didn't really fixed it completely
02:26:16.120 so I found the solution instead of using
02:26:18.240 20 we'll go with 100 and let's save now
02:26:21.800 let's try to see this in action there we
02:26:23.960 go we have 100 pixels of offset and we
02:26:27.479 can see this in action that is working
02:26:30.439 in Android we don't really need to add
02:26:32.640 any uh offset because by default the
02:26:36.439 keyboard will be avoided so you just
02:26:38.840 need to keep this in mind for iOS
02:26:41.200 specifically okay so that was something
02:26:43.200 that I wanted to mention just keep this
02:26:44.960 in mind and let's move on with the video
02:26:47.640 so we need to find this button called
02:26:49.720 share which is going to be under this
02:26:52.800 touchable opacity let's see where that
02:26:55.479 is okay it is this one and we're going
02:26:57.600 to add this onpress handle share
02:27:00.279 function and let's go ahead at the very
02:27:03.560 top try to add this function so first
02:27:06.920 things first we need to get the generate
02:27:10.439 uh upload URL function which is
02:27:12.760 something that we have created here as a
02:27:15.560 mutation and in convex you can just say
02:27:18.760 use mutation if you want to consume it
02:27:21.359 you can say API do whatever the file
02:27:24.640 that is so under the posts we have this
02:27:27.200 mutation and I would like to call this
02:27:29.600 as generate upload URL and in the same
02:27:33.680 way we can get the create post function
02:27:36.560 so I'll just say create post which is a
02:27:39.680 mutation that's why we say mutation
02:27:42.120 later in the video we'll learn things
02:27:43.920 about queries so we'll say use Query but
02:27:46.520 for now it is a mutation and under the
02:27:49.000 posts we will call this as create post
02:27:51.960 this is what we had and then in the
02:27:54.439 handle share function it is something
02:27:57.080 that we need to build let's say const
02:27:59.600 handle
02:28:02.120 share which will be an async function
02:28:05.359 and let me walk you through it now first
02:28:07.520 things first we'll just say if there is
02:28:09.800 no selected image then just return out
02:28:12.240 of this function don't do anything but
02:28:14.840 else we can open up our TR cat TR catch
02:28:18.040 statement and just say we are in the
02:28:20.800 loading state so we just say set is
02:28:23.160 sharing to be true then we are going to
02:28:25.640 get an upload URL by calling this
02:28:28.160 mutation right and then we need to get
02:28:31.040 an upload result by uploading our file
02:28:34.760 and to be able to make this work I will
02:28:36.800 get a package so let's let's uh kill
02:28:40.359 this clear this up I'll say MPX oops let
02:28:45.200 me make it full screen MPX Expo so here
02:28:48.680 is the entire package name I just pause
02:28:50.840 the video and take a look at my notes
02:28:52.760 because I was not able to remember that
02:28:54.960 but there we go it is called as Expo
02:28:57.640 file system let's go ahead and install
02:29:00.359 it by using this package we will be able
02:29:03.600 to upload our images really like
02:29:07.040 performant way and clean let's start our
02:29:12.479 application press R so that it would
02:29:14.840 reload it and here in this function we
02:29:17.760 would like to get an upload result
02:29:20.920 I will go here below paste this and walk
02:29:23.680 you through it we need to get the file
02:29:26.479 system as an import just like what we
02:29:29.600 have done
02:29:31.200 here so we'll say import everything as
02:29:34.520 file system from this package and by
02:29:38.000 using this we can upload upload a URL
02:29:42.000 right or upload an image to this URL
02:29:44.439 that we have what are we going to upload
02:29:46.960 is this selected image our method is
02:29:49.600 post this is the upload type we
02:29:51.880 basically have this binary content and
02:29:54.640 the meme type is image JPEG then we can
02:29:58.200 go ahead just check for the status we'll
02:30:01.600 say if uh if status is not equal to 200
02:30:05.520 which means something failed but else we
02:30:08.080 can get the storage ID from this upload
02:30:11.240 result and then we can call our mutation
02:30:14.880 so it will be a wait create post and
02:30:18.279 we're going to add our fields which we
02:30:20.279 have the storage ID as well as the
02:30:23.560 caption and if everything has done
02:30:26.240 successfully we can take the user and
02:30:29.040 push it to the homepage so let's say
02:30:32.479 slash tabs and in the catch we can
02:30:35.960 basically just say console log error
02:30:39.319 sharing the
02:30:41.319 post you can handle this in a better way
02:30:44.520 but this is how I will leave it and
02:30:46.640 finally we'll say set is sharing will be
02:30:50.080 false either we succeed or we fail in
02:30:53.920 either case the loading State should be
02:30:55.920 false okay let's save and test this out
02:30:59.040 and hopefully you didn't get really
02:31:00.840 confused with this package this is how
02:31:03.680 we can easily upload images easily
02:31:07.160 upload files by using Expo and this is
02:31:10.560 one of those packages that Expo gives
02:31:12.880 you out of the box okay so let's go
02:31:15.600 ahead select an
02:31:18.319 image I'll say choose this one let's say
02:31:21.640 first
02:31:22.900 [Music]
02:31:25.319 post oops let's say first post and share
02:31:29.160 it we have the loading state for a
02:31:31.120 second once it is done successfully we
02:31:34.479 are taken to the hom page let's double
02:31:37.120 check under the posts we should have
02:31:40.479 that and here by the way I don't know
02:31:44.240 why we got the exact same user twice
02:31:46.880 looks like we have a bug that we're
02:31:48.600 going to fix but but here we can see
02:31:50.880 this user has one more one post right
02:31:54.359 under the posts we can see this is the
02:31:56.920 post and we can go into the files we can
02:32:00.560 see this
02:32:02.439 file um if you hover over this I think
02:32:05.680 this is going to give you the
02:32:10.279 preview so I think it was giving me the
02:32:12.920 preview but right now it doesn't but you
02:32:16.000 can take a look at it we have just
02:32:17.800 installed it
02:32:22.359 okay so this is what we have stored in
02:32:24.840 our convex storage so this is how we can
02:32:28.439 create posts let me pretty quickly walk
02:32:31.279 you through it what we have done and how
02:32:33.359 it works from start till the end so
02:32:36.319 first when we visit this page we hit
02:32:38.680 this if check where we say if there is
02:32:40.840 not a selected image then please show
02:32:43.560 this UI and when we click to this we
02:32:47.240 basically call a function called pick
02:32:49.600 image image and it is going to launch
02:32:52.960 our image Library it will allow us to
02:32:55.560 select images and we have some props to
02:32:58.800 add our own customization and if an
02:33:01.680 image selected successfully we're going
02:33:04.040 to set our state with it so I will go
02:33:06.479 ahead and select it now that we have a
02:33:09.160 selected image we are not going to hit
02:33:11.319 this if check but instead we are going
02:33:13.240 to hit this return statement which is
02:33:15.960 going to show us this kind of a UI and
02:33:19.359 when we click to this button we are
02:33:21.359 calling this handle share function and
02:33:24.399 here we are calling two different
02:33:26.479 mutations that we have and we have
02:33:29.120 created these in this file one is to
02:33:32.520 generate an upload URL we just got this
02:33:35.240 from the documentation and added our
02:33:37.840 authentication check and then we have
02:33:40.399 our own create post function where once
02:33:43.640 again we check for the authentication we
02:33:46.439 get an image URL then we create the Post
02:33:50.200 in our database with these fields and
02:33:53.680 then we increment the users post count
02:33:56.880 by one right this is what we have done
02:34:00.000 and let's save this file then here in
02:34:03.200 this function we are basically um
02:34:06.000 consuming those mutations and on top of
02:34:08.800 everything we have used a package called
02:34:11.960 file system this is coming from Expo
02:34:15.040 this allows us to upload images pretty
02:34:17.800 easily and it is really easy to use and
02:34:21.399 if everything has done successfully we
02:34:24.120 take the user to the home screen so I
02:34:27.279 hope everything that we have done in
02:34:28.880 this section makes sense you can pause
02:34:31.359 the video and just analyze the code base
02:34:34.279 for 5 to 10 minutes and once you're
02:34:37.240 ready we can move on with the next
02:34:39.040 section and I have just realized we have
02:34:41.960 an error that is related to users so I
02:34:45.120 don't know why we got this user created
02:34:47.880 twice I think this will never happen
02:34:50.160 again um when we were developing we got
02:34:52.880 this issue but let's go ahead delete all
02:34:55.160 the users and I'll delete all the posts
02:34:58.000 that we have and let's try to sign up
02:35:01.040 all over again just to make sure that
02:35:03.359 this is not happening if it is happening
02:35:05.439 we just we have to debug this so I'll go
02:35:08.880 here into my
02:35:11.240 simulator we need to sign out from it
02:35:13.960 from this account and let's try to sign
02:35:17.000 up
02:35:21.359 so we just signed up let's
02:35:23.720 see we got the user here let's refresh
02:35:27.720 we should have it in the cler dashboard
02:35:29.600 as well there we go I would like to like
02:35:33.479 log out and log in once again and in
02:35:37.359 this case it shouldn't really create
02:35:39.200 this
02:35:42.600 user okay so we didn't really get this
02:35:45.359 and we don't need to refresh it because
02:35:47.319 convex by default is working in real
02:35:49.479 time time and let's try to create a post
02:35:53.240 so I'm just doing this for the debugging
02:35:55.920 purposes just to make sure that the same
02:35:58.800 user is not being created
02:36:03.000 twice okay so we got the post but this
02:36:07.680 uh did not create it once again it just
02:36:10.520 updated the post count so I don't really
02:36:12.760 know why we got the same user previously
02:36:15.479 twice but now it is working um as
02:36:18.600 expected okay so with that that's going
02:36:20.760 of it for this section now let's move on
02:36:23.479 with the home screen which is going to
02:36:25.600 be our feed so we would like to build
02:36:28.399 this header section below to it the
02:36:31.240 stories and then we'll like to fetch the
02:36:33.720 posts that we have in the database so
02:36:36.439 let's go ahead and start with our uh
02:36:38.960 query that we'll built with the convex
02:36:41.640 and then once we built the UI we're
02:36:43.600 going to go ahead and fetch the posts so
02:36:46.640 first I'll go under the convex we have
02:36:48.840 this post file and we would like to
02:36:51.600 build a query let's say export const get
02:36:57.160 feed posts now this is going to be a
02:37:00.600 query because we would like to fetch
02:37:02.600 some data we would be using mutations to
02:37:05.760 update some data or create and delete
02:37:08.479 but uh queries will be used to get some
02:37:11.240 data now in the same way we can add
02:37:13.800 arguments but we don't really need to
02:37:15.800 add we would like to basically fetch all
02:37:18.200 the posts so for for that reason I'll
02:37:20.319 just put a Handler function let's say
02:37:22.880 this is going to be an Asing function
02:37:24.800 where we'll put the context as the first
02:37:28.279 argument once again we can get the
02:37:30.680 arguments but we don't really need it
02:37:32.800 for this function so we'll go ahead and
02:37:35.760 try to build the logic so in the same
02:37:38.720 way so here we have tried to get the
02:37:41.680 current user so what we can do is copy
02:37:44.640 this and paste it here this will check
02:37:48.080 if user is authenticated and it'll get
02:37:50.600 the current user now instead of doing
02:37:52.960 all this again and again we can go ahead
02:37:55.800 take this and make it a reusable
02:37:58.399 function so I will cut this entire thing
02:38:01.560 visit my users file that I have as part
02:38:05.720 of my convex functions and I'll create
02:38:08.880 that helper function so here this is not
02:38:11.920 going to be a mutation or query this is
02:38:14.520 basically an async function that I'd
02:38:17.760 like to call as get
02:38:20.960 authenticated user and let's try to
02:38:24.600 paste this
02:38:25.720 in okay so we just put the entire logic
02:38:29.560 where we return the current user if
02:38:31.960 there is no errors but the only thing
02:38:34.399 that we are missing is the context which
02:38:36.840 we can get as an argument but what is
02:38:39.399 going to be the type of it so it could
02:38:41.520 be either a query context or it could be
02:38:45.279 a mutation context right so let me just
02:38:48.439 grab this
02:38:50.520 mutation context okay and we are
02:38:53.359 importing them from generated server so
02:38:56.279 let's try to save it uh like once again
02:38:59.319 what we are doing here is the exact same
02:39:01.560 thing what we have here so I will delete
02:39:05.840 everything that we have because I will
02:39:08.399 call my function called get
02:39:12.359 authenticated user and I will aade this
02:39:15.800 and I will add my context into it then
02:39:19.160 what this going to give me will be the
02:39:22.600 current
02:39:24.800 user okay so here this is a context
02:39:28.560 going from the mutation and now we will
02:39:31.600 take the exact same
02:39:33.880 thing but this time this context is
02:39:36.600 coming as like from the query that's why
02:39:39.520 we said type could be either query
02:39:41.520 context or mutation context so I hope
02:39:44.399 this makes sense like I'm trying to go
02:39:46.160 really slowly uh just to make sure that
02:39:48.600 we are getting familiar with the convex
02:39:51.840 once we understand this we can just spit
02:39:54.279 up with these functions okay so now that
02:39:57.880 we got the current user we would like to
02:40:00.240 get all posts so just say get all posts
02:40:05.120 and here we can say const posts will be
02:40:09.000 equal to a wait
02:40:11.270 [Music]
02:40:13.000 context.
02:40:14.720 DB we would like to query our posts
02:40:17.920 table and if we don't really have any
02:40:21.439 queries we don't really need to you know
02:40:24.399 just add things like with index so on
02:40:27.359 and so forth we would like to get
02:40:29.200 everything and I would like to order
02:40:31.240 this in the descending order and let's
02:40:34.640 just say collect
02:40:36.319 everything okay so now that we have all
02:40:38.840 the posts let's add let's add a check
02:40:41.479 I'll say if
02:40:42.760 posts. length is equal to zero we'll say
02:40:47.600 return and empty array
02:40:49.800 and then we can finally go ahead just
02:40:51.960 say return posts if you think this is
02:40:54.920 the entire function that we need you are
02:40:57.000 wrong let me tell you why if you hover
02:40:59.479 over the posts you can see we have bunch
02:41:01.960 of different fields and the most
02:41:03.840 important thing is the image URL as well
02:41:06.200 as the caption but there are some stuff
02:41:09.000 that we are missing if you just take a
02:41:11.520 look at this post you don't really
02:41:13.600 understand if we like it already or not
02:41:16.560 and depending on that like we needed
02:41:19.840 because depending on that field we are
02:41:21.680 going to show this as field and if we
02:41:24.640 bookmarked it already we will make this
02:41:26.880 to be filled as well right we'll just
02:41:29.200 have this as a different color so let's
02:41:31.600 go ahead and try to actually build that
02:41:35.040 part so instead of returning the posts
02:41:37.359 immediately I'll say return posts with
02:41:41.800 some info right and let's try to build
02:41:44.560 it I will go ahead just say enhance post
02:41:50.240 with user data and
02:41:56.520 interaction
02:41:58.640 status okay so let's say con posts with
02:42:02.640 info and we would like to do this in a
02:42:07.160 promise.all because we're going to run
02:42:09.080 an array so here I'll just go inside and
02:42:12.080 I will say posts. map we would like to
02:42:15.439 get each single
02:42:17.600 post and I wrap this with an async
02:42:22.200 function just like this let's say async
02:42:25.680 post and call this Arrow
02:42:29.080 function now what do we really want to
02:42:31.200 do we would like to get the post author
02:42:33.880 first because if you take a look at the
02:42:36.200 post you only have the user ID you don't
02:42:39.359 really have the author image or author
02:42:43.279 username right we need to get this data
02:42:46.080 so that we can display it on the UI so
02:42:48.520 we're going to go ah head use this user
02:42:51.240 ID and from that we are going to get the
02:42:54.359 post author so let me just type this out
02:42:56.760 we'll say post author you would like to
02:42:59.760 say await
02:43:01.399 context. DB doget and we're going to say
02:43:06.080 post. user ID so this is going to give
02:43:09.600 us the post author and then we would
02:43:11.920 like to check if we already like the
02:43:14.439 post or not so say await
02:43:17.640 context. DB you would like to query
02:43:21.040 something from the likes array here I'll
02:43:23.920 go ahead and just say with index and if
02:43:26.760 you remember we have an index for this
02:43:29.439 by user and post we're going to get a
02:43:34.200 query and basically I will say if query.
02:43:38.439 equal to here is the user ID which is
02:43:41.920 the current user
02:43:43.840 ID let me give
02:43:47.479 space and then we'll say equal to I
02:43:51.520 think this should be inside and we're
02:43:53.960 going to add basically the other field
02:43:56.200 let's say post
02:43:59.160 ID like this is equal to this post
02:44:05.600 ID okay and out of this thing we would
02:44:09.240 like to get the first result so I'll
02:44:11.439 just say get the first one which is
02:44:13.560 going to give us a like document so
02:44:17.040 let's say const like okay if this is
02:44:20.160 existed that means we already liked it
02:44:23.160 let's save this has been formatted so in
02:44:25.680 the same way I would like to check if we
02:44:27.840 bookmarked a post or not so this is the
02:44:30.880 exact same thing but we are going under
02:44:32.640 the bookmarks table and then we would
02:44:35.520 like to actually return an object So
02:44:39.200 Below to it I'll say
02:44:42.520 return We would like to get every single
02:44:45.600 thing about theost but on top of it we
02:44:48.040 would like to enhance it so we would
02:44:50.160 like to add the author info so I'll just
02:44:52.760 say author object where we will add the
02:44:55.520 author ID post author doore ID then
02:45:00.840 we'll take to add the
02:45:04.160 username which is going to be post
02:45:06.319 author.
02:45:07.960 username uh let's get it and finally
02:45:11.680 we'll like to show the image of the
02:45:14.520 author so post
02:45:17.040 author. image okay then the very last
02:45:21.479 two fields that we need to add if we
02:45:24.000 already elect it or not let's say is El
02:45:27.760 and is
02:45:32.479 bookmarked now like is an object right
02:45:35.920 we would like to convert this into a
02:45:38.560 bullion and we can add two bank
02:45:40.960 operators so this is a basic JavaScript
02:45:43.560 trick that you that you can keep in mind
02:45:46.960 and with this that's going to be for the
02:45:49.399 entire
02:45:50.520 file right let me just make this to be
02:45:54.479 entire
02:45:55.680 screen and zoom out so that you can see
02:45:58.279 the entire function so we got the
02:46:00.439 current user we got all the posts and if
02:46:04.040 it is empty we're going to return an
02:46:05.840 empty array and then we would like to
02:46:08.080 enhance the posts so that we can
02:46:10.960 actually extract the author information
02:46:14.680 as well as if we already like the post
02:46:17.520 and if we already bookmarked it
02:46:20.120 depending on that because we will update
02:46:22.000 the
02:46:23.040 UI and this is how we basically did it
02:46:26.279 we used our indexes that we have created
02:46:29.680 previously and yeah so exactly that's
02:46:33.000 what we have done we are returning the
02:46:34.880 posts with info out of this function and
02:46:38.160 now it is time to go ahead and build the
02:46:41.760 UI then call that query so I will visit
02:46:45.520 the feed let's say this is the file let
02:46:49.640 me make this look like that we will go
02:46:52.720 under the app tabs where we have this
02:46:55.160 index and I'll delete everything that we
02:46:57.600 have here which is the only sign out
02:46:59.760 button we are going to still keep this
02:47:02.399 sign out at the very top we are going to
02:47:05.000 keep this view with this style now on
02:47:07.560 top of it we'll like to add the header
02:47:10.160 section which is going to be this part
02:47:12.680 we have the logo as well as the log out
02:47:15.880 button so let's see how we can make this
02:47:18.479 work I will basically copy and paste it
02:47:21.120 it's around five lines of code and for
02:47:23.600 the Styles we need to add a file let me
02:47:27.120 go ahead and provide this to you so I
02:47:29.479 will just say feed. styles. TS I will
02:47:34.680 grab this from theab repo and if you
02:47:36.920 want to type this out I can show you the
02:47:39.000 entire file this is the longest one that
02:47:41.880 we
02:47:42.960 have so you can pause the video and take
02:47:46.160 a look at
02:47:47.840 it but I think we don't really need
02:47:53.359 it so here you can have the entire
02:47:59.160 file okay I'll just save now let's go
02:48:01.760 ahead import the Styles which are going
02:48:04.080 to be coming from not oath Styles but
02:48:07.720 let's say feed
02:48:10.479 Styles okay then we'll import the icons
02:48:14.560 as well as the colors let's save and
02:48:17.120 take a look at the output okay this is
02:48:19.479 exactly what we got um I'll just open up
02:48:22.720 my terminal and reload
02:48:25.560 this so here you can see uh the text is
02:48:29.279 a little bit different and for this we
02:48:31.600 are using the header title with jet
02:48:34.240 brains mono medium we didn't really
02:48:37.200 install this font if you take a look at
02:48:40.160 the assets let me show this so we don't
02:48:43.359 really have this font installed this is
02:48:45.439 something that we'll do later in the
02:48:47.040 video If in your case you cannot see it
02:48:50.080 highlighted like this just ignore that
02:48:53.240 we are going to install it in a couple
02:48:55.240 of minutes okay so with this now let's
02:48:58.920 keep moving let's keep building after
02:49:01.479 the header we'll like to build the
02:49:03.399 stories section and in our application
02:49:07.240 the story section will not really work
02:49:09.720 but I just want to still implement it
02:49:12.080 with the hardcoded data so that you can
02:49:14.640 see um how to implement that kind of a
02:49:18.439 comp component right so I will go under
02:49:21.720 the components I will create this thing
02:49:24.920 let's say story do TSX and under the
02:49:29.239 constants I will provide you Moog data.
02:49:33.439 TS file so I will go ahead get that
02:49:37.560 file so we have around 50 lines of code
02:49:41.840 for stories and each object has an ID
02:49:45.640 username Avatar which is coming from
02:49:47.880 unsplash and has story bullion so it's
02:49:51.200 either false and true this is couple of
02:49:53.800 different stories that we have around
02:49:56.800 eight of them now let's save and for the
02:49:59.800 story component let's try to build it
02:50:03.720 this is a basic function where we get
02:50:06.279 the styles from feed. Styles we got a
02:50:09.680 couple of different components from
02:50:11.880 react native and then we have the story
02:50:14.439 type which is typescript specific and we
02:50:17.560 just have UI no logic at all just some
02:50:20.239 styles with an image and a text so I'll
02:50:23.279 save this and let's go ahead try to
02:50:25.760 build the remaining part so after this
02:50:28.720 view I would like to add a scroll
02:50:31.359 view let's say scroll view component and
02:50:34.880 I'll explain why are we using this in
02:50:36.760 the first place so I'll just say the
02:50:40.760 shows let me actually copy it so it
02:50:44.080 shows vertical scroll indicator we don't
02:50:46.840 really want to see it so I'll just say
02:50:48.760 false then we would like to add the
02:50:51.040 stories section I will go ahead save
02:50:54.359 this and let's go inside I'll say
02:50:58.279 stories let's paste this in we're going
02:51:00.680 to get the stories from the mock data
02:51:03.120 file and let's get every single story
02:51:06.000 right now let's save there we go this is
02:51:08.960 what we have and here you can see again
02:51:11.760 we just say do not show the scroll
02:51:13.920 indicator if you say true
02:51:19.239 so it did not refresh I'll just say
02:51:24.560 reload okay so I don't know if you can
02:51:27.120 see it but it is not visible
02:51:31.319 actually okay so like normally there
02:51:34.120 should be this scroll indicator at the
02:51:36.720 bottom and here we are trying to hide it
02:51:41.960 now I've used it in my phone when I was
02:51:43.960 testing out it is actually shown but
02:51:46.720 here I don't know why this doesn't show
02:51:48.600 show when it's true but in your physical
02:51:50.960 phone this will actually be visible and
02:51:53.880 I think because the parent has false is
02:51:56.279 it the
02:51:57.840 reason no but this is
02:52:00.760 vertical okay so just keep that in mind
02:52:03.080 if you make it true in the physical
02:52:05.239 phone you'll be able to see a scroll
02:52:07.359 indicator at the bottom and if you make
02:52:10.239 it false it'll not be visible and I will
02:52:12.840 leave it as false specifically so that
02:52:15.960 the bottom scroll bar is never shown in
02:52:19.120 the horizontal Direction This is what
02:52:21.439 modern social media applications does So
02:52:24.359 Below today's stories and Below to this
02:52:27.439 scroll view but still inside the parent
02:52:30.680 I would like to like show my posts so we
02:52:34.120 would like to say posts. map for every
02:52:36.840 single post show a post component but we
02:52:40.120 would like to uh create post component
02:52:43.720 and we also need to fetch the posts
02:52:46.239 fetching posts is easy because we
02:52:48.560 already created our query so I can say
02:52:51.960 const posts will be equal to use Query
02:52:56.319 and we'll say api. posts and get feed
02:53:00.920 posts okay and we can add a loading
02:53:04.040 State as well so I'll just say if posts
02:53:08.279 is equal to undefined and if a query is
02:53:11.960 equal to undefined in convex that means
02:53:14.960 it is in the loading State okay just
02:53:17.080 keep that in mind if it is undefined it
02:53:19.520 will be in the loading State and if it
02:53:21.920 is null that means there is no value so
02:53:25.120 let's say return in this case I would
02:53:27.040 like to return a loader component that
02:53:29.520 we are going to create in a second and
02:53:32.160 let's say if
02:53:35.760 posts. length is equal to zero in this
02:53:39.479 case we would like to return a
02:53:41.560 placeholder I'll just say no posts
02:53:46.200 found and this is a component that we
02:53:48.880 will be using only in this file that's
02:53:51.560 why I'll just scroll at the very bottom
02:53:53.880 and create that component so basically
02:53:56.560 this is a view with a tech with a text
02:53:59.279 that says no posts yet and now we'll
02:54:02.920 take to build the loader component we
02:54:05.359 are going to be using this in multiple
02:54:07.200 places so I will put it into the
02:54:09.880 components folder so just say loader.
02:54:12.680 TSX and let me give you the styling it
02:54:15.960 is a really simple component we have a
02:54:18.479 view where we just show a large activity
02:54:21.840 indicator okay I'll save let's go back
02:54:25.359 try to import this and then we would
02:54:28.200 like
02:54:29.000 to create the post
02:54:31.760 component so for a second I will delete
02:54:34.359 this and I'll just say if this part is
02:54:37.920 true let's see what we're going to see
02:54:40.560 okay this is going to be DUI in the
02:54:42.920 loading State this is what we'll see and
02:54:45.600 let's say if this part is true if we
02:54:48.040 don't they have any posts in the
02:54:49.720 database we're going to see this text
02:54:53.040 and you can always change this and make
02:54:55.040 it a lot better but I'll just leave it
02:54:57.000 as it is now let's add this post
02:54:59.760 component into the UI and we'll like to
02:55:02.720 create a file for this that's going to
02:55:05.080 be under the components so just say
02:55:07.399 post. TSX and let's say
02:55:11.600 rnf where we would like to build a post
02:55:14.680 component and this is going to be taking
02:55:17.080 the post as the the argument or as a
02:55:20.479 prop I should say right so we'll just
02:55:22.720 get the post and here we'll like to make
02:55:25.120 the typescript happy for now I'll just
02:55:27.399 say we're going to get a post it's going
02:55:29.319 to be type of any but in a couple of
02:55:31.239 minutes we will put the actual type and
02:55:33.479 just to not forget it I'll add a to-do
02:55:35.680 so I'll just say add the actual type
02:55:37.520 later in the video and the very first
02:55:39.760 thing I'd like to do is just get the
02:55:41.560 feed sles so I'll go ahead and import it
02:55:44.560 then let's build the UI and we're going
02:55:46.800 to build the functionalities
02:55:48.800 so here under the return statement I'll
02:55:51.000 just delete this text and here I would
02:55:53.200 like to add a style with styles. poost
02:55:57.479 and first let's build the post header
02:56:00.640 I'll just add a comment just in case if
02:56:02.760 you want to copy and pasted from the
02:56:05.000 source code so we're going to have a VI
02:56:08.120 component let's say this will have the
02:56:10.520 style as styles. poost header and this
02:56:15.399 is also types save because it is able to
02:56:18.359 see that file and read the content then
02:56:21.399 inside this view we would like to first
02:56:23.680 put a link so I'll just say
02:56:27.760 link and you might be asking why just
02:56:31.439 imagine when we collect to this section
02:56:35.120 it should take us to the profile of this
02:56:37.120 user right so that's why we're going to
02:56:39.279 go ahead and add a link let's say import
02:56:42.439 the link from Expo router and for the H
02:56:46.520 for now let's just put slash user and
02:56:50.080 slash1 23 later later in the video we
02:56:53.279 actually make it work now this is not
02:56:55.640 really happy with us but let's just say
02:56:58.080 for now we are going to take the user to
02:57:00.080 the I don't know let's say notifications
02:57:02.760 Tab and to make this work it should be
02:57:05.800 looking like this to work properly and
02:57:09.000 then under this link I will have a
02:57:11.600 touchable opacity where we will show the
02:57:14.680 image so let me import this we'll have
02:57:17.800 the image
02:57:18.680 and you can import it from either Expo
02:57:21.120 image or react native in this case we'll
02:57:23.680 use Expo image so that we can actually
02:57:26.200 cach it and make it work performant so
02:57:30.160 we have the source which is post.
02:57:32.399 author. image style content fit
02:57:35.359 transition and then the cache policy and
02:57:38.160 then we're going to show the post author
02:57:40.720 username so let's save this and I will
02:57:43.520 open up my simulator let's go ahead
02:57:46.319 import the post and save hopefully we
02:57:50.120 should be able to see our very first
02:57:52.200 post we don't have the cont content yet
02:57:55.120 but we can see who's the author and then
02:57:58.359 below to this view we would like to put
02:58:02.120 something
02:58:03.239 else I think still inside the view but
02:58:06.160 below to the link so I will say uh show
02:58:09.840 a delete button but we only want to show
02:58:13.560 this if we are the owner of the post so
02:58:16.520 again I will add a Todo let let's say
02:58:18.640 fix it
02:58:21.439 later okay I'll just leave it like this
02:58:24.319 for now let's just say we will have
02:58:26.399 three
02:58:28.239 dots which will be a touchable opacity
02:58:31.600 ion icons ellipses horizontal and we're
02:58:34.720 going to have this white color if we are
02:58:37.720 the owner of the post we will see a
02:58:39.600 delete button and let me show you this
02:58:41.840 as well how it'll look like so we are
02:58:45.399 going to have a touchable opacity with
02:58:48.680 this trash outline so I will delete that
02:58:51.800 and bring this back here we go this is
02:58:53.920 how that look and I can comment out this
02:58:57.640 we will be making this to be dynamic in
02:59:00.239 a couple of minutes and then outside of
02:59:02.920 this view we will like to put the actual
02:59:05.439 image the post image so I will go ahead
02:59:08.880 get the
02:59:10.319 image so it is exact exact same thing
02:59:13.279 that's why I am not typing this out we
02:59:15.520 basically get the post image URL and and
02:59:18.560 we cat this and here we go this is the
02:59:21.279 post that we have shared in the previous
02:59:24.239 section then below to it we would like
02:59:26.760 to put the post actions so here I would
02:59:30.760 like to have my post actions which is
02:59:35.040 going to be the buttons where we can
02:59:37.399 like or we can add a comment we can
02:59:40.479 bookmark so on and so forth so I would
02:59:42.920 like to provide this section which is
02:59:44.800 around 10 lines of code let me save and
02:59:47.279 I'll walk you through it
02:59:48.640 so we have a view this is the parent
02:59:50.920 view where we give the post actions then
02:59:53.479 we have the left hand side which are
02:59:56.080 these two buttons okay so we just show a
02:59:59.120 hard heart outline and then chat bubble
03:00:01.760 outline if I can correctly then we have
03:00:04.279 the bookmark outline that is on the
03:00:06.319 right panel so after this view we would
03:00:09.120 like to like like after this view we
03:00:11.600 would like to put the post
03:00:15.200 info okay so we'll go ahead and just
03:00:18.000 check the number of likes and comments
03:00:20.920 so once again I'd like to just paste it
03:00:23.600 which is around 10 lines of code and I'd
03:00:25.800 like to walk you through it so we can
03:00:27.960 already see some data so here we say be
03:00:31.359 the first one to like this post and
03:00:34.200 we'll just say if there is a caption
03:00:36.279 then display it with the author info
03:00:38.960 then we just say view all two comments
03:00:41.800 later in the video we'll make this to be
03:00:43.960 actual number of comments and then we
03:00:46.200 just say 2 hours ago but now there is an
03:00:49.080 issue if you can see like we just need
03:00:51.760 to scroll even more to be able to see
03:00:54.720 everything so here it is overflowing
03:00:57.080 with the tab bar and to make this work
03:01:00.439 we can scroll to the scroll to the top
03:01:03.200 and actually it'll be in the index. TSX
03:01:06.000 file we'll go into this scroll view
03:01:08.279 where we have this parent scroll view I
03:01:10.880 will add this content container style
03:01:13.880 and from the bottom we'll just give 60
03:01:16.479 padding now if we scroll to the very end
03:01:19.720 we can still have 60 pixels of uh like
03:01:23.680 pading so we can have this area before
03:01:26.399 this just notice how we cannot really
03:01:29.319 see everything clearly right it
03:01:31.279 overflows so this is another thing that
03:01:33.560 you can keep in mind while using scroll
03:01:36.160 view component and now let's go ahead
03:01:38.680 into the post. TSX make these
03:01:41.920 functionalities work where we can like
03:01:44.520 comment and add a bookmark so we are
03:01:48.000 going to start with the like function
03:01:50.120 but before let's just handle this to-do
03:01:52.720 where we would like to add the actual
03:01:54.600 type instead of just saying any so I
03:01:57.120 will delete this line and let's go ahead
03:01:59.439 make this to be let's say post props
03:02:02.040 which is going to be a type that we'll
03:02:03.880 like to create so here we are accepting
03:02:06.640 a post let's go ahead and get that now
03:02:09.439 this post is extended right we just know
03:02:12.319 that from the get feed posts we are
03:02:14.800 returning an object getting all the
03:02:17.479 fields that a post has such as you know
03:02:20.560 everything that you see on the screen
03:02:22.200 and on top of it we have the author uh
03:02:25.040 author author information and then we
03:02:27.840 have two different buan values so we
03:02:30.880 would like to add these so that our post
03:02:33.160 prop is um type save and instead of
03:02:36.560 typing this out since we already know
03:02:38.640 this I will paste this and walk you
03:02:40.479 through it so each post will have an ID
03:02:43.800 which is type of post ID and you can get
03:02:46.840 this ID from a convex generated data
03:02:50.040 model you can also say this is going to
03:02:52.319 be type of string but if you want to be
03:02:54.600 really clear what you are doing with you
03:02:57.319 should say um this should be actual type
03:03:01.239 of post ID right and then on top of
03:03:04.000 these Boolean values we would like to
03:03:06.239 have the author field just like that
03:03:09.239 okay so with this in mind everything
03:03:11.040 should be working as expected now you
03:03:13.359 can just say post and you can see it is
03:03:16.439 type save you can go on under the author
03:03:18.760 and you can get all these fields now I
03:03:21.399 think this is
03:03:22.640 complaining here we go so it says it
03:03:25.760 could be undefined and to be able to fix
03:03:28.200 this I will go here and let me shink the
03:03:31.080 left hand side so when we are getting
03:03:33.120 the post author it says this could be
03:03:35.640 null but we really know that if we have
03:03:38.359 a post we know that we have an author as
03:03:41.399 well so I'll just wrap this with
03:03:43.640 brackets and I'll just add a question
03:03:46.040 mark or exclamation Mark at the end just
03:03:49.080 to say this will never be null we will
03:03:51.800 always have a post author okay let's
03:03:54.479 save now we don't really have any errors
03:03:57.720 okay I hope that makes sense we have
03:03:59.239 just handled our
03:04:01.279 to-do and we can build our like function
03:04:04.920 so I will save this file and since
03:04:07.319 liking a post is related to posts I will
03:04:10.439 go under the convex folder and visit the
03:04:13.640 posts file and we are going to add a
03:04:16.040 function called let's say toggle like I
03:04:20.760 am calling this as toggle like it's
03:04:22.960 because this will both handle liking and
03:04:25.960 unliking so let's say this is going to
03:04:28.080 be tole like which will be a mutation
03:04:30.960 and we would like to get the arcs and
03:04:33.720 here we'll just pass the post ID so that
03:04:36.520 we know which post that we are trying to
03:04:38.960 like so just say it's going to be type
03:04:40.920 of V ID with posts there we go and we'll
03:04:45.040 just say we're going to have a Handler
03:04:46.960 function which will be an async arrow
03:04:49.840 function and we're going to get the
03:04:51.920 context as well as the
03:04:54.000 arcs okay so now let's try to build the
03:04:56.800 function logic so first things first we
03:04:59.319 are going to get the currently
03:05:00.920 authenticated user and since we have
03:05:03.160 this function already we can just call
03:05:05.160 it then we would like to check if we
03:05:07.520 already like this post or not so I'll
03:05:10.239 just say const existing and we're going
03:05:12.760 to go into the likes table and we are
03:05:15.520 going to search for it if we get a
03:05:18.560 result that means we already like this
03:05:21.439 and then we'll like to get the post
03:05:23.520 itself so here we just get the like we
03:05:26.720 just check if we already liked it or not
03:05:29.600 and now it is time to get the actual
03:05:31.479 post so we'll just say context db. getet
03:05:34.800 and pass the post ID let's just add an
03:05:37.720 if check if post does not exist we'll
03:05:40.560 say post not found and now depending on
03:05:43.479 this existing uh existing state we'll
03:05:46.880 just say e either we would like to
03:05:48.800 remove the like or in the else case we
03:05:52.160 would like to add a
03:05:54.600 like okay so if it is existing it means
03:05:57.720 we already liked it where we like to now
03:06:00.399 delete our like so I'll just say a wait
03:06:03.880 context db. delete so basically go ahead
03:06:07.520 delete this like from the likes uh from
03:06:10.800 the likes table and then what we want to
03:06:13.600 do just go ahead decrement the number of
03:06:16.319 likes on this post
03:06:18.279 okay so we just say patch this post and
03:06:20.840 this is the field that we'll like to
03:06:23.080 update so that's going to be it for the
03:06:25.640 if check and I think we can also return
03:06:28.560 false this indicates now the like state
03:06:32.000 is false right so it means it is unliked
03:06:35.800 and then in the else case you would like
03:06:37.800 to basically add a
03:06:40.560 like as you can tell we're going to add
03:06:43.080 a like into the likes table with this
03:06:45.600 user ID and with this specific spefic
03:06:47.920 post and then we'll like to increment
03:06:50.200 the likes count to by one now there is
03:06:52.920 one more thing that we'll like to do if
03:06:55.200 it is not my post I would like to send a
03:06:57.720 notification right so I'll just say if
03:07:00.640 it is not my post let's create a
03:07:02.840 notification and how can we check this
03:07:06.000 let me just provide the code let's save
03:07:08.640 to get this formatting so we basically
03:07:10.920 say if current user ID is not equal to
03:07:14.200 the post user ID right if this is not my
03:07:16.960 post go ahead under the notifications
03:07:19.439 table and create a notification and here
03:07:22.800 are the fields type will be like there
03:07:25.760 we go and
03:07:27.880 finally still inside the lse statement
03:07:31.200 notice how we returned false in the F in
03:07:33.720 the if now here we'll like to return
03:07:36.960 true let's see true this will
03:07:40.399 indicate uh this is now liked okay so
03:07:44.040 that's the entire function believe it or
03:07:45.720 not it looks like too much but actually
03:07:48.720 it is super simple right okay just take
03:07:52.399 a look at this if you really wanted to
03:07:54.479 pause the video then we should be good
03:07:56.680 to go now let's go into this post. TSX
03:07:59.560 file and actually try to call this
03:08:01.760 mutation that we have just created so I
03:08:04.439 would like to have a state first so I'll
03:08:06.680 just say const this is going to check if
03:08:08.960 we already like the post or not so is
03:08:11.680 liked and set is
03:08:14.479 liked this is going to be equal to use
03:08:17.980 [Music]
03:08:20.040 State let me type this correctly there
03:08:23.200 we go and we'll just say post dot is
03:08:25.880 liked and we can now create a function
03:08:29.200 I'll just say const handle like when we
03:08:32.319 click to this icon we would like to call
03:08:35.160 this function so let's say async Arrow
03:08:38.319 function that we're going to build the
03:08:39.760 logic in a second and we can also keep
03:08:42.359 track of the likes count so here I'll
03:08:44.960 just say likes count it will will be a
03:08:47.920 state post. likes that is coming as you
03:08:51.200 can tell from the props there we go now
03:08:54.720 let's visit and find this touchable
03:08:57.640 opacity where we have heart outline icon
03:09:01.120 but we would like to make this to be
03:09:02.720 dynamic so I will cut this for a second
03:09:05.479 I'll say if it is light we would like to
03:09:07.840 show a hard icon but if it is not liked
03:09:12.760 then we would like to show this heart
03:09:14.600 outline let's save I'll just make this
03:09:17.680 to be true so that we can see the fied
03:09:20.200 State there we go and then we would like
03:09:22.520 to change the color as well so I would
03:09:24.920 like to go
03:09:27.399 below and instead of having the white
03:09:29.920 color we'll just say if it is light it
03:09:32.120 should be primary color which is green
03:09:34.760 and otherwise it'll be white then on
03:09:37.800 press let's just save to get this
03:09:40.040 formatting on this touchable opacity on
03:09:43.239 press should call the handle like
03:09:46.319 function so let's go ahead and try to
03:09:48.840 build
03:09:49.920 it so first things first I will just say
03:09:53.160 give me a try catch block and then I'll
03:09:56.239 say AIT toggle like and this is the
03:10:00.600 mutation that we would like to consume
03:10:03.080 so let's say use
03:10:05.040 mutation under the API under the posts
03:10:08.560 there we go get the toggle like let's
03:10:11.120 say con toggle like now we can call this
03:10:15.640 and as you can tell this is is expecting
03:10:18.239 some props wait toggle like it should be
03:10:22.600 okay we are just going to send the post
03:10:24.479 ID let's say post ID will be equal to
03:10:27.200 post doore ID then after this we would
03:10:31.279 like to update the state right I'll just
03:10:33.600 say set is liked and now is this going
03:10:37.560 to be true or is this going to be false
03:10:39.960 I don't really know right we should get
03:10:41.840 a response from this function and this
03:10:44.239 is actually what we have done in the if
03:10:47.520 and lse statements we just return the
03:10:50.560 current state either true or false so
03:10:53.520 here I'll just say const and assign it
03:10:55.800 to a variable called new is liked and
03:10:59.399 we'll just set is liked with it then we
03:11:02.239 can go ahead update the likes count just
03:11:05.720 like this in the catch you can handle it
03:11:08.680 properly or in a different way I'll just
03:11:11.080 save it as a console log so let's save
03:11:14.279 and hopefully this should work out and
03:11:16.439 also I would like to use this likes
03:11:19.000 count in the actual UI so I will go
03:11:23.040 ahead and find the post info section
03:11:26.319 here instead of having this text I will
03:11:28.640 cut it for a second and I will say if
03:11:31.200 leg count is greater than zero then we
03:11:33.640 would like to see the actual actual
03:11:36.120 count otherwise we'll just see the
03:11:38.160 previous text now let's save and I would
03:11:41.040 like to reload this application by
03:11:43.680 pressing R in the terminal okay so I'll
03:11:46.600 go ahead like this there we go we have
03:11:49.080 one like and let's double check
03:11:53.080 this here we can see our post got a like
03:11:56.760 and if we visit the likes uh table we
03:11:59.920 can see we just got a document we can go
03:12:03.200 ahead and try to unlock it this should
03:12:05.800 be
03:12:06.520 deleted in real time here we go and this
03:12:09.760 post now has zero likes so that means
03:12:13.319 everything is working properly and since
03:12:16.160 we just like our own post we shouldn't
03:12:19.160 really have any notifications here we go
03:12:22.359 and now let's test out the notification
03:12:24.560 feature as well I will go ahead and like
03:12:28.319 log out because I will try to sign up
03:12:31.479 with a different account so currently we
03:12:33.880 just have only one user in the database
03:12:36.840 which is this one let's sign up with
03:12:39.160 this and I will like the other accounts
03:12:42.960 post all right so looks like we got an
03:12:45.479 error uh for some reason let's try to
03:12:48.319 reload our application is this something
03:12:50.960 that we just got in development or okay
03:12:53.720 so we are going to see if that error
03:12:56.040 occurs anytime soon um otherwise we can
03:12:59.560 just move on at the moment we can take a
03:13:02.239 look at the notifications we don't
03:13:04.160 really have any documents so I am logged
03:13:07.479 in as a different account and I will try
03:13:10.120 to like the post of this user which
03:13:12.840 should create a notification so I will
03:13:15.239 like it like in real time we got the
03:13:18.200 notification it is type of like this is
03:13:20.760 the receiver this is the sender and we
03:13:23.279 can see this post now has one like and
03:13:27.000 we got that user in the database as well
03:13:30.040 okay so it seems like everything is
03:13:31.560 working now if we try to unlike it
03:13:34.359 obviously we don't really want to delete
03:13:36.120 the notification so I will unlike it and
03:13:39.439 this is not being deleted which is what
03:13:41.720 we would like to have and now you might
03:13:43.680 be asking okay so if this is not my post
03:13:46.560 why on Earth do I see this delete button
03:13:49.439 so this is just an icon this is how we
03:13:51.720 coded it it is hardcoded we're going to
03:13:54.359 fix it obviously but just know that
03:13:57.160 currently if you click to it nothing
03:13:58.960 happens so this is a to-do that we left
03:14:01.399 for the incoming sections and next we
03:14:04.080 can add the common
03:14:06.200 functionality so before we start writing
03:14:08.760 the common functionality I'd like to
03:14:11.359 take a quick break and just talk about
03:14:14.120 the performance issues that we currently
03:14:16.640 have and then I'll give you some
03:14:18.520 resources that you should keep in mind
03:14:20.600 while working with react native so first
03:14:23.399 things first let's see the problems that
03:14:25.359 we have and how we can optimize them so
03:14:27.960 it's going to be under the home screen
03:14:30.120 which is what we have and it's under the
03:14:32.120 app tabs index. TSX file all right so it
03:14:36.800 is going to be related to posts so for
03:14:40.239 now let's go ahead and just cut this
03:14:42.800 we're going to ignore this for a second
03:14:44.680 and we're going to fix that as well I'll
03:14:46.760 just put it right here and comment this
03:14:49.040 out so as if it does not exist and we're
03:14:52.279 going to add it as I said just in a
03:14:54.479 second so what is the problem here that
03:14:56.880 we have now in a real word social media
03:14:59.760 application probably you will have
03:15:02.080 hundreds and thousands of posts and what
03:15:05.479 scroll view does here at the moment when
03:15:08.040 you map through it it actually tries to
03:15:10.880 render all of them at once and this is a
03:15:14.000 problem because your application might
03:15:16.239 crash uh because there is not enough
03:15:18.399 memory so what we should use instead a
03:15:21.319 called a component called flatlist so
03:15:25.720 this is something that I have mentioned
03:15:27.319 if you remember at the beginning of the
03:15:29.399 tutorial and this is the time to use it
03:15:32.520 so what this does is to actually only
03:15:35.560 render what is visible on the screen so
03:15:38.640 just imagine we have 100 posts but
03:15:41.760 currently we can only see one right we
03:15:43.800 cannot see the others so it will only
03:15:47.000 render the one that you see and as you
03:15:49.199 scroll it will render the remaining part
03:15:51.920 so currently we just have only one post
03:15:54.080 but imagine if in the database we had
03:15:56.439 100 posts that would be the case so
03:15:59.760 scroll view tries to render everything
03:16:02.120 at once and flatlist instead does only
03:16:06.000 render what you see on the screen so
03:16:08.359 I'll just bring this back uh maybe the
03:16:11.199 story
03:16:13.040 section and we are going to try to fix
03:16:16.080 it so so let's save so we are going to
03:16:18.720 optimize the post section but now for
03:16:21.399 stories if you think in your social
03:16:24.040 media application you will have let's
03:16:26.239 say at most 20 stories in that case
03:16:29.399 using scroll view is I think completely
03:16:32.120 fine because like if you render every
03:16:35.319 story that you have at once your
03:16:37.880 application will not crash right but you
03:16:40.279 could still use flat list for this case
03:16:42.600 as well so what's like once again what
03:16:45.520 scroll view does is is to render
03:16:47.680 everything that you have at once even
03:16:50.160 though if they are not visible on the
03:16:51.840 screen but on the other on the other
03:16:54.920 hand what flatlist does only render you
03:16:58.560 what what is visible on the screen and
03:17:01.080 as you you know as you see the other
03:17:03.479 elements it goes ahead and render them
03:17:06.319 and it this doesn't really cause any
03:17:08.160 delay or anything but it just improves
03:17:11.479 the performance so before we try to
03:17:14.000 implement it I'd like to give this as a
03:17:16.040 note I'll go into the rout and I'll
03:17:19.680 create a nodes. MD file so that you can
03:17:22.960 have this as a reference at the end of
03:17:24.880 this tutorial let me just copy it and
03:17:27.600 paste it from my notes shrink the left
03:17:30.199 hand side paste this in so these are the
03:17:33.000 notes that I have prepared with the help
03:17:35.000 of AI just to make it look really clean
03:17:37.560 and crisp but I just double checked
03:17:40.439 everything that you see on the screen is
03:17:42.160 completely correct so let's just go over
03:17:44.760 it you should use FL flat list when
03:17:48.239 performance is critical because flatlist
03:17:51.040 only renders items currently visible on
03:17:53.640 the screen and it saves memory and
03:17:55.800 improve your performance and when you
03:17:58.439 have long lists of data so basically
03:18:01.840 what we have in the posts uh post
03:18:04.680 section right when we are rendering
03:18:06.960 potentially large sets of data so this
03:18:09.840 could be your feeds search results
03:18:12.399 message lists so on and so forth now we
03:18:15.160 can read the rest but basically you
03:18:17.279 would like to use scroll view when all
03:18:20.040 content fits in memory so when you are
03:18:22.279 displaying a small fixed amount of
03:18:24.520 content and so on and so forth I hope
03:18:28.000 this helps and we're going to add more
03:18:30.279 notes as we go through this
03:18:33.080 section all right so now that we know
03:18:35.359 the theory but how the hell do we
03:18:38.199 Implement that right so we're going to
03:18:40.120 go ahead what I'd like to do just ignore
03:18:42.960 the stories completely for now once
03:18:45.880 again I'll just cut that that and put it
03:18:48.600 right here as a comment so that it
03:18:50.920 doesn't really bother us so for now
03:18:53.920 let's just think about depost since we
03:18:56.439 are not going to be using scroll view we
03:18:58.399 can basically go ahead and delete this
03:19:01.160 completely and instead use a component
03:19:04.199 called Flat list so let's say flat list
03:19:07.319 imported from react native and this is
03:19:09.560 going to be a self-closed component and
03:19:12.560 let's see how we can use it so instead
03:19:15.680 of doing like
03:19:17.239 posts. map or stories. map we will say
03:19:21.239 this is the data that you would like to
03:19:23.279 map through and for each post what do we
03:19:26.720 want to do we would like to render an
03:19:29.000 item so this is going to be taking a
03:19:32.080 callback where we will take the item so
03:19:35.160 here you can see if you uh press control
03:19:38.560 space you can see index item and
03:19:40.680 separators we would like to get the item
03:19:43.600 and for every single item we would like
03:19:46.040 to return a post component and here
03:19:49.000 we'll go ahead and add the
03:19:51.279 post like this because this post
03:19:54.120 component wants you to add a post prop
03:19:57.399 but now we didn't really add the key
03:19:59.720 right for this there is a special prop
03:20:02.239 called key extractor and we would like
03:20:05.040 to add a unique field such as the ID and
03:20:08.520 then we would like to add this previous
03:20:12.399 uh prop that we have called show I think
03:20:15.680 it should be first
03:20:17.399 yes so since this is related to posts we
03:20:20.600 don't really want to show that vertical
03:20:22.960 uh scroll indicator so I'll just say
03:20:25.120 false for this then I also want to add
03:20:28.479 this content container style where we
03:20:31.479 give some pettings from the
03:20:34.160 bottom okay so I would like to just save
03:20:36.800 it and let's see what we're going to get
03:20:39.199 okay there we go what we have let's just
03:20:41.160 double check I'll reload my
03:20:43.920 application so we can just see our posts
03:20:46.920 just like previously but now it is a lot
03:20:49.040 more optimized and performant but now we
03:20:52.239 don't really have these stories right
03:20:54.279 for this we can go ahead and add another
03:20:56.520 prop so I'll just say list header
03:20:59.680 component and for this we would like to
03:21:02.760 return a com return a component called
03:21:05.399 let's just say stories section you can
03:21:08.319 call this anything but this is the name
03:21:10.000 that I'll be going with now let's try to
03:21:12.840 cut this part and delete this comment I
03:21:16.680 will go ahead and create this component
03:21:19.199 so this will be an arrow function where
03:21:21.359 we can immediately return what we have
03:21:24.120 just cut it okay so I think this is
03:21:26.960 going to
03:21:28.239 be like this so we can just still go
03:21:31.720 like this but I want to make it a bit
03:21:33.560 more beginner friendly so we'll just say
03:21:36.279 return this
03:21:38.239 part and let's paste and remove the
03:21:42.319 comments okay so basically we have a
03:21:45.000 functional component where we return a
03:21:47.199 scroll view with stories and we say this
03:21:50.439 is going to be in the horizontal
03:21:51.880 direction do not show the indicator and
03:21:54.800 this is the Styles okay so everything
03:21:57.600 should be working as expected just like
03:21:59.800 previously but now everything is a lot
03:22:02.080 more optimized and performant because we
03:22:04.760 are using flat list if you really wanted
03:22:08.040 to you can still use flat list for this
03:22:10.279 one as well but since we only have eight
03:22:13.000 stories I think this is completely fine
03:22:15.279 to use scroll View so that was the first
03:22:17.720 thing that I wanted to mention now let's
03:22:19.680 go ahead and talk about something else
03:22:22.239 so I think at the beginning of the video
03:22:24.960 I've talked about the pressable
03:22:27.080 component versus touchable opacity and
03:22:30.239 so far we have only used touchable
03:22:32.279 opacity and it has a reason so I would
03:22:35.040 like to just save this file and go into
03:22:37.680 the notes and try to add some notes so
03:22:40.760 that you can have it on your source code
03:22:43.160 as
03:22:43.840 well let me copy everything
03:22:47.000 and I'll just tell you the difference by
03:22:49.640 reading this file so before I read
03:22:52.560 anything just know that pressable is
03:22:55.439 used in more complex situations when you
03:22:58.760 need more complex interactions and
03:23:01.319 touchable opacity used for more simply
03:23:05.120 like for simple fade effects and this is
03:23:08.000 what we have used so far we don't really
03:23:10.120 have any advanced interactions so we
03:23:13.520 mostly we mostly use touchable opacity
03:23:16.880 but you can take a look at the entire
03:23:18.520 thing once again I just double checked
03:23:20.840 everything that you see on the screen is
03:23:22.399 completely correct but basically you
03:23:24.840 would like to use Pressel for complex
03:23:27.520 interaction States and both of them are
03:23:30.040 used for button purposes and pressable
03:23:34.439 is a little bit more newer like in the
03:23:37.479 old code bases you're going to see
03:23:39.359 touchable opacity more and more and it
03:23:42.319 has a simpler API as well so I think and
03:23:46.120 I hope hope this makes sense as well
03:23:48.120 there is one more thing that I'd like to
03:23:49.960 talk about which is the image component
03:23:53.319 that is coming from react native and in
03:23:55.720 this file I think we are
03:23:58.040 using um the one that is coming from
03:24:00.439 react native and there is another image
03:24:02.560 component which is coming from Expo so
03:24:05.160 what are the differences about those I
03:24:08.040 think I have already mentioned that but
03:24:09.920 I'll just give you some
03:24:12.640 notes which explain it a lot better
03:24:17.040 and once again basically you would use
03:24:19.439 Expo image when you need some like a bit
03:24:22.520 more performance and for caching and in
03:24:25.640 our case since we have high quality
03:24:28.160 images this is a social media
03:24:30.040 application we always want to have some
03:24:32.359 caching so that images loads immediately
03:24:36.479 and we are using Expo images most of the
03:24:39.120 time and you should use react native
03:24:41.160 image when you need basic image display
03:24:43.840 with minimal configuration and when you
03:24:46.399 are trying to keep your apps bundle size
03:24:49.120 smaller here are some more uh some edge
03:24:52.600 cases that you can take a look but this
03:24:54.600 is the general idea that you should keep
03:24:56.560 in mind so with all these nodes in mind
03:24:59.680 we would like to talk about something
03:25:01.399 else which is about fonts So currently
03:25:04.880 probably this is not what you see uh
03:25:07.479 since I am running the demo application
03:25:09.399 as well this gets the font size and font
03:25:12.840 family from the cache so in your case
03:25:16.040 let me me just pretty quickly show you
03:25:18.800 if we go here if I delete this so
03:25:22.040 probably you are seeing the font size
03:25:24.479 just like this but in my case this is
03:25:26.760 coming from the cache and let's try to
03:25:29.439 actually install it so when I first
03:25:31.800 started with this application I didn't
03:25:33.760 really have this at all now I would like
03:25:37.359 to go and show you this assets folder
03:25:40.319 where we have some fonts this is the
03:25:42.600 default font coming with Expo
03:25:45.000 installation but we would like to add
03:25:46.960 our own custom font so first I'd like to
03:25:50.239 give you the
03:25:52.399 URL let me copy it it's going to be
03:25:55.120 coming from
03:25:56.560 jetbrains so jetb brains.com
03:26:00.080 LPM
03:26:01.840 monono once you get into this website
03:26:04.760 you can download the font which is going
03:26:06.920 to give you a zip and from there you
03:26:09.560 would like to find a file so I have
03:26:12.479 already installed it I'll just show you
03:26:14.439 which one it is let me try to copy and
03:26:17.520 paste it into the fonts folder okay so
03:26:22.080 it's really simple you'll go ahead and
03:26:23.880 unzip that folder and grab this file
03:26:27.600 which is jetbrains mono- medium. ttf now
03:26:31.920 we just get this but this doesn't mean
03:26:34.439 we installed it into our application we
03:26:36.840 need to load it for this we'll go into
03:26:39.520 our layout so let me go back into the
03:26:43.319 underscore layout which is our root
03:26:45.520 layout and here we would like to load
03:26:48.439 the
03:26:49.399 font and before we load it I would like
03:26:52.080 to talk about a concept or something
03:26:54.920 called splash screen and you might be
03:26:57.520 asking what the hell is that so when you
03:27:00.319 are trying to log into your application
03:27:03.479 right so when you open this up for a
03:27:06.000 split second you see the icon right that
03:27:08.720 could be in Facebook Instagram Twitter
03:27:11.359 in any application you name it for a
03:27:13.880 split second you see this kind of a
03:27:15.760 screen and this is what we call splash
03:27:17.880 screen the loading screen basically so
03:27:20.760 for this I would like to write some code
03:27:24.199 that will handle the splash screen so
03:27:26.359 we're going to say until our phone's
03:27:29.640 loaded just show the splash screen and
03:27:33.640 you know like once our phone's Loaded
03:27:35.680 show the actual application content so I
03:27:38.800 hope I have explained it in a clean way
03:27:41.239 let's try to see how we can make that
03:27:43.000 work so we'll just first say splice
03:27:45.920 screen scen let's import it from Expo
03:27:48.160 router we'll just say prevent Auto Hide
03:27:51.399 async and then we'll like to load our
03:27:54.479 fonts which we can do it with use fonts
03:27:58.080 hook and I think this is going to be
03:28:00.160 coming from Expo let's say
03:28:03.479 import font oops let's say use fonts
03:28:08.080 which is going to be coming from Expo
03:28:10.479 fonts Expo font okay then this is the
03:28:13.880 font uh path that we'll like to look
03:28:16.160 load so first the name is called as jet
03:28:20.479 brains mono-
03:28:25.040 medium and this is the path that we'd
03:28:27.760 like to import it so we'll just say
03:28:29.880 require go under the assets under the
03:28:32.640 fonts and this is the exact same file
03:28:34.960 that we have just installed it which is
03:28:37.239 going to give us a variable so let's say
03:28:39.359 const we're going to destructure this
03:28:42.680 fonts loaded so this is a bullion that
03:28:46.359 we'll like to check let's say if once
03:28:49.479 loaded then you should go ahead and
03:28:52.000 actually say Splash screen. hide async
03:28:56.640 so once our phone's loaded we would like
03:28:58.680 to hide the SPL screen so that we can
03:29:01.520 actually see the actual application
03:29:04.479 content and we don't really want to add
03:29:06.920 it like this but instead I will go ahead
03:29:09.319 and wrap this with a use callback so
03:29:12.080 that it is memorized and cached let's go
03:29:15.120 ahead import the use callback from react
03:29:18.399 this is on layout root View and we're
03:29:21.439 going to pass it into our safe area view
03:29:24.680 component so let's say on layout we'll
03:29:27.600 like to call this function and if you're
03:29:29.760 wondering what does that mean what this
03:29:31.840 does basically it is invoked on Mount
03:29:34.800 and layout changes with Okay so let's go
03:29:37.680 ahead and
03:29:39.120 save now you should be able to see the
03:29:41.960 exact same font that I have if you
03:29:44.160 cannot see go ahead maybe kill your your
03:29:46.239 application or press R it should reload
03:29:50.279 it and we are able to see our font now
03:29:53.800 for a split second I'll just press R
03:29:56.560 like we can see the splash screen right
03:29:59.279 this is the icon oops let's just press
03:30:01.560 once again this is the icon that Expo
03:30:03.840 gives you you can see it from the assets
03:30:06.920 images and it is this Splash icon.png
03:30:10.520 now you can use this completely like
03:30:13.479 definitely but I have prepared something
03:30:15.720 for you if you want to get it I will go
03:30:18.520 ahead delete this one let me just say
03:30:21.800 delete this and I will provide the one
03:30:24.880 that I have prepared so I have just
03:30:27.000 dragged interrupted it is again called
03:30:29.680 Splash Das icon this is the actual icon
03:30:33.279 that I have prepared and if you toggle
03:30:35.960 the status bar visibility you can see
03:30:38.560 this is the recommended size 1024 Square
03:30:42.199 you would like to get this size for the
03:30:44.520 splash icon and and if you ask like how
03:30:47.920 did I make this open it is command shift
03:30:50.960 p and I'll just tackle this so that it
03:30:53.680 doesn't take any space so let's open up
03:30:56.600 the terminal I'll press R hopefully we
03:30:59.680 should be able to see the splash icon
03:31:01.760 but looks like we can't so I will go
03:31:03.760 ahead just say command
03:31:06.239 C kill the application and restart
03:31:12.720 this okay so for some reason this does
03:31:15.640 not work maybe it is in the cache it
03:31:18.319 should be cleared let's see how we can
03:31:20.319 fix this now what I'll be doing is to
03:31:22.800 kill my terminal and clear this up let
03:31:25.720 me shink the left hand side I would like
03:31:27.680 to start my application from scratch but
03:31:30.399 clearing the cache so I'll just say npx
03:31:32.840 Expo start-
03:31:35.279 C hopefully this will clear the cache as
03:31:38.399 you can tell let's say
03:31:41.359 R okay still we cannot get this icon I
03:31:45.080 don't know why
03:31:46.399 previously it has worked for me but at
03:31:49.160 the moment it doesn't maybe I should
03:31:51.479 kill the application restart it
03:31:56.279 again okay so it does not work let's go
03:31:58.920 ahead and try to find another solution
03:32:01.399 so since it is not working as expected
03:32:03.840 let's take a look at the documentation
03:32:06.120 so this is something expected they
03:32:08.239 basically tell us do not use Expo go to
03:32:11.560 test your splash screen you should get a
03:32:14.319 preview build or produ build to test
03:32:17.120 this out otherwise you might get this
03:32:20.040 kind of conflict that we just got so we
03:32:22.600 can assume that it is going to work in
03:32:24.520 the production and then here are some
03:32:26.880 notes about a splash screen icon this is
03:32:30.120 your recommended size this is what I
03:32:32.239 have mentioned a couple of minutes ago
03:32:34.560 and then it should be a PNG file without
03:32:37.680 a transp like with a transparent
03:32:39.920 background and if you want to configure
03:32:42.319 your you know colors images you should
03:32:44.880 visit the app. Json file where you have
03:32:47.720 all kinds of configurations about your
03:32:51.199 application so you can change the
03:32:53.199 Android icon you can change the icon for
03:32:56.439 all devices and then for the splice
03:33:00.160 screen now in our case we would like to
03:33:03.279 actually change these icons as well
03:33:06.399 which is the icon.png as well as
03:33:08.960 adaptive icon.png so you might be asking
03:33:12.319 what are these so this is the main icon
03:33:15.520 for for our application and adaptive
03:33:18.239 icon is also like the same icon but it
03:33:21.520 is used for newer Android devices so
03:33:25.399 older Android devices will use this one
03:33:28.040 and iOS devices would also use this one
03:33:30.760 but newer Android devices are going to
03:33:32.960 be using this adaptive icon so what I
03:33:36.199 have done is to actually prepare these
03:33:38.920 icons as well which is going to be the
03:33:40.840 same thing with this one so I would like
03:33:43.040 to just copy this paste it once again in
03:33:46.319 and I'd like to delete the icon.png and
03:33:49.640 I'll delete this adaptive icon.png as
03:33:52.040 well so I'll just copy this paste this
03:33:54.359 once again let's say this will be
03:33:56.279 icon.png
03:33:58.680 and adaptive icon.png
03:34:02.560 hopefully this should be our new icons
03:34:06.000 now we cannot really see it I
03:34:08.319 believe let me just open up my terminal
03:34:11.479 and rerun
03:34:13.080 this first we should press I okay so I
03:34:16.600 think the supply screen worked
03:34:19.040 for like let me just double check okay
03:34:22.120 our supply screen now started to work
03:34:24.680 and if we take a look at the
03:34:28.399 Expo can we just go back if you press
03:34:31.239 command M no that was not correct thing
03:34:35.040 let me bring this back is it command D
03:34:38.120 okay we can go
03:34:39.840 home can we refresh this okay let's
03:34:43.359 clear this out and restart once again
03:34:46.319 just I am looking to if it is going to
03:34:49.239 work with the newer icon so I'll press
03:34:52.520 command
03:34:54.720 D come
03:34:59.080 on okay why it does not work commen
03:35:02.600 let's go home okay here we can see our
03:35:05.239 icon also changed and it is working as
03:35:07.960 expected let me give you some notes and
03:35:10.319 hopefully we're going to end this
03:35:13.560 section under the notes I'll get the
03:35:17.399 notes about the
03:35:22.479 icons okay so here you have it icon.png
03:35:26.760 versus adaptive icon.png so this is the
03:35:30.800 standard app icon that appears on most
03:35:33.319 devices it is the primary icon for your
03:35:36.399 application and this is the recommended
03:35:38.880 image size it is the same thing for
03:35:41.239 adaptive icon and adaptive icon has been
03:35:44.880 introduced in in Android 8 this is
03:35:47.359 specific to Android devices and if you
03:35:50.120 don't provide these icons your app will
03:35:52.560 still work but it'll use expose default
03:35:55.680 icons for a professional application you
03:35:58.600 definitely want to include these icons
03:36:01.640 with your custom icons right okay there
03:36:05.000 we go the very last note that I'd like
03:36:07.359 to include are some resources so if you
03:36:11.160 want to find hundreds of other third
03:36:13.720 party libraries you can visit react
03:36:16.160 native. directory so let me show you
03:36:18.600 this pretty
03:36:20.120 quickly so here you have bunch of
03:36:22.520 different packages that you can take a
03:36:24.399 look explore so on and so forth and if
03:36:27.600 you want to handle some gestures which
03:36:30.520 are a great way to provide an intuitive
03:36:33.279 user experience in an application so
03:36:36.000 there is a package for this as well you
03:36:38.000 can learn more about these under the
03:36:40.520 documentation and so you can add like
03:36:43.439 different gestures like P
03:36:46.040 tab rotation so on and so forth and
03:36:49.479 there is one more package that I'd like
03:36:51.880 to mention which is react native
03:36:54.359 reanimated where you can create smooth
03:36:57.279 animations so let's go ahead take a look
03:36:59.520 at the documentation this is really
03:37:01.680 really common like commonly used if we
03:37:04.279 just search for npm install react native
03:37:08.359 reanimated like weekly downloads is over
03:37:11.080 1 million which is
03:37:13.000 insane and you would like to definitely
03:37:15.239 keep this in mind while building
03:37:17.359 applications so these are the some
03:37:19.279 resources that I'd like to mention
03:37:21.359 before we end this section so with that
03:37:23.600 I'll see you in the next one now let's
03:37:25.720 go ahead and Implement common
03:37:27.640 functionality currently everything is
03:37:29.680 hardcoded and at the end of the day we
03:37:31.760 would like to have this kind of a model
03:37:34.040 when we click to this comment icon where
03:37:37.239 we can see the previous comments and we
03:37:39.720 can add our own comment right so let's
03:37:42.640 see how we can make that work first
03:37:44.840 things first I would like to add my
03:37:46.840 convex functions so that we can really
03:37:50.319 consume those functions in a couple of
03:37:52.720 minutes you can put it into the posts.
03:37:56.000 TS file but I would like to actually put
03:37:58.399 it into the comments. TS file it doesn't
03:38:01.319 really matter but this is the convention
03:38:04.000 that I'd like to use or not a convention
03:38:06.560 but it's just my preference so let's
03:38:08.800 create a function to add a comment you
03:38:11.800 can pause the video and try to do it by
03:38:13.880 yourself and then watch my solution
03:38:16.840 let's say this is going to be a mutation
03:38:18.960 right we' like to add some data and if
03:38:21.520 you want to add a comment we need to get
03:38:23.960 some arguments let's say the content
03:38:27.080 which is the comment itself which will
03:38:29.040 be type of string let's say v. string
03:38:32.920 and we should import the V from convex
03:38:36.160 values then we would like to get the
03:38:38.160 post ID so that we know on which post
03:38:41.040 that we are adding a comment then we
03:38:44.199 would like to have the Handler
03:38:47.560 function which is going to be taking the
03:38:49.880 context as well as the requests I mean
03:38:52.560 arguments not request let's go ahead
03:38:55.800 open up our function and try to build it
03:38:58.319 so I would like to get the current user
03:39:01.000 with our function let's say await get
03:39:05.000 authenticated user and pass the context
03:39:07.640 as the argument so we would like to get
03:39:10.239 the post let's say aate context. db.
03:39:14.720 getet and we're going to put the post ID
03:39:17.120 which is going to return the post itself
03:39:19.840 let's add an if check we'll just say if
03:39:22.120 post not found let's throw an error and
03:39:25.279 by the way you can also return a convex
03:39:27.479 error I think I haven't mentioned this
03:39:29.640 but this is also available then we'll
03:39:32.199 like to create the comment itself so
03:39:34.560 we'll just say go into the comments
03:39:36.560 table and try to insert a data which is
03:39:39.600 this one this is the comment author this
03:39:42.279 is the post and this is the content then
03:39:45.120 this is going to give us the comment ID
03:39:47.479 how do I know well when you hover over
03:39:49.560 this it will tell you that the return
03:39:52.520 statement it returns you the ID of the
03:39:55.560 new document okay so I'll just assign
03:39:58.399 this to the comment ID we would like to
03:40:00.840 increment the comment count by one so I
03:40:03.840 will go ahead edit with a comment since
03:40:06.399 we are updating we'll be using patch
03:40:08.479 this is the post that we would like to
03:40:10.000 update and this is the field that we
03:40:11.880 would like to update right post.
03:40:13.880 comments plus one then we would like to
03:40:16.760 create a notification if this is not my
03:40:19.399 post so I'll go ahead add my if check
03:40:22.239 I'll say if post. user ID is not equal
03:40:25.239 to my ID I would like to insert a
03:40:28.800 notification which is type of comment
03:40:31.199 and here is the related data and at the
03:40:34.439 end of the day we could return this
03:40:36.720 comment ID from this function so this is
03:40:40.160 the entire mutation that we have the
03:40:42.520 other one that we would like to add into
03:40:44.279 this file is to get comments which is
03:40:47.399 going to be a query so I'll go ahead
03:40:49.880 just say export const get comments which
03:40:52.920 will be a query let's get this query
03:40:56.600 from our Imports and we'll like to get
03:40:59.560 the like pass some arguments so that we
03:41:02.199 know on which post we are going to get
03:41:04.399 the arguments and this will be post ID
03:41:07.800 which is type of uh posts and we'll just
03:41:11.040 say our Handler
03:41:14.239 function let's grab the context oops
03:41:17.560 context and
03:41:19.199 arguments and try to build the logic so
03:41:22.439 we'll say con
03:41:24.920 comments let's say await do
03:41:29.080 context wait why this is not happy okay
03:41:32.080 it should be like this context. dbquery
03:41:37.479 the comments table with an index so I'll
03:41:41.560 just say dot with index and if you
03:41:43.760 remember we have a IND index called by
03:41:46.760 post so we'll just add our call back
03:41:49.319 function let's say query. equal to this
03:41:52.640 is the field and we would like to
03:41:54.640 collect all the
03:41:56.800 posts I mean all the comments there we
03:42:00.040 go this is going to give us all the
03:42:01.279 comments now there is one more thing we
03:42:03.239 would like to do so if you think we
03:42:05.080 should just say return comments let me
03:42:07.680 tell you my friend you are wrong because
03:42:10.239 in the comments we have no info about
03:42:13.040 the user the only thing we have is the
03:42:14.960 US user ID but in the comment section we
03:42:17.840 would like to show the user image as
03:42:21.560 well as the user full name right and we
03:42:24.640 need to just go ahead fetch those info
03:42:28.080 right and let me provide this to you
03:42:30.880 this is something that we have done
03:42:32.239 previously right we just said posts with
03:42:35.359 info now we'll just say comments with
03:42:37.680 info so we got all the comments and
03:42:40.560 we're going to go ahead map through each
03:42:42.760 comment and for each comment we'll like
03:42:44.960 to get the user which is going to have
03:42:47.640 the full name as well as the image field
03:42:50.560 okay this is going to be our query that
03:42:52.640 we'll be using in a couple of minutes
03:42:54.720 now let's go into the post. TSX I would
03:42:57.560 like to create a couple of different
03:42:59.399 states let sharing everything just like
03:43:02.479 likes count I will duplicate this and
03:43:04.720 we're going to have something called
03:43:07.000 comments count and let's say set I think
03:43:11.520 we should say comments count and this
03:43:14.760 will be post. com comments just like
03:43:17.680 that and then I would like to have one
03:43:19.520 more State just to check if the comments
03:43:23.120 model will be visible or not so I'll
03:43:25.359 just say show comments and by default
03:43:27.720 this is going to be false if this is
03:43:29.720 true we would like to show a model I'll
03:43:32.319 just uh like I'll just scroll to the
03:43:34.279 very bottom of the file just before this
03:43:37.600 view I will add a component called
03:43:40.359 comment let's say comments model and
03:43:43.479 this is a component that we're going to
03:43:45.120 create just in a second let's say this
03:43:47.520 will take the post ID let's say post. ID
03:43:51.680 is this going to be visible or not we
03:43:53.560 will depend on this state called show
03:43:55.800 comments and when we close this uh when
03:43:59.319 we close this model this state should be
03:44:01.640 false so here is the function that we
03:44:03.760 pass and finally once the comment has
03:44:06.720 been added we would like to increment
03:44:08.840 the number of comments so here it says
03:44:11.840 set comments count let's see
03:44:16.439 it should be S okay I had a typle now
03:44:19.439 this should be happy with us but we
03:44:21.439 don't really have the component that's
03:44:24.000 why it crashes let's go under the
03:44:27.040 components and create this
03:44:30.159 TSX let's say
03:44:32.319 rnf save
03:44:34.760 it and try to import it in this
03:44:37.960 file okay let's go ahead and try to
03:44:40.680 build this Commons model component so
03:44:43.760 first I'd like to add my props as my
03:44:46.640 type right so I'll just a type comments
03:44:50.000 model just going to be a type so here I
03:44:53.159 would like to just copy and paste all
03:44:55.600 these four values so we're going to have
03:44:57.920 a post ID which is going to be type of
03:45:00.920 post ID right then we'll get divisible
03:45:03.760 on close and on comment added functions
03:45:07.319 then let's go ahead to say this is the
03:45:09.640 object that we like the D structure now
03:45:11.840 this should be type save let's get all
03:45:14.159 of them so this is typescript specific
03:45:17.600 and we would like to have a state to
03:45:19.720 keep track of the comment itself so when
03:45:23.080 we are typing in we would like to have
03:45:25.680 this state so that we can update it and
03:45:27.960 initially it'll be empty as you can tell
03:45:31.000 then let's try to get our query so let's
03:45:34.399 just say const comments we'll just say
03:45:37.279 use Query coming from conx we'll just
03:45:40.600 say
03:45:42.000 api. comments. getet comments and this
03:45:45.800 is taking an argument which is going
03:45:47.960 which is going to be the post ID then
03:45:50.279 we'll like to have our mutation so I
03:45:52.479 basically duplicate this and I'll say
03:45:54.840 add comment this is going to be a use
03:45:58.239 mutation
03:45:59.960 call just like that API comments and
03:46:04.080 let's say add comment this takes the um
03:46:08.560 I think this is not the place that we
03:46:10.359 should add so for the mutations if you
03:46:13.239 remember when we call it we would pass
03:46:15.960 those right so this is the place to
03:46:18.279 actually pass these arguments not
03:46:21.680 here okay with this in mind I'll just
03:46:25.000 have one more function let's say handle
03:46:27.840 at comment let's say this is going to be
03:46:30.600 an async empty function for now we're
03:46:33.279 going to build the logic just in a
03:46:35.000 second now let's try to build the actual
03:46:37.600 UI so when we click to this it should
03:46:40.479 open up the model right but we don't
03:46:43.359 really have a model in the first Place
03:46:45.800 let's go ahead and try to build it and
03:46:48.640 for a model there's a component exactly
03:46:52.000 called as model which is coming from
03:46:54.120 react native and whatever you put inside
03:46:56.920 of the model becomes a model so let's
03:47:00.479 just try to see how this would work we
03:47:02.560 will say this will be visible depending
03:47:05.239 on this visible state right this prop
03:47:07.920 that we are getting and then we'll like
03:47:10.159 to have couple of different things let's
03:47:12.560 say animation type will be slide so
03:47:15.359 it'll just slide from the bottom and
03:47:18.000 let's say this will be transparent let
03:47:20.680 say it will be not false but true then
03:47:23.920 we would like to have on request close
03:47:27.199 we would like to add our on close
03:47:29.680 function right and then let's try to
03:47:32.600 build the actual component so first
03:47:36.040 things first I would like to have my
03:47:37.840 keyboard avoiding view this is something
03:47:40.199 that we have mentioned previously
03:47:42.359 basically when we want to open up the
03:47:45.040 keyboard we want this input still be
03:47:49.479 visible so that's why we are using this
03:47:53.199 component and I will get some props like
03:47:56.600 the behavior as well as the style let's
03:47:59.439 say
03:48:00.520 platform. and styles I think this Styles
03:48:04.319 will be coming from let me just double
03:48:06.680 check it should be from the feed Styles
03:48:09.600 then we would like to have the model
03:48:11.960 header let's save to get this formatting
03:48:14.840 we'll go into the keyboard avoiding view
03:48:17.359 paste this in save this and let's try to
03:48:20.040 import our components so touchable
03:48:22.960 opacity which will have this close icon
03:48:26.680 let's get the colors and then the
03:48:28.960 comments title so basically we have just
03:48:31.720 built this part now let's try to build
03:48:35.000 the remaining
03:48:38.359 part so after this view we will just say
03:48:41.680 if comments are equal to un find which
03:48:45.479 means we are in the loading State here
03:48:47.840 we would like to return something else
03:48:49.720 we would like to return something else
03:48:52.040 and in this case we would like to have a
03:48:53.840 loader component which is going to have
03:48:57.080 this uh activity indicator which is size
03:49:00.040 of large and then here we would like to
03:49:02.560 actually return our comments and as you
03:49:05.880 might guess we would like to use a
03:49:07.880 component like flat list okay so if you
03:49:12.199 remember we have this data field where
03:49:14.920 we'll just say map through the comments
03:49:17.399 and render item so each comment go ahead
03:49:21.080 and create or render a comment component
03:49:26.199 we don't have this but we're going to
03:49:27.720 build it and let's add the
03:49:31.159 item as the comment field so you can
03:49:34.720 call this anything right but it should
03:49:36.560 make sense so that you know what you're
03:49:38.239 sending and this is the item that we got
03:49:41.600 then we'll like to add the key extractor
03:49:44.680 so I'll just put it right here and then
03:49:46.840 I'll just give some
03:49:49.279 Styles into the Container okay now let's
03:49:53.520 try to build the comment component which
03:49:56.439 is something that I'd like to create
03:49:58.479 under my components folder so let's say
03:50:02.199 comment.
03:50:03.840 TSX and this has no logic at all other
03:50:07.439 than styling and UI so I'll just paste
03:50:11.399 it around 30 lines of code and let's
03:50:14.359 take a look at it so this is using date
03:50:16.880 FNS package let's go ahead and install
03:50:19.279 it so let just say mpm install date-
03:50:24.680 FNS so we'll be using this to be able to
03:50:27.840 format our dates and let's say npx
03:50:31.279 XO and rerun our
03:50:34.960 application okay so basically this has a
03:50:38.080 view an image with some Styles this will
03:50:41.399 take the comment author and then we have
03:50:45.800 you know the full name of the author the
03:50:48.120 comment content as well as the comment
03:50:50.560 time and this will go ahead and format
03:50:52.760 the distance so that it will say
03:50:54.680 something like 2 hours ago 1 hours ago
03:50:58.040 so there isn't anything called 1 hours
03:51:00.120 ago it should be 1 hour ago but you get
03:51:02.720 the point okay let's go ahead and try to
03:51:05.520 import the comment component now I don't
03:51:09.359 know why this is not really happy with
03:51:11.199 us and I think it is because I haven't
03:51:14.080 imported it so here we should be getting
03:51:16.520 it from our comment file now let's save
03:51:20.960 okay and let's try to keep building it
03:51:23.359 where we just have only one more view
03:51:25.840 I'll just say view let's add the Styles
03:51:28.760 which is going to be comment input then
03:51:31.960 inside we are going to put a text input
03:51:34.560 so again this is a component I think we
03:51:36.640 are using this for the very first time
03:51:39.239 or I don't know if we have used it
03:51:41.520 previously yeah I think we used it in
03:51:43.560 the caption section right here when we
03:51:46.520 try to add a caption but basically we
03:51:49.080 got a style a placeholder and then the
03:51:51.560 text color of the placeholder value on
03:51:54.359 change and this could be multi-line then
03:51:58.199 like after this we'll just have a post
03:52:00.359 button which is going to be a touchable
03:52:02.960 opacity when we click it we're going to
03:52:05.279 call this method that we just have above
03:52:08.800 and then and then it'll be disabled if
03:52:11.439 we don't really have a new comment
03:52:13.680 content and we just have some additional
03:52:16.640 Styles okay now when we collect it
03:52:19.080 nothing happens because we never call
03:52:21.199 the function when we click to this icon
03:52:24.000 let's find it which one is that it
03:52:26.319 should be under the actions so right
03:52:29.880 here when we click to this chat bubble
03:52:32.199 outline let's say on press it should
03:52:34.720 make this state to be true let's save
03:52:37.359 and fingers crossed hopefully it should
03:52:39.560 work there we go we can see our model
03:52:43.040 right it is it just sided
03:52:45.239 down or like it just animated from the
03:52:49.000 bottom of the
03:52:50.120 screen it works without any issues so
03:52:53.159 let's go ahead and add something okay
03:52:56.239 but if we try to post it nothing will
03:52:58.359 happen once again we don't have the
03:53:00.600 function logic yet so let's try to build
03:53:03.159 it and I'll just try to walk you through
03:53:05.239 it so first things first we'll just say
03:53:07.800 if you don't have a comment content just
03:53:10.560 return out of this but else we'll like
03:53:12.840 to have a try catch
03:53:14.610 [Music]
03:53:15.920 in the try I'll just say call my
03:53:17.880 mutation which is ADD comment and these
03:53:20.920 are the fields that we would like to add
03:53:22.760 or the arguments so the comment content
03:53:25.479 as well as the post ID once this is done
03:53:28.239 we can just say set new comment to be
03:53:31.600 reseted and then we can just call the on
03:53:34.960 comment added function then in the catch
03:53:38.760 let's just put a console log like this
03:53:42.840 let's save and try to to send our very
03:53:45.560 first comment I'll just say hey nice
03:53:49.840 post let's post it okay so there we go
03:53:53.520 we just got that let's open up our
03:53:56.080 database this post has a new comment
03:54:00.000 under the comments we should be able to
03:54:02.120 see the document but we shouldn't get a
03:54:05.439 notification because I just commented on
03:54:08.600 my own post so this is the account that
03:54:11.479 I am currently logged in behind the
03:54:13.800 scenes I just logged out from the other
03:54:15.680 account but this is the account that I
03:54:17.520 am logged in so just keep this in mind
03:54:20.319 this is my actual post and now let's see
03:54:24.159 if I just try to open up my keyboard
03:54:26.439 with command shift
03:54:28.760 K okay so I just wanted to show you that
03:54:32.239 this is actually avoiding the keyboard
03:54:34.880 view right so we are able to see the
03:54:37.960 content it is not overflowing if you
03:54:40.720 were to use a regular view without this
03:54:45.120 behavior let's see what would happen it
03:54:48.040 overflows right you are typing your
03:54:50.159 comment let's just say hey but you are
03:54:52.720 not able to see what you have just
03:54:55.080 written okay so with this in mind let's
03:54:58.640 save and add one more
03:55:01.680 comment okay let's just say post here we
03:55:04.720 go and our date is formatted by the way
03:55:07.439 if you can
03:55:08.479 see um is there anything that we are
03:55:11.279 missing I don't really think so well
03:55:14.439 actually we have so here we just say
03:55:16.800 view all two comments but this is a
03:55:19.279 hardcoded value right we should fix this
03:55:22.680 actually so we need to get the number of
03:55:25.319 comments and here thankfully we have a
03:55:28.239 state where we just say comments count
03:55:31.239 and when we add a new comment we are
03:55:33.359 actually updating it so it will always
03:55:35.760 work properly we can go ahead delete
03:55:38.640 this and make it work um dynamically so
03:55:43.439 let me just Corp this paste it so
03:55:47.000 instead of just two we have added this
03:55:48.840 part let's save let's try to add one
03:55:51.560 more comment say one
03:55:57.680 more okay it's been added here we can
03:56:00.760 see weew all three comments and when we
03:56:03.920 click to this it should also open up the
03:56:06.720 model let's try to add it here I'll just
03:56:09.439 say on this touchable opacity onclick or
03:56:12.520 on press it should open up the
03:56:15.159 model okay and the other thing that we
03:56:18.080 are missing is this 2 hours ago which
03:56:20.760 should be dynamic not hardcoded so let's
03:56:24.279 say format distance to now get this from
03:56:27.239 data Fess and this is the time that we
03:56:30.399 like to format so if you save this is
03:56:32.880 actually one day ago when we post this
03:56:35.399 it was yesterday and just make sure this
03:56:37.920 is coming from date- FNS and then I
03:56:41.520 would like to scroll to the bottom where
03:56:43.800 we show the commment count instead of
03:56:47.359 showing this always what I'd like to do
03:56:49.880 is just wrap it with an if check so
03:56:52.800 because imagine if we don't really have
03:56:54.880 any comments it'll just say VI all zero
03:56:58.960 comments which doesn't make any sense so
03:57:01.399 I'll just go ahead and say if comments
03:57:05.199 count is greater than zero only then
03:57:08.000 show this part let's go ahead and wrap
03:57:10.520 it okay so with this in mind that's
03:57:13.520 going to be it for for the commment
03:57:14.960 functionality everything works as
03:57:16.960 expected we are able to even send the
03:57:19.520 notifications and let's actually make
03:57:21.960 sure that it is also working I'll just
03:57:24.159 log out from this account log in as the
03:57:27.199 other account and I'll just try to add a
03:57:30.239 comment okay like it doesn't click I
03:57:33.159 think I just I just need to press
03:57:35.080 command shift K to get rid of that
03:57:39.399 effect okay now I can click to it let's
03:57:42.439 open up our database take a look at the
03:57:45.640 notifications and add a comment so this
03:57:48.399 is not my post I should be able to get a
03:57:51.600 notification let's say oops what the
03:57:54.319 heck is
03:57:55.479 happening let's say you know A1 12 3 it
03:57:58.760 doesn't really matter let's post it here
03:58:01.120 we go we can see we just got a comment
03:58:03.720 type
03:58:04.720 notification and here is the receiver
03:58:07.040 here is the sender it works without any
03:58:12.520 issues okay so in the next section we're
03:58:14.960 going to add the add bookmark
03:58:17.640 functionality so for the bookmarks let's
03:58:20.319 go ahead and create a file under the
03:58:22.920 convex I'll just say bookmarks dots and
03:58:26.520 we would like to add our mutation as
03:58:28.479 well as the query so let's start with
03:58:30.720 the mutation this is going to be called
03:58:33.600 as a toggle bookmark because with this
03:58:36.399 single mutation we should be able to
03:58:38.880 both bookmark it and unbookmark it so
03:58:41.960 I'll go ahead paste this because this is
03:58:44.199 something that we have done multiple
03:58:45.560 times and I'll just walk you through it
03:58:47.920 let me import
03:58:49.439 everything okay so this is a mutation
03:58:52.080 where we take an object we'll have some
03:58:54.560 arguments so that we know which post
03:58:57.159 that we are trying to bookmark and then
03:58:59.640 we're going to get the currently
03:59:01.159 authenticated user and we would like to
03:59:04.199 just check if this is already bookmarked
03:59:07.000 or not we're going to query it right
03:59:09.920 with an index and then if it is already
03:59:13.159 existed we going to remove the bookmark
03:59:16.359 but else we're going to insert it and
03:59:19.040 here we'll return false or true to
03:59:21.720 indicate the newest state so this is the
03:59:26.040 mutation now let's go ahead and try to
03:59:28.760 get the bookmarks which is going to be a
03:59:31.319 query I'll just paste it and walk you
03:59:33.680 through
03:59:34.600 it okay so we got the currently
03:59:37.439 authenticated user and we get all the
03:59:40.080 bookmarks of this user but if you take a
03:59:42.960 look at it under under the bookmarks we
03:59:45.359 don't really have any information about
03:59:47.640 the post other than post ID and this is
03:59:50.720 not enough because let me show you the
03:59:53.920 image under the bookmarks page we would
03:59:57.680 like to see the post image right and for
04:00:00.680 that reason we're going to do the same
04:00:02.439 trick that we have done previously we're
04:00:04.760 going to get the resources with the
04:00:07.880 information so we'll just say promise.
04:00:10.279 all map thread for each bookmark get the
04:00:13.439 post and return this out of this query I
04:00:17.159 hope that makes sense these are the
04:00:18.920 things that we have done multiple times
04:00:20.960 so I just didn't want to type this out
04:00:23.239 line by line instead I have just
04:00:25.040 explained everything now with this in
04:00:27.319 mind let's go into the post
04:00:30.520 component and create a function called
04:00:33.880 handle bookmark just like above for the
04:00:37.279 like
04:00:38.479 function when we click to this icon
04:00:41.960 we're going to be calling this function
04:00:43.760 and and let's get our mutation we'll
04:00:45.840 just say toggle
04:00:48.159 bookmark use mutation under the
04:00:51.239 bookmarks if you wanted to you can put
04:00:53.560 it under the posts but I'll just go
04:00:55.680 ahead and add it under the
04:00:58.520 bookmarks so now here in this function
04:01:01.640 I'll just call my mutation let's say
04:01:04.399 await toggle bookmark and we're going to
04:01:07.560 put the post ID and this is going to
04:01:10.080 return the newest State and I will call
04:01:12.920 this as new is bookmarked and then we're
04:01:16.199 going to set our state with it which is
04:01:18.520 going to be set is bookmarked but seems
04:01:21.439 like we don't really have it I will
04:01:23.319 duplicate this let's say is
04:01:26.640 bookmarked and set is
04:01:29.560 bookmarked just like that this is going
04:01:31.600 to be post dot is
04:01:34.120 bookmarked okay hopefully we should be
04:01:36.279 able to say set is bookmarked with this
04:01:39.319 but now when do we call this
04:01:41.920 function well when we call C to this
04:01:44.960 icon called bookmark outline so here
04:01:47.840 I'll just say onpress call this function
04:01:50.359 and we we don't really want to see this
04:01:52.399 always we would like to check if it is
04:01:54.680 already bookmarked or not if so we're
04:01:57.359 going to see The Bookmark icon else
04:02:00.040 we're going to see this one okay let's
04:02:02.319 save take a look at the database let's
04:02:05.279 just put them side by side we don't have
04:02:07.880 any bookmarks at the moment if I click
04:02:10.159 to it here we go it has been added the
04:02:13.439 icon has changed and I can like
04:02:17.000 unbookmark it okay looks like everything
04:02:20.159 is working without any issues and next
04:02:22.520 we are going to add post deletion so if
04:02:25.199 we want to delete a post we should visit
04:02:27.439 the convex folder and try to add a
04:02:30.040 mutation and I will add it into this
04:02:32.680 file called posts. TS so I'll just say
04:02:36.359 export const delete post which is going
04:02:38.760 to be a mutation we' like to take some
04:02:41.359 arguments which is going to be the post
04:02:43.600 ID so that we know which post that we
04:02:46.239 are trying to delete and then in the
04:02:48.520 Handler function we would like to delete
04:02:50.800 it so first we're going to get the
04:02:53.000 currently authenticated user and then we
04:02:55.600 would like to check I mean we would like
04:02:57.960 to fetch the post that we are trying to
04:03:00.560 delete if it does not exist then we can
04:03:03.439 throw an error so I'll just save to get
04:03:05.760 this formatting and then before we try
04:03:08.239 to do anything I would like to just
04:03:10.319 verify ownership so I'll just check if
04:03:13.239 the current user is the owner of the
04:03:15.640 post if not we are going to throw an
04:03:18.159 error so I'll just say post. author is
04:03:20.960 not equal to the current user then
04:03:23.920 return and error but else we would like
04:03:26.439 to delete the post but immediately
04:03:29.439 deleting the post so instead of
04:03:31.199 immediately deleting it we would like to
04:03:33.359 do something else and let me tell you
04:03:36.159 what that is so we would like to delete
04:03:38.479 all the associated likes in this post
04:03:42.279 right so there might be 200 100 likes
04:03:44.880 which are documents that we are storing
04:03:47.199 so we would like to go ahead and delete
04:03:48.920 every single one of them then we would
04:03:51.080 like to delete all the comments as well
04:03:53.080 as the bookmarks so I'll just go ahead
04:03:55.920 add these so this is what I have just
04:03:58.720 added as well as he likes then we'll
04:04:01.319 like to do the same thing for the
04:04:04.880 bookmarks okay so this is what I have
04:04:07.199 just pasted this is really like almost
04:04:09.960 the same thing that's why I don't really
04:04:12.359 think that we should be explaining this
04:04:14.800 and once we have done all these we would
04:04:16.920 like to delete the image from our
04:04:19.199 storage so I'll go ahead add this line
04:04:21.920 and then finally we would like to delete
04:04:24.199 the post itself from the table right so
04:04:28.279 we have bunch of different information
04:04:30.040 about this post we would like to delete
04:04:32.239 it and here I'll go ahead paste this
04:04:34.840 line and I think I have mentioned this
04:04:37.279 previously that we need this storage ID
04:04:40.319 field on the post and I said we are
04:04:42.680 going to need it when we want want to
04:04:44.040 delete the post and here is that exact
04:04:46.479 moment here we just say context. storage
04:04:49.560 delete something and here is the thing
04:04:52.760 that you would like to delete then uh
04:04:55.199 we'll just delete the post itself and
04:04:57.479 finally we can decrement the users post
04:05:00.640 count by one which is going to be the
04:05:03.359 current user and here we'll just say
04:05:05.960 math. Max and if you are wondering why
04:05:08.600 this is the case basically this always
04:05:11.159 make sure that the number of posts at
04:05:14.120 minimum could be zero so imagine for
04:05:17.359 some reason this part equals to let's
04:05:20.760 say minus two this is going to get the
04:05:23.359 maximum value out of these which is
04:05:25.600 going to be zero so the posts will
04:05:27.960 always be zero at minimum I hope that
04:05:31.120 makes sense so with this everything
04:05:33.439 should be good to go I'll just add one
04:05:35.359 more comment here called delete the post
04:05:38.880 now this function could be definitely
04:05:41.040 written in a better way this is the the
04:05:43.880 simplest way that we can do and it
04:05:46.319 doesn't really look that bad you can
04:05:48.640 obviously optimize it but here is what
04:05:51.600 we have we are just checking for the
04:05:54.000 ownership deleting all the likes
04:05:56.439 comments and bookmarks that are
04:05:58.439 associated with this post then we are
04:06:00.680 deleting the file from the storage
04:06:02.840 deleting the post from the table and
04:06:05.279 finally updating the users post count
04:06:09.720 now that we have everything ready we can
04:06:11.880 go ahead and actually call this when we
04:06:15.000 click to this button and just before we
04:06:17.479 make this work we are going to need one
04:06:19.359 more query that is related to users so
04:06:22.800 let's just type this out and then I'll
04:06:24.479 explain what this does so let's say
04:06:26.920 export const get user by clerk ID which
04:06:34.159 is going to be a query and our argument
04:06:36.960 as you can tell will be the clerk ID so
04:06:39.560 let's say ARS passes clerk ID which is
04:06:42.640 going to be type of string let's import
04:06:44.920 the query and we'll just say have a
04:06:47.680 Handler function which will take the
04:06:50.800 context as well as the arcs so we are
04:06:53.720 going to pass the clerk ID of a user and
04:06:56.840 it'll give us the user that is stored in
04:07:00.040 the database so let me explain this
04:07:02.399 might sound complicated but it's
04:07:04.080 actually pretty simple so we have two
04:07:07.040 different users right we would like to
04:07:09.960 let's say get this user we are going to
04:07:12.720 pass the clerk ID of that user and it
04:07:15.199 will give us everything about this user
04:07:17.880 such as this complete document and let's
04:07:20.520 try to see how we can make it so I'll
04:07:23.040 just say const user I'll say a wait
04:07:27.119 context. DB do get or query I think
04:07:32.000 because we're going to query the users
04:07:34.239 table and we would like to query this
04:07:36.680 with an index which is called as by
04:07:39.319 clerk ID this is something that we have
04:07:41.760 created in the schema file right this is
04:07:45.319 exactly what we have done and we would
04:07:47.680 like to get the unique value you can
04:07:51.040 also say first let's use unique this
04:07:54.040 time then we're going to return this
04:07:57.680 user okay now you might be asking why do
04:08:01.000 we need this function how can we use
04:08:03.439 this so let's just see we're going to go
04:08:06.439 into the post component and there is a
04:08:09.840 hook that is coming from Expo or clor I
04:08:13.680 should say let's say use
04:08:16.680 user and let's say const now this gives
04:08:20.399 you a user State let's console lock this
04:08:23.680 say user is here and put the user open
04:08:28.279 up the terminal so here we can see this
04:08:30.640 is the user
04:08:32.080 object I know this looks really weird
04:08:35.000 but user is here there is a lot of
04:08:37.479 different fields we would like to get
04:08:40.040 the ID in that user so that we can call
04:08:43.600 our query to get the convex equivalent
04:08:47.319 of it so let's try to see I'll save and
04:08:51.800 then just try to call my query so I'll
04:08:54.680 say use Query and I'll say you would
04:08:58.880 like to get the api. users. getet user
04:09:02.760 by clerk ID and this wants us to pass an
04:09:06.119 argument which will be the clerk ID and
04:09:08.800 this will be user. ID so we don't really
04:09:12.119 need this one now here you can see the
04:09:14.680 user could be null right what we'll like
04:09:17.840 to do we'll just say let's delete this
04:09:20.399 for a second or I
04:09:22.479 think here I'll just say if we have a
04:09:25.319 user then pass this but else just skip
04:09:29.439 this call until we got the user now we
04:09:32.159 don't really have any errors it is
04:09:35.159 working
04:09:36.479 correctly and this is going to be equal
04:09:38.760 to let's say cost you can call this
04:09:40.880 anything I'll call this as convex user
04:09:43.880 or specifically we can just say current
04:09:46.720 user so this and this is the exact same
04:09:50.720 user but this is the user that is stored
04:09:53.600 in Clerk and this is the user that is
04:09:55.560 stored that is stored in database and
04:09:58.560 this has different fields than this one
04:10:00.720 right such as number of followers
04:10:02.920 following so on and so forth clerk
04:10:05.199 doesn't really store those for
04:10:07.560 us I hope this makes sense this is the
04:10:10.359 best way that I can explain then we'll
04:10:13.040 like to use this field and check if we
04:10:16.760 are the author of the post if not we
04:10:20.000 will not be able to delete it but if we
04:10:22.359 are the owner we can delete that so here
04:10:25.520 if you realize we have a to-do where we
04:10:28.560 would like to fix it now all right so
04:10:32.840 let's go ahead delete that and uncomment
04:10:36.119 this this is the three dots icon that
04:10:40.000 look like this but we would like to show
04:10:42.520 one of these at a time so here I'll just
04:10:45.600 add a
04:10:47.040 comment let's say or actually actually
04:10:51.279 I'll get it from my comments if I am the
04:10:54.000 owner of the post show the delete button
04:10:57.319 and I would like to grab this and I'll
04:10:59.760 just walk you through
04:11:02.239 it so we will say current
04:11:05.680 user let's add a question
04:11:09.479 mark all right so we just say if post
04:11:12.680 author is equal to me right if it is me
04:11:16.920 if it is my post then I would like to
04:11:18.880 show this trash outline icon but else I
04:11:22.239 will show this three dots and currently
04:11:25.920 as you can tell it already worked this
04:11:28.159 is the this is a different account now
04:11:30.960 I'll try to log in with this account
04:11:33.279 let's go back or I should log
04:11:38.560 out and I will log in as the post owner
04:11:42.640 we should be able able to see the trash
04:11:44.800 outline there we go it just updated and
04:11:48.040 we should be able to delete that so here
04:11:50.760 I'll just say onclick or on press we're
04:11:54.680 going to call a function called handle
04:11:58.199 delete let's say yeah handle delete I
04:12:00.840 was going to say handle delete post but
04:12:03.399 this should be good to
04:12:05.520 go and let's create our function let's
04:12:08.640 say handle delete and here in this
04:12:11.840 function we're going to call our
04:12:15.199 mutation let's grab that I'll
04:12:19.279 say delete
04:12:21.920 post it is going to be coming from the
04:12:24.479 posts
04:12:27.199 file and we should be able to call it in
04:12:29.840 this async
04:12:31.359 function now we could have TR catch I'll
04:12:34.040 just accept what AI gives me we are
04:12:36.640 going to call our mutation with the
04:12:38.840 argument let's save and I'll just press
04:12:42.199 this it's been deleted here we go and it
04:12:45.840 says no posts yet let's take a look at
04:12:48.479 the
04:12:50.399 database zero posts and this user should
04:12:53.640 have zero posts it's been updated and
04:12:57.880 that means everything is working as
04:13:00.040 expected now we don't really have any
04:13:02.040 posts just to have something on the
04:13:04.760 application let's go ahead and create
04:13:06.720 some I'll just say choose and let's say
04:13:10.479 ABC or I'll just you know just add
04:13:14.800 anything this should be posted let's add
04:13:18.040 one
04:13:18.760 more okay so one challenge for you when
04:13:21.840 we add a post we take the user to the
04:13:24.279 homepage but we don't really clear the
04:13:26.880 state so you can uh do this let's go
04:13:29.800 ahead maybe I can do it as
04:13:32.880 well once we share this before we take
04:13:36.600 it to here we can just say set and let
04:13:39.880 AI to complete
04:13:41.560 it okay I can add these this is how we
04:13:45.520 can make that work now let's just test
04:13:47.520 this out once again I will add an image
04:13:50.239 let's say choose let's say hey this
04:13:55.800 is
04:13:58.119 my weekend
04:14:02.159 trip let's say this was and let's
04:14:08.199 share now if we go back our state should
04:14:11.319 be updated and here we go we can like
04:14:15.080 add a comment
04:14:16.720 bookmarket let's just
04:14:18.760 say
04:14:20.140 [Music]
04:14:24.080 nice okay everything works as expected
04:14:27.680 and next we can move on with the
04:14:29.560 bookmarks page well just one more thing
04:14:32.800 before we move on to the next section I
04:14:35.000 just realized I didn't show you the file
04:14:37.279 storage so what happens if we try to
04:14:39.720 delete a post we didn't really make sure
04:14:42.359 that if it is has been deleted from the
04:14:44.239 storage I'll go ahead and delete this
04:14:46.359 one now it has gone from here as well so
04:14:49.359 you can just make sure that it is
04:14:51.840 working without any issues so now it is
04:14:54.439 actual time to go ahead and build the
04:14:56.600 bookmarks page so to be able to build
04:14:59.520 the bookmarks page first we just need to
04:15:01.960 visit that file and let's try to make
04:15:05.199 this to be capitalized so that we are
04:15:07.399 consistent in our code base and then we
04:15:09.920 need to call a query which is the one
04:15:12.520 that we have already built under the
04:15:14.520 convex folder and this is our query
04:15:18.439 which we call this as get bookmark posts
04:15:21.680 so this is going to give us all the
04:15:23.199 bookmarks of the current user and we
04:15:25.840 would like to take it and consume it in
04:15:28.439 this file so since we learn since we
04:15:31.439 already learned how to use a query I'll
04:15:34.040 just paste this in so we would call the
04:15:36.239 use Query get the API and get the
04:15:39.199 related query and if this is in the
04:15:42.439 undefined
04:15:43.439 state that means we are in the loading
04:15:45.880 state so this is how that work in convex
04:15:49.479 and let's get this loader component that
04:15:51.680 we have built previously and then we can
04:15:54.840 also get a not found state so we'll just
04:15:58.279 say if the length is equal to zero we
04:16:00.800 would like to show this simple component
04:16:03.880 that I'll just provide so this is a
04:16:06.439 simple function here we have some Styles
04:16:09.840 and it just basically says no posts yet
04:16:13.199 or no bookmarks yet now let's save and
04:16:17.520 take a look at it I think we have a
04:16:19.720 bookmark yep that's why we see this
04:16:22.439 return statement if I unbookmark
04:16:25.399 it so I don't know why this did not
04:16:28.000 update it let me just reload our
04:16:31.080 application let's go here all right no
04:16:34.159 bookmarked post yet let's add this now
04:16:38.000 we can see our bookmarks and let's try
04:16:40.760 to build this now well I just want to
04:16:43.760 speed up the process a bit so that's why
04:16:46.359 I'll just
04:16:47.399 delete this
04:16:49.359 completely and give you some you know
04:16:52.560 code so I'll just say wi which we have
04:16:55.840 the style and this is coming from feed.
04:16:58.239 Styles and this is using the container
04:17:01.159 class and then we'll like to have the
04:17:03.239 header at the top so let's paste this
04:17:05.840 save and this is what we're going to see
04:17:08.040 and then below that we would like to
04:17:10.159 render the posts and for this I'll be
04:17:13.080 using a scroll view so I think we'll
04:17:15.800 just have less bookmarks so it could be
04:17:18.439 a good option to use scroll view but if
04:17:21.439 you wanted to you could use flatlist as
04:17:24.040 well so here I'll just get my code from
04:17:28.040 my notes instead of typing this out I
04:17:30.960 can walk you through it so this is a
04:17:33.000 scroll view component with these Styles
04:17:36.520 and for the content we'll just say
04:17:40.159 bookmark Post St map
04:17:44.359 get every single post and you can just
04:17:47.080 say for now let's just say we're going
04:17:49.640 to have a view
04:17:51.920 component and if you try to say you know
04:17:54.479 post uh I don't know like caption you're
04:17:58.159 going to see that this will complain for
04:18:01.399 a second if you don't add this question
04:18:03.560 mark now it it's because it thinks that
04:18:06.840 this could be null and just to get rid
04:18:08.960 of this error you can either add a
04:18:11.199 question mark or maybe a bit better
04:18:14.119 option would be to make this a function
04:18:17.720 and add a if check so here I'll
04:18:20.439 basically say if there is no post just
04:18:24.239 return null but post is not equal to
04:18:27.760 null then we can just return a view with
04:18:30.640 the image let's get this import the
04:18:34.159 image from Expo image because we are
04:18:36.399 trying to cach it and this cach policy
04:18:39.680 has a bunch of different options this is
04:18:41.840 the one that makes in this use case but
04:18:44.840 you can take a look at the other options
04:18:47.520 here we can see we have like four in
04:18:50.840 total okay let's save here we go this is
04:18:53.720 the post that we have let's try to un
04:18:56.840 bookmarket it's been updated let's try
04:18:59.560 to add it once
04:19:00.880 again you know it just works without any
04:19:04.399 issues okay so that's going to bit for
04:19:06.880 this screen as well next we can move on
04:19:10.560 with the notifications
04:19:13.119 which looks like this at the moment all
04:19:15.760 right so to start with notification
04:19:17.720 screen let's go ahead and find the
04:19:20.279 actual file which is going to be this
04:19:22.880 but before we try to build the UI let's
04:19:25.239 try to build the query that is going to
04:19:27.840 give us all the notifications that we
04:19:30.319 have for our account and for this we
04:19:33.199 would like to create a convex function
04:19:36.080 which is going to be a query you can put
04:19:38.239 it in any of these files but I believe
04:19:40.920 it would be better if we go ahead and
04:19:42.720 and create a file called notifications.
04:19:45.640 yes let's shink the left hand side and
04:19:48.199 say export const uh let's say get
04:19:52.600 notifications okay that's going to be a
04:19:54.520 query you can pause the video and try to
04:19:57.319 do it if you really wanted to but uh
04:20:00.560 like let me just go ahead and build it
04:20:02.840 so since we would like to get every
04:20:04.439 single notification for the current user
04:20:07.399 we don't really need to pass any arcs so
04:20:10.000 we'll just say Handler where will just
04:20:11.960 take the context
04:20:13.319 and we would like to build the logic so
04:20:16.199 first things first as always we would
04:20:18.119 like to get the authenticated user and
04:20:21.040 then we'll just get the notifications so
04:20:23.720 let's say const notifications and let's
04:20:26.520 await this call context. db. query where
04:20:30.600 we would like to go under the
04:20:31.920 notifications table and let's try to
04:20:34.479 query it query it with a index so I'll
04:20:38.000 just say with index and for this we'll
04:20:40.279 just say buy receiver and and we'll just
04:20:43.399 say if we are the receiver give us all
04:20:46.199 the notifications and this is how we can
04:20:48.720 do the current user ID if it is matching
04:20:51.680 with the receiver ID you should just go
04:20:54.199 ahead and collect all the notifications
04:20:57.479 and I would like to sort this before so
04:20:59.760 I'll just say order should be in the
04:21:02.199 descending order so we would see the
04:21:04.760 latest one at the top and the oldest one
04:21:07.520 at the bottom here we can see it says 2
04:21:10.119 days ago and this is like 8 hours ago it
04:21:12.800 is sorted in this
04:21:16.119 order okay now if you
04:21:20.159 think we say like return notifications
04:21:23.600 this function is done you would be wrong
04:21:26.479 right because if you think about it once
04:21:29.000 again under the notifications we don't
04:21:31.479 really have any information about the
04:21:33.720 post the only thing we have is the post
04:21:36.159 ID in the same way we don't really have
04:21:38.600 any information about the sender other
04:21:41.239 than their IDs but we would like to get
04:21:44.000 more info about them and let me show you
04:21:46.680 what I mean so this is the notification
04:21:49.119 sender right we'll like to get their
04:21:51.319 profile image as well as their username
04:21:54.439 and in the same way we'll like to get
04:21:56.359 information about the post okay so I
04:21:59.800 hope that makes sense this is something
04:22:01.520 that we have done actually in the past
04:22:03.840 where we where we would just say
04:22:06.159 notifications with info right we have
04:22:09.399 done this in our other queries so in the
04:22:12.359 same same manner I'll go ahead and
04:22:14.199 create
04:22:16.080 this uh variable then we're going to say
04:22:19.359 promise. all and we'll just say
04:22:22.600 notifications. map for each notification
04:22:25.600 we would like to run this call back
04:22:28.080 function right and we'll just say const
04:22:31.199 let's first get the sender of the
04:22:33.479 notification and this is how we can do
04:22:35.479 it this is going to give us the sender
04:22:38.080 and then I'll just say let post will be
04:22:41.359 equal to null
04:22:43.359 and let's duplicate this this will be
04:22:47.800 comment now you might be asking why are
04:22:50.479 we doing this I think we'll just see
04:22:52.359 this in a second let's say if our
04:22:55.239 notification has a post ID that means
04:22:58.720 this is related to a post and we are
04:23:01.439 going to go ahead fetch that post we'll
04:23:03.920 say post will be a wait context db.
04:23:07.319 getet this specific post and let's say
04:23:10.479 if notification is
04:23:13.479 D type is equal to comment and if it has
04:23:17.640 a comment ID we would like to go ahead
04:23:20.080 and get the comment itself so that we
04:23:23.040 can display it right here
04:23:25.800 right okay so I hope that makes sense
04:23:28.720 now if you don't really add this part
04:23:30.640 typescript will be unhappy with you so
04:23:33.760 that's why we are adding it and then
04:23:35.920 after this if check we can go ahead and
04:23:38.359 return an object so I'll just say get
04:23:41.080 everything about the not notification
04:23:43.479 but on top of it we'll like to add the
04:23:46.040 sender information so we'll just say
04:23:49.040 let's give the ID we'll like to give the
04:23:51.920 username as well as the image so here it
04:23:55.319 says sender could be null but we just
04:23:57.840 know that if there is a notification we
04:24:00.840 we will always have a sender right so I
04:24:03.319 can go ahead wrap this with brackets and
04:24:06.720 just say exclamation point this will
04:24:09.880 never be null
04:24:12.720 okay finally we would like to say like
04:24:16.040 return the post as well as the comment
04:24:18.880 for the comment I'll just say get the
04:24:21.560 content okay just like that this should
04:24:23.760 be good to go and at the end of the day
04:24:26.199 we will return the notifications with
04:24:29.600 info okay let me just make this entire
04:24:32.000 screen zoom out so that you can see it
04:24:34.399 clearly so this is our entire query and
04:24:38.159 I hope this makes sense like we cannot
04:24:41.159 just return the notific ations as it is
04:24:44.199 we would like to get it with the info so
04:24:47.040 that we can grab the post comment and
04:24:49.880 the sender
04:24:51.840 information okay I hope that makes sense
04:24:54.119 let's zoom
04:24:55.119 in I will shrink
04:25:00.880 this okay now this is the query that we
04:25:03.800 have just built now let's go into the
04:25:05.880 notifications under the tabs and try to
04:25:09.000 build the UI before we get into it let's
04:25:12.080 say we would like to use a
04:25:15.520 query just like this we would like to go
04:25:18.439 under the notifications file and get our
04:25:21.279 notifications this is the query and
04:25:23.880 while we are in the loading State we can
04:25:26.439 show a loader and once again this is how
04:25:30.479 it works in convex if a query value is
04:25:33.800 equal to undefined that means you're in
04:25:36.359 the loading State and let's say if we
04:25:39.119 don't have any notifications we'll like
04:25:41.439 to return this component which is
04:25:43.640 something that I will provide it's about
04:25:46.399 five lines of code just like this let's
04:25:49.399 get these Styles but this like these
04:25:52.880 styles are going to be coming a okay
04:25:55.680 they're going to be coming from a file
04:25:57.359 that we would like to create so I'll
04:25:59.040 just say
04:26:01.239 notifications.
04:26:02.920 styles. TS and you can grab this from
04:26:06.319 the source code and if you don't have
04:26:08.080 the source code you can just you know
04:26:10.439 take a screenshot
04:26:12.560 and type this out I'll just show you the
04:26:14.720 entire
04:26:21.560 file okay so these are just some styling
04:26:25.640 let's get these
04:26:27.080 Styles get the ion icons as well as the
04:26:31.960 colors okay so currently I think we have
04:26:34.920 some notifications that's why we cannot
04:26:37.560 see this UI let me just press R so that
04:26:40.880 it is been Reloaded
04:26:43.000 and let's go into the notifications page
04:26:45.359 okay so looks like we got some
04:26:47.199 notifications but let's just say if this
04:26:49.520 is the true case this is what we're
04:26:51.760 going to see and please feel free to
04:26:53.840 update this UI this is not looking that
04:26:56.279 good but it's just good enough for a
04:26:59.239 placeholder okay let's save um shink the
04:27:03.840 terminal shink this one I would like to
04:27:06.439 go ahead and just update this return
04:27:08.760 statement so I will have my view let's
04:27:11.479 say Style will be styles. container just
04:27:15.080 like as always then we'll like to have
04:27:17.720 our header component so I'll just say
04:27:20.319 styles that header and here this is our
04:27:22.920 title where we say notifications then we
04:27:25.720 would like to have a flat list you can
04:27:28.279 also use a scroll view component but for
04:27:31.560 in my case I'll be using a flat
04:27:35.359 list okay say flat list imported self
04:27:40.119 closed and the data that we'll like to
04:27:43.199 map through will be notifications for
04:27:46.000 every single item we would like to
04:27:48.080 render this function let's say we're
04:27:51.680 going to get the item we are going to
04:27:54.279 create a component called
04:27:57.159 notification
04:27:59.319 item and we're going to pass the
04:28:02.319 notification as the prop which will be
04:28:05.199 the item then let me just grab the key
04:28:09.399 extractor so this is the key when we use
04:28:12.680 in react in react native it is equal to
04:28:15.920 key extractor I don't want to show the
04:28:19.520 vertical uh scroll indicator so I'll
04:28:22.000 just say false and finally let's give
04:28:24.399 some Styles now if you save obviously it
04:28:27.319 will crash so let's go ahead and create
04:28:29.800 this
04:28:31.530 [Music]
04:28:33.239 component so notification item this is
04:28:36.119 going to
04:28:37.239 take a prop let's say it will be the
04:28:41.479 notification
04:28:42.840 just like what we have here for now
04:28:44.840 let's just say type will be any later in
04:28:46.720 the video we can fix it and let's say we
04:28:49.080 would like to return this statement and
04:28:52.399 this will be only UI specific so I'll
04:28:55.800 just have a
04:28:57.650 [Music]
04:29:01.359 view okay let's go ahead and add some
04:29:05.920 Styles so the first style that we would
04:29:08.239 like to have will be notification item
04:29:10.880 then we are going to have a another
04:29:13.760 component called VI and this time I'll
04:29:16.840 again get the styling just like this so
04:29:19.760 I don't really want to type this out
04:29:21.520 just to save a bit of time there is no
04:29:23.720 logic at all and let me tell you what
04:29:26.199 we're going to do so here I would like
04:29:28.760 to wrap this component with a link so
04:29:32.080 that when we click to it this would take
04:29:34.040 us to the profile of this user
04:29:37.760 and let's try to build it I would like
04:29:40.680 to copy this link I think it is around
04:29:44.000 10 lines of code and I will walk you
04:29:46.199 through it so we have a link that is
04:29:48.520 coming from Expo currently we don't have
04:29:51.239 the user profile so I'll just take them
04:29:53.359 to the notifications later in the video
04:29:56.000 we are going to fix it so I'll just say
04:29:57.880 too fix later and we will have touchable
04:30:02.040 opacity we're going to have an image
04:30:04.279 from Expo image and we're going to pass
04:30:07.560 the source style content fit and then we
04:30:11.080 are going to have this View and like
04:30:13.520 this is the kind of like it looks a
04:30:16.359 little bit complicated but it's
04:30:17.800 basically if and lse statements couple
04:30:20.319 of times so we say if notification type
04:30:23.159 is equal to like then show a hard icon
04:30:26.319 but in the else case check if the
04:30:28.520 notification type is equal to follow if
04:30:31.319 so show this icon but else go ahead and
04:30:34.600 show this one so depending on that we
04:30:36.960 are going to see either this one or this
04:30:41.000 and this one
04:30:43.880 so this is what we have just done let's
04:30:46.279 save go into this page here we go we
04:30:49.520 have two different notifications one is
04:30:52.239 like the other one a
04:30:54.760 comment okay after this view we would
04:30:58.399 like to and actually after this link We
04:31:01.439 would like to add one more view so I'll
04:31:04.399 just say View and turn this
04:31:08.399 off and this is going to be actually
04:31:10.960 notification in info class so I would
04:31:13.880 like to go ahead and get one more link
04:31:17.359 so please feel free to type this out or
04:31:19.880 grab it from the source code if you
04:31:21.560 don't really want to again we are going
04:31:23.800 to fix this for now let's say it'll take
04:31:26.159 us to the notifications because we don't
04:31:28.800 really have the users page so let's say
04:31:31.199 too fix later and let's save this is
04:31:34.040 going to give us the username then after
04:31:37.040 this link We would like to have this
04:31:39.680 text so it'll say either they have
04:31:42.720 commented or they like your post or like
04:31:46.560 started following you and we are going
04:31:48.880 to put these dynamically once again
04:31:52.239 depending on the notification type so I
04:31:55.119 would like to go below this link have a
04:31:58.800 text
04:32:00.840 component just like this and I will give
04:32:03.560 a style called
04:32:05.560 action and then we're going to do this
04:32:08.520 conditional rendering so here I'll just
04:32:11.119 say if not ification type is equal to
04:32:13.119 follow show this one if it is equal to
04:32:15.399 like show this one else show the comment
04:32:18.880 itself let's save and take a look at it
04:32:22.720 so this one has commented as undefined
04:32:25.920 looks like we got something
04:32:28.960 wrong um we're going to fix it okay so
04:32:31.960 this shouldn't really say undefined but
04:32:34.960 seems like the rest is working and after
04:32:38.359 this text I would like to put one more
04:32:40.640 text just to show show like when this
04:32:43.439 has been posted and it will just say get
04:32:46.000 this function from dat FNS and this will
04:32:49.319 take the creation
04:32:51.479 time now it is working it says about 5
04:32:54.600 hours ago or one day ago and after this
04:32:58.479 step I mean after this View and after
04:33:00.880 this view just before the very last one
04:33:04.400 you would like to show the image and we
04:33:07.599 only want to show this if it is related
04:33:10.118 to a post so let just do contrl Z so
04:33:14.160 this notification is related to a post
04:33:16.879 so we just show that in the same way we
04:33:20.080 show the post but this has nothing to do
04:33:22.599 with a post and we don't really show
04:33:25.118 anything so for that reason we need to
04:33:27.438 do conditional check so I will just say
04:33:31.240 after this view if
04:33:33.400 notification has a post ID or if it is
04:33:37.958 like if notification. post is true then
04:33:41.359 we will like to go ahead render this
04:33:43.958 part and let me grab this which is an
04:33:46.919 image
04:33:49.278 component okay so notification. post
04:33:52.320 image URL will will be the source
04:33:55.480 otherwise we are not going to show
04:33:57.599 anything but seem seems like this
04:34:00.278 crashed let's go ahead and rerun
04:34:08.840 this okay so for some reason we cannot
04:34:12.118 get the image let me console log this
04:34:16.561 what is wrong with this say
04:34:19.080 console.log the
04:34:26.759 notification okay so we got the
04:34:28.719 notification we have ID field creation
04:34:32.000 time okay so post is null for some
04:34:36.561 reason so why is this the case maybe it
04:34:40.240 is because we have posted something and
04:34:43.278 we have deleted that but when we delete
04:34:45.879 the post we didn't delete the
04:34:48.080 notifications so I think this is what
04:34:50.520 happened let me just double check if we
04:34:53.199 go into the posts
04:34:56.080 file when we try to delete a post we
04:35:00.719 have deleted the likes comments
04:35:04.199 bookmarks but we forgot to delete the
04:35:07.080 notifications right okay so I have just
04:35:09.879 realized this I can leave this as a
04:35:12.000 to-do for you let's say to-do delete
04:35:14.958 Associated notifications and you can
04:35:17.639 pause the video try to do it and then
04:35:20.278 watch my solution all right so I have
04:35:22.719 just paused the video and implemented
04:35:25.080 let me show you my solution so first I
04:35:27.480 have visited the schema. TS file and
04:35:30.599 added an index called by post and just
04:35:33.958 make sure you added this index to the
04:35:36.639 notifications table so once you have
04:35:38.879 added this part we going to come back to
04:35:41.438 here here and we will just fetch all the
04:35:44.000 notifications by this post just like
04:35:46.799 what we have done above right then we're
04:35:49.278 going to just do a for Loop to delete
04:35:52.199 every single notification and now then
04:35:55.118 now that this is not a to do we can
04:35:56.759 delete this and we can just move on with
04:35:59.359 the video but since these are the
04:36:01.919 previous notifications we cannot delete
04:36:04.118 them this will work from the next like
04:36:07.359 future post deletions but we can
04:36:10.840 manually can go into the database and
04:36:14.240 try to just delete all the
04:36:17.359 notifications okay let's say delete all
04:36:19.639 of them and we are going to test
04:36:22.561 everything from scratch so here I would
04:36:25.359 like to just create one more post let's
04:36:31.680 say some nice
04:36:34.630 [Music]
04:36:39.438 pick okay so from this account we have
04:36:42.480 two different posts let's go ahead log
04:36:45.400 out and log in with the other account
04:36:48.840 then we will try to create some
04:36:51.480 notifications so we are just doing this
04:36:53.719 for the testing purposes to see if
04:36:56.160 everything is working okay so I'm just
04:36:58.599 logged in with a different account I
04:37:00.520 will like this post and I will add a
04:37:03.759 comment let's
04:37:05.080 say dude this is
04:37:08.700 [Music]
04:37:10.320 sick okay okay we have added this let's
04:37:13.958 like this one as well and add one more
04:37:17.799 comment let's say hoay like
04:37:23.320 this now let's try to go back to the
04:37:26.080 other
04:37:26.958 account now let me just try to log
04:37:33.879 out and we're going to check the
04:37:38.480 notifications so here we go we got one
04:37:41.520 un like from this user on this post we
04:37:44.160 got a comment it says dude this is sick
04:37:47.438 the same thing for this comment so it
04:37:49.599 seems like everything is working we
04:37:52.118 cannot really see the follow
04:37:54.438 notification at the moment because we
04:37:56.520 don't really have that functionality
04:37:59.080 implemented but once we done this we are
04:38:02.799 going to test this out again okay so for
04:38:05.799 this section just keep that in mind we
04:38:07.958 have added this index to the
04:38:09.799 notifications table we went ahead and
04:38:12.799 added this part so that if we delete a
04:38:15.799 post all the notifications that are
04:38:18.199 related to that post will be
04:38:20.958 deleted and then we have basically
04:38:23.520 implemented this entire
04:38:25.799 file now what I'd like to do instead of
04:38:28.958 putting this into this file I will just
04:38:32.520 actually cut
04:38:34.199 it and put it under my components and
04:38:38.039 instead of calling this as notification
04:38:40.039 item I'll just say
04:38:42.639 notification. TSX let's say just paste
04:38:46.561 this
04:38:47.561 in and we need to get all the Imports so
04:38:51.520 here's what I generally do instead of
04:38:53.599 importing them one by one I just go
04:38:55.799 ahead import everything and then I press
04:38:58.160 command shift p and I and I say organize
04:39:01.118 Imports so what that does it just gets
04:39:04.039 rid of all the Imports that we are not
04:39:06.199 using so there we go this is just a cool
04:39:10.240 trick that you can keep in mind and
04:39:12.400 let's just say export default this
04:39:16.340 [Music]
04:39:17.958 function all right let's save go back
04:39:21.199 and try to import this and I would like
04:39:23.520 to call this as notification instead of
04:39:25.879 notification
04:39:27.160 [Music]
04:39:28.599 item save this file go back
04:39:31.879 and get this one okay now this file
04:39:35.080 looks a lot more cleaner if you really
04:39:37.320 want to you can take this and put it
04:39:39.200 into its own component and its own file
04:39:42.680 but I think this is like five lines of
04:39:44.958 code I think that's completely fine and
04:39:47.120 once again I'll just say command shift p
04:39:49.360 organize the
04:39:50.440 Imports here we go I don't know why we
04:39:53.680 get an error for a split second but
04:39:56.600 seems like everything is working as
04:39:58.638 expected now at this point if you really
04:40:01.160 want to add the notification type you
04:40:03.480 can pause the video and try to do it
04:40:05.920 that would be a great challenge because
04:40:07.760 we have done this multiple times and you
04:40:09.840 can just test out your for knowledge if
04:40:12.440 you cannot do it feel free to ask it in
04:40:14.600 the comments and we can answer that so I
04:40:17.000 will delete this console log let's save
04:40:19.760 it and just before we end the section I
04:40:22.718 would like
04:40:23.680 to fix something else and why are we
04:40:26.718 getting this here it says require not no
04:40:31.000 module okay so actually this is existed
04:40:34.878 but you may also want to run mpm install
04:40:37.958 so I'll just go ahead say mpm install
04:40:40.080 once again
04:40:43.680 and run our
04:40:45.360 application and reload it with
04:40:49.320 r let's say dism preload this once again
04:40:53.878 we should be good to go okay so I was
04:40:56.638 going to say there is one more thing
04:40:58.400 that I would like to fix I think it is
04:41:00.920 in the post comment I mean post
04:41:04.080 component let's find it post.
04:41:09.480 DSX so at the very bottom no it's not
04:41:12.878 here so there was a component that I'd
04:41:15.638 like
04:41:16.400 to take let me just see I think it is
04:41:19.840 under the homepage okay so instead of
04:41:22.600 having this right here I would like to
04:41:25.000 take this and put it into its own
04:41:27.798 component I mean into its own file so
04:41:30.400 I'll just say stories.
04:41:33.560 TSX grab this completely paste this in
04:41:37.958 and I'll just say export const and and
04:41:41.320 maybe let's just do export
04:41:43.320 default let's just be consistent let's
04:41:46.560 get this scroll view get these Styles I
04:41:49.360 think it is feed let's get the stories
04:41:51.920 and the story
04:41:53.400 component now we'll go ahead and try to
04:41:55.798 import it let's save you can do the same
04:41:58.718 thing for this one but I'll just leave
04:42:00.560 it as it is okay so with that that's
04:42:03.360 going to be it for this section as well
04:42:06.000 let's clear the Imports let's say
04:42:07.798 command shift p organize Imports and
04:42:10.560 let's save it
04:42:11.760 so I'll see you in the next section now
04:42:13.760 it is time to build the profile screen
04:42:16.480 which is going to look like this so we
04:42:18.878 will have the user information at the
04:42:21.520 top with the stats then we will be able
04:42:24.280 to edit our profile when we click to
04:42:26.840 this button this model will show up and
04:42:30.160 we should be able to save the changes we
04:42:32.600 are going to display the posts and then
04:42:35.200 when we click to a post it will open up
04:42:37.718 in a model just like this so with
04:42:40.320 everything that you have learned so far
04:42:42.440 you can build all these functionalities
04:42:44.840 by yourself just keep that in mind and
04:42:47.560 now just for the sake of tutorial let me
04:42:49.840 go ahead and show you every single step
04:42:52.520 so first things first before we try to
04:42:54.958 build the UI once again we would like to
04:42:57.718 add our functions so I will go under the
04:43:00.560 posts and we would like to add a query
04:43:04.200 let's shrink this mutation and at this
04:43:07.160 point I will just go ahead paste this in
04:43:10.798 let me is Shing the left hand side so
04:43:13.160 this is a query where we would like to
04:43:15.080 get posts by a user and this user ID
04:43:18.600 will be optional because if we are
04:43:20.920 looking our own profile we don't really
04:43:23.080 need to pass a user ID right we would
04:43:25.798 like to get our own posts so here we'll
04:43:28.958 just say if user already existed then go
04:43:31.840 ahead find that profile but if it is not
04:43:34.440 existed then this user will be the
04:43:37.080 currently authenticated user and just
04:43:39.878 add an if check in case user not found
04:43:43.320 then we're going to go ahead get the
04:43:44.958 posts for this current user and then we
04:43:48.040 will return the posts out of this query
04:43:50.878 now if you're asking why is this
04:43:52.920 optional once again because in our
04:43:56.680 profile in our profile page we don't
04:43:59.120 really need to add a user ID but if we
04:44:02.000 are looking to other user profiles such
04:44:04.680 as this one then we need to add a user
04:44:07.240 ID so that we can get that profile I
04:44:09.718 hope that makes sense let's go back this
04:44:12.280 is the function let's save the other
04:44:14.920 function that we would like to add will
04:44:16.760 be related to users so let's open this
04:44:20.480 up and this will be a mutation once
04:44:23.680 again I would like to copy and paste
04:44:26.000 because at this point we know everything
04:44:27.840 about convex the only thing we need to
04:44:30.520 do is just type this out pretty quickly
04:44:33.958 so we are going to get two different
04:44:35.840 arguments I don't know why I tried to
04:44:37.798 delete them but here we go we are going
04:44:40.520 to get the full name to be able to
04:44:42.360 update it as well as the bio then we'll
04:44:45.280 have a Handler function which will get
04:44:47.600 the current user and it we will try to
04:44:51.120 update these
04:44:53.400 fields okay so that was the mutation
04:44:56.000 that we would
04:44:57.200 need now we can go into the app tabs and
04:45:01.560 find the profile page or the profile
04:45:04.320 screen I should say now let's try to
04:45:06.638 build it so in this page we are going to
04:45:09.160 have this icon or this touchable opacity
04:45:12.520 to be able to log out so for that reason
04:45:15.520 I will go ahead get the use oath from
04:45:18.520 Expo Clerk and then we would like to
04:45:21.200 have a state this is going to check if
04:45:24.040 the edit model is visible or Not by
04:45:27.680 default this is going to be false and
04:45:29.840 then we would like to get the current
04:45:31.560 user by this query that we have created
04:45:35.000 already and we have used this in the
04:45:37.200 past so we'll just say this is the clerk
04:45:40.280 ID and instead of doing it like this I
04:45:42.798 think we can just say if user ID existed
04:45:47.000 go ahead run this query but else you can
04:45:49.878 skip
04:45:51.280 that okay so this is what we have for
04:45:54.480 the current user and then for the edited
04:45:57.638 profile info so just think about it when
04:46:00.958 we click to this button we are going to
04:46:03.040 see the model and by the default like by
04:46:06.480 default we'll like to get the full name
04:46:08.560 and the current bio and then we can
04:46:11.638 either write something on top of it or
04:46:14.280 we can just change it completely so for
04:46:16.840 this we'll like to have a state let me
04:46:19.440 grab
04:46:20.440 this I'll just paste it right here which
04:46:23.680 is the edited profile and set edit
04:46:26.878 edited profile okay default name and bio
04:46:30.200 by default these are the fields that we
04:46:32.680 have and then we are going to need one
04:46:34.760 more state so when we click to this post
04:46:38.280 this will be the selected post so that
04:46:40.558 we can and show it inside the
04:46:42.920 model right so I will have my state
04:46:46.520 let's say const selected post and set
04:46:49.718 selected post now if you don't really
04:46:52.480 add this type this is completely fine
04:46:55.240 but we would like to let typescript know
04:46:58.080 that this will be type of post and this
04:47:00.840 is how we can do it convex gives you
04:47:03.360 this dog or document and you just say
04:47:06.718 which type this is so you can either say
04:47:08.798 it's going to be coming from users table
04:47:11.080 but in our case this is going to be a
04:47:12.760 post or by default it'll be null so here
04:47:16.160 we go it is null by default then we
04:47:18.878 would like to get the posts by user and
04:47:22.400 since this is our own profile we don't
04:47:24.440 really need to add any arguments so I
04:47:26.878 just leave this as empty then we would
04:47:29.638 like to call our mutation as well so
04:47:32.280 let's go ahead and grab this use
04:47:34.440 mutation under the users we have this
04:47:37.320 update profile
04:47:38.920 mutation and then we are going to have
04:47:41.520 last two functions let's say con handle
04:47:45.360 edit profile this is going to be an
04:47:49.200 arrow function let's
04:47:51.240 say let's leave it as it is for now and
04:47:54.360 I will duplicate this and let's say
04:47:57.280 handle um let's just say save
04:48:02.558 profile and this will be an asyn
04:48:05.600 function just like that and you know
04:48:08.200 what my apologies we don't really need
04:48:10.400 this fun function the only function we
04:48:12.120 need is this handle save profile and we
04:48:15.000 are going to call this once we click to
04:48:17.280 this
04:48:18.240 button okay so with this now I think we
04:48:20.878 can build the UI so first I'll just say
04:48:24.080 if we don't have the current user or if
04:48:26.878 we are in the loading State go ahead
04:48:29.320 show a loader component but else we can
04:48:32.878 return our actual view so this will be a
04:48:36.200 really long return statement but let's
04:48:38.480 try to build it step by step
04:48:41.280 we are going to say styles. container
04:48:44.360 and I think these Styles will be coming
04:48:47.878 from a different file that we need to
04:48:49.798 create let's say profile do styles. yes
04:48:56.080 once again I will grab this from giab
04:48:58.360 repo paste this in this is one of the
04:49:01.360 longest
04:49:02.360 ones let me show this entire
04:49:05.718 file okay so this is what we have I'll
04:49:09.080 just scroll really slowly
04:49:23.680 okay so that's what we have I'll just
04:49:25.480 save you can grab this from the GitHub
04:49:27.798 repo and let's get the styles from the
04:49:31.160 profile Styles file and let me see the
04:49:34.520 entire view inside this view we would
04:49:37.600 like to have the header which will have
04:49:40.320 the
04:49:41.320 username as well as the logout Button as
04:49:44.240 you can tell so here I would like to
04:49:46.718 just grab this it is around 10 lines of
04:49:49.558 code let's get the touch touchable
04:49:52.878 opacity the ion icons as well as the
04:49:55.920 colors let's save this is what we got
04:49:59.000 our username as well as the logout
04:50:01.360 button once we collect it it just signs
04:50:04.718 signs us out right then after this we
04:50:08.200 would like to put a scroll View
04:50:12.280 and then this is going to take the show
04:50:14.558 vertical scroll indicator to be pulse we
04:50:17.680 don't really want to show this at all in
04:50:19.558 our application and then we would like
04:50:21.798 to have one view that will be the
04:50:24.240 container for profile info let's close
04:50:27.638 this off and inside we would like to
04:50:30.160 have
04:50:31.440 Avatar and
04:50:33.798 stats so so like number of followers
04:50:37.000 following so on and so forth so here let
04:50:40.160 me just say save to get this
04:50:44.440 formatting and then paste this in close
04:50:47.280 this off we have Avatar and stats class
04:50:51.040 and on top of it we will have one more
04:50:54.000 view that will have the image this is
04:50:57.360 coming from Expo image and we're going
04:50:59.400 to put the current user image so once I
04:51:02.280 save this is the output that we got so
04:51:05.320 outside of this view we would like to
04:51:07.520 put the stats container so let me go
04:51:10.638 ahead grab this again it is around 10
04:51:13.320 lines of code so we have two different
04:51:16.080 texts so let me just save and see the
04:51:18.360 output there we go this is what we have
04:51:20.320 just added then on top of this view we
04:51:23.840 would like to put the full name as well
04:51:26.120 as the user bio and we only want to show
04:51:29.440 the bio if it is existed so we just have
04:51:32.920 a conditional styling here okay seems
04:51:35.958 like we are missing something maybe this
04:51:38.360 should
04:51:39.120 be oops outside of here let's
04:51:43.110 [Music]
04:51:44.400 see okay now this is actually working so
04:51:47.360 just double check that you are under
04:51:49.600 three different views and then you add
04:51:51.840 the text right
04:51:54.718 here okay then we would like to add the
04:51:57.680 action buttons so I will go ahead paste
04:52:01.120 them here on press let's just delete
04:52:04.360 that save so this is what we have this
04:52:07.520 doesn't do anything this is just for
04:52:09.638 decoration you can add the actual
04:52:12.080 functionality but I'll just skip that
04:52:14.440 and let's say when we click to this when
04:52:17.080 we click to this edit profile button we
04:52:21.080 would like to just change our state so
04:52:24.400 I'll just say on press make this state
04:52:27.440 to be true and depending on this state
04:52:29.878 we would like to show our model so for
04:52:33.760 now let's save and let me show you the
04:52:35.600 entire thing like this and then after
04:52:39.360 this touchable AAC
04:52:41.120 after these two views I will say if the
04:52:44.440 number of posts is equal to zero I would
04:52:47.440 like to show this component which is
04:52:49.760 around 10 lines of code once again let's
04:52:53.480 just say function no post found this is
04:52:56.240 the content we just say no posts yet
04:52:59.798 okay then after this like below to it we
04:53:02.680 would like to show the actual posts and
04:53:05.958 for this we are going to be using
04:53:07.600 flatlist and let me turn this off the
04:53:10.760 data that we would like to map through
04:53:12.638 will be posts let's say number of
04:53:15.000 columns this is something that we have
04:53:16.760 used for the first time in flat list but
04:53:20.120 here we go then let's say scroll
04:53:23.200 enabled let's say this will be false
04:53:26.120 they shouldn't be able to scroll and for
04:53:28.798 the render item we can show a post
04:53:31.520 component but in this case I'll just put
04:53:33.958 it in line and I'll just show the image
04:53:37.440 itself okay just a simple image and when
04:53:40.520 we collected this will set the selected
04:53:43.360 post so that we can let me show
04:53:47.440 this oops so that when we click to a
04:53:50.680 post we should be able to show a
04:53:53.680 model
04:53:57.200 okay so this is what we have the flat
04:53:59.920 list we're going to save and go back
04:54:02.680 here by the way we got the UI we can
04:54:05.080 collect it nothing happens we can
04:54:06.920 collect it this nothing happens but
04:54:09.120 let's make it work below to this scroll
04:54:11.520 view we're going to have two different
04:54:13.558 models so one for the edit profile model
04:54:17.878 and then the other one let's say
04:54:20.718 selected image model let's start with
04:54:23.840 the simplest one which is this model I
04:54:27.440 would like to give you the code it's
04:54:29.878 around 20 lines of code here let me walk
04:54:33.280 you through it so we're going to get the
04:54:35.320 model from react native we will say
04:54:37.760 animation type will be fate transparent
04:54:40.120 of true and when we close it it should
04:54:43.160 set the selected post to be null and
04:54:45.798 here it will be visible depending on the
04:54:48.160 state now since this is an object we
04:54:50.600 would like to convert this into a bullan
04:54:53.040 so we just put double bang operators
04:54:55.760 once again super simple JavaScript trick
04:54:58.040 that you should know then we have a view
04:55:00.760 with some styling if there is a selected
04:55:03.400 post we are going to see this part so I
04:55:06.920 think we don't really need to add this
04:55:08.400 check but if we don't add it this is not
04:55:11.400 really happy with us so that's why we
04:55:13.680 have that let's save and test this out
04:55:16.718 here we go if I click to this this one
04:55:19.280 is selected if we click to this okay you
04:55:22.840 get the point it works and when you
04:55:24.878 click to the close button it sets the
04:55:28.000 states to be
04:55:29.520 null so with this now we can add the
04:55:32.600 actual model the one and only edit
04:55:35.798 profile model which will slide down from
04:55:39.360 the bottom of the screen screen right
04:55:41.080 it'll be
04:55:43.040 animated so I think this will be around
04:55:45.600 50 lines of code I can copy it and paste
04:55:49.000 it then we'll go through it
04:55:51.558 slowly so I am just trying to do
04:55:54.280 everything to not type this out I hope
04:55:57.480 nobody gets annoyed by this because like
04:56:00.480 I am more on the explaining part of the
04:56:03.558 tutorials rather than typing everything
04:56:05.878 out I think it just doesn't make sense
04:56:08.280 at this point we are I think four to
04:56:11.200 five hours in and you should be able to
04:56:15.160 understand everything that we just copy
04:56:16.920 and paste so let me import everything
04:56:19.520 and we will take a look at the
04:56:23.320 code okay so we have just imported from
04:56:28.000 like this entire model once again we
04:56:30.520 have our animation type divisible
04:56:32.798 bullion transparent and close function
04:56:36.320 then we have touchable without feedback
04:56:38.920 we don't really want to get any feedback
04:56:40.958 so this is one of those components that
04:56:42.760 you can use and then on press we'll just
04:56:45.360 say dismiss the keyboard so let's save
04:56:48.958 see the output and then I'll explain the
04:56:51.440 rest so if we clict to this our state
04:56:54.600 becomes true and you are able to see the
04:56:57.360 model which is this view then here we
04:57:00.240 say once again like use the keyboard
04:57:03.760 avoiding view make sure that behavior is
04:57:06.638 working correctly depending on the
04:57:08.600 platform and then we have have this edit
04:57:11.718 profile header which is this part then
04:57:15.160 we have the name we have a text input
04:57:19.120 and once you type something in it will
04:57:21.320 update the state here we go and it will
04:57:24.280 only update the full name then we have
04:57:26.798 the exact same thing for the biography
04:57:29.680 right and at the moment we don't have
04:57:32.160 any value so it is null we're going to
04:57:35.320 fix it or we are going to add something
04:57:37.440 I was going to say and then once we
04:57:39.600 click to the save changes button we are
04:57:42.600 calling this function so let's go ahead
04:57:45.400 and create that then we will try to
04:57:47.920 actually update our profile so here I'll
04:57:51.240 just scroll to the very top and here
04:57:54.680 basically we would like to call our
04:57:56.798 mutation so I'll just say update profile
04:57:59.440 and we are going to add the edited
04:58:01.798 profile state which has the full name as
04:58:04.638 well as the bio then once we edit like
04:58:07.920 once we save this update the profile
04:58:10.120 profile we would like to make this state
04:58:12.280 to be false so that this model would
04:58:14.878 close Okay that was a lot of different
04:58:17.520 things now let's actually test this out
04:58:20.160 I'll click here and I'll just add one
04:58:22.280 two three at the end of my name and then
04:58:24.958 I'll just say hey
04:58:29.240 everyone let's save the changes here we
04:58:32.280 go looks like it has been updated we can
04:58:34.600 just double check by taking a look to
04:58:37.680 our database this is the new bio
04:58:40.878 and this is the new full name here we
04:58:44.360 can
04:58:45.080 see and let's try to build it with the
04:58:49.040 like let's try to test this with the
04:58:51.080 actual keyboard so I'll go ahead press
04:58:54.440 command shift
04:58:56.558 K as we can tell the view is like
04:59:02.520 keyword keyboard is in the view all
04:59:05.320 right and there isn't really any issues
04:59:08.840 on this side as well
04:59:11.958 okay I'll just
04:59:14.000 say um maybe I can just disable the
04:59:17.360 keyboard it's kind of annoying because
04:59:20.040 while it is open you cannot really type
04:59:22.280 type out with your actual keyboard so
04:59:24.520 I'll just say sve and we can delete this
04:59:27.718 one two three and there is like
04:59:29.878 correction if you can see I believe we
04:59:32.558 can turn this off as
04:59:35.160 well I don't really remember the exact
04:59:38.200 prop but if you go into this text input
04:59:42.080 for the bio let's say completion do we
04:59:45.878 have anything like that like autoc
04:59:48.680 complete and let's see what this does
04:59:51.638 specific autoc complete hints for the
04:59:56.000 system so I think it should be autoc
04:59:58.360 complete and we can just say this will
05:00:00.320 be off is this the case okay we have off
05:00:03.718 like bunch of different things that I
05:00:05.480 don't even know that was
05:00:08.638 existed but yeah basically this is how
05:00:10.920 we can explore different things so let's
05:00:13.840 just say it will be sve just like that
05:00:16.440 save and here we go now that our profile
05:00:20.000 page also works the only thing that we
05:00:22.440 left is the user profile so when we
05:00:26.040 click to other user profiles we're going
05:00:28.400 to see this page as you can tell we will
05:00:31.360 be able to follow them and unfollow them
05:00:35.120 so this is what we're going to build
05:00:36.798 next so in this page we are going to
05:00:39.400 need couple of different functions and
05:00:42.120 specifically we're going to need two
05:00:44.360 different queries and one mutation and
05:00:47.440 let's see what they are so let's start
05:00:49.680 with the queries the very first query
05:00:52.280 that we're going to need is to fetch the
05:00:54.440 user profile and then the other one is
05:00:57.120 to check if we are following this user
05:00:59.718 or not depending on that we will either
05:01:02.160 show this follow button or unfollow
05:01:04.760 button and then the mutation will be as
05:01:08.878 you can tell like follow or unfollow
05:01:11.958 functionality okay so we're going to
05:01:13.718 just toggle the follow state so before
05:01:16.360 we start building the uii let's go ahead
05:01:19.200 and create our convex functions then
05:01:22.040 we'll just jump into the UI okay so I'll
05:01:25.200 go under the
05:01:26.760 posts and I don't know if you have
05:01:29.040 realized so maybe you had a question you
05:01:31.360 said why don't we have a query to fetch
05:01:33.920 the posts but we don't really need to
05:01:36.480 build it because we have already done
05:01:39.000 that right get posts by user and we're
05:01:42.080 going to pass the user ID and we'll just
05:01:44.638 collect every single post that this user
05:01:48.000 has okay so let me just make this entire
05:01:51.320 screen so that we can see it clearly and
05:01:53.878 I'll just get my very first query which
05:01:57.120 is to get user profile let's say query
05:02:02.080 at this point you should be able to do
05:02:03.680 this in seconds but I'll just type this
05:02:06.320 out let's say we're going to pass an ID
05:02:09.120 which will be the US user ID and then we
05:02:11.160 would like to go ahead and get the user
05:02:14.000 let's just add an if check where we say
05:02:16.120 if there is not user throw an error but
05:02:18.878 else go ahead and return
05:02:22.080 that okay so that that was the very
05:02:24.958 first query the other one is to check if
05:02:27.718 we are following this user or not so
05:02:30.520 I'll just paste this and then walk you
05:02:32.080 through it it's around 10 lines of code
05:02:35.040 okay so it is called is following and
05:02:37.240 we're going to pass the ID of the user
05:02:39.600 so so that we know if we are following
05:02:41.760 this user or not we'll get the
05:02:43.878 authenticated user and then we'll just
05:02:46.160 check for a document under the follows
05:02:49.200 table and we'll say hey if we are the
05:02:52.638 follower and if this is the
05:02:55.200 following that means we are already
05:02:57.600 following this account right because we
05:02:59.718 are the follower of that user then like
05:03:03.520 we'll get the first result this will be
05:03:06.040 an object or null and if you want to
05:03:08.798 convert this into a bullion we would use
05:03:11.320 our JavaScript trick so we're going to
05:03:13.558 put double bang operator so if you
05:03:16.280 follow I mean if you hover over this you
05:03:19.400 can see we are returning a Boolean okay
05:03:22.958 so that was the very last query but we
05:03:26.718 we need one more mutation okay so let's
05:03:29.558 just try to type this out this will be a
05:03:31.920 bit longer but I think it is nothing
05:03:34.200 complicated so let's say export const
05:03:37.240 toggle follow just like this this is is
05:03:39.878 going to be a mutation and once again
05:03:42.120 we'll get an argument so that we know
05:03:44.600 which user that we are trying to follow
05:03:47.040 or unfollow then let's get the Handler
05:03:51.200 function just like this we're going to
05:03:53.558 get the currently authenticated user and
05:03:56.360 then just like what we have done above
05:03:58.760 I'll just copy this if you really want
05:04:01.200 to you can make this a reusable function
05:04:04.320 but I'll just say you know copy and
05:04:06.638 paste and I will call this as existing
05:04:09.320 so if this is already existed that means
05:04:11.798 we are following this user and you would
05:04:14.638 like to unfollow it so say if existing
05:04:17.400 do it this else do this here we would
05:04:20.798 like to
05:04:22.200 unfollow right and then here we would
05:04:24.600 like to
05:04:26.440 follow okay now if we want to unfollow
05:04:29.958 that means we would like to delete a
05:04:32.080 document and specifically we would like
05:04:34.638 to delete the follow document and then
05:04:37.480 we would like to decrement the number of
05:04:40.798 following let me show this we are going
05:04:43.638 to decrement the number of following of
05:04:46.638 this user or I should say okay let me
05:04:49.400 just tell you from scratch if we want to
05:04:52.080 unfollow this user we would like to
05:04:54.240 decrement the number of followers of
05:04:56.240 this user and we would like to decrement
05:04:58.638 the following count of our own account
05:05:01.798 right so I hope that makes sense let's
05:05:04.280 go ahead and try to do it since this
05:05:07.040 will be reusable I'll just create a
05:05:09.200 function called update follow counts and
05:05:14.200 we're going to pass the
05:05:16.878 context current user ID and following ID
05:05:22.040 which is coming from arguments and then
05:05:24.680 we'll just say true or false so in this
05:05:27.320 case this will be false here it will be
05:05:29.400 true I know this doesn't make any sense
05:05:31.958 but we will create it in a second and it
05:05:34.400 should be clear and then if we are
05:05:36.638 following that means we would like to
05:05:38.920 create a document so let's say context.
05:05:42.480 DB insert into the follows table and
05:05:45.718 this is the document that we would like
05:05:47.240 to insert so we're going to put the
05:05:49.680 follower ID and then the following
05:05:52.558 ID okay once we have done this we would
05:05:55.080 like to do the same
05:05:57.000 thing because we would like to increment
05:05:59.638 the number of these values and the you
05:06:03.920 know the same arguments will be added
05:06:06.160 but this will be true which means like
05:06:09.120 if we are following or unfollowing okay
05:06:13.000 so hopefully here we should be good to
05:06:15.200 go and you know we are missing something
05:06:17.718 else which is to create a notification
05:06:21.080 right and here I'll go ahead copy and
05:06:25.360 paste this is something that we have
05:06:27.440 done multiple times at this point we'll
05:06:29.680 just insert under the notifications a
05:06:32.440 type of follow docu a follow
05:06:35.040 notification right and here is the
05:06:37.240 receiver and sender is the current user
05:06:40.638 now let's build this function so I think
05:06:43.638 I can provide this to you once again
05:06:46.280 it's around 10 lines of
05:06:48.320 code okay so first we get the mutation
05:06:51.440 context so since this is coming from a
05:06:54.400 mutation right this is the context that
05:06:57.480 we are passing let's say type of this is
05:06:59.958 mutation context and then we got the
05:07:02.360 follower ID and following ID which are
05:07:05.440 the type of user ID and then is follow
05:07:08.480 Boolean
05:07:10.200 so this code is pretty easy to
05:07:12.120 understand we get both of these
05:07:14.320 documents then like if you don't add
05:07:17.080 this part types script will be a bit mad
05:07:20.040 that's why we are adding it and then we
05:07:22.400 just say go ahead update these values so
05:07:26.440 following uh the number of following
05:07:29.240 either will be incremented or
05:07:31.320 decremented and same for the followers
05:07:34.878 and how can we check for the increment
05:07:37.120 or decrement it'll be depending on this
05:07:39.958 buan which we have here so either false
05:07:43.200 or true so all in all this function
05:07:47.000 allows you to follow or unfollow right
05:07:50.320 as the name suggests so I think you can
05:07:52.840 pause the video if you didn't really
05:07:55.080 understand it even though there is there
05:07:57.760 isn't anything complex but I can feel
05:08:00.558 this might look a little bit weird if
05:08:02.320 you are kind of like a beginner so once
05:08:05.480 you have once you are done with it we
05:08:08.040 can go ahead and try to build our UI for
05:08:10.878 the user page and just before we build
05:08:13.520 the UI I'd like to show you this image
05:08:16.718 so I don't know if you have realized it
05:08:18.638 but this is not part of the navigation
05:08:21.878 right and let's take a look at it okay
05:08:24.520 all these Pages all these screens are
05:08:27.480 part of the navigation but here this is
05:08:30.040 not the case so we would like to go
05:08:32.120 ahead and put it outside of the tabs
05:08:35.760 folder because anything anything that
05:08:38.000 you put here under this folder will be a
05:08:41.440 will be a tab right if I can correctly
05:08:44.320 then let's go ahead create this screen I
05:08:47.280 will call this as user and this could be
05:08:49.798 dynamic right we could have millions of
05:08:52.400 different users so that means there
05:08:54.360 could be millions of different screens
05:08:57.600 since this will be a dynamic screen
05:08:59.680 we're going to put these square brackets
05:09:01.958 this is how we will make it work we'll
05:09:03.958 just say id. TSX you can call this
05:09:07.360 anything like username but we will be
05:09:09.878 fetching the user profiles depending on
05:09:12.200 their IDs that's why I'll just call it
05:09:14.440 as ID then we will like to have a layout
05:09:17.920 file we'll say layout. TSX this will be
05:09:22.080 a really simple file let me just type
05:09:25.120 this out let's say
05:09:28.480 rnf so we can just call this as user
05:09:32.798 layout and instead of view and text we
05:09:35.680 would like to basically return the stack
05:09:42.000 let's get it from the export router and
05:09:44.200 then I'll just say screen options we we
05:09:47.440 don't really want to show the headers
05:09:50.120 okay now let's
05:09:53.360 save and we would like to build this
05:09:55.638 page now I'll just say rnf let's say
05:09:58.520 user
05:10:00.080 profile page or I think we should call
05:10:02.760 it as
05:10:04.400 screen give a bit space and save now
05:10:07.680 we'll like to build the actual
05:10:11.320 content let's just make them to look
05:10:14.000 correctly
05:10:16.160 okay so here I'll just go inside and we
05:10:19.798 would like to call some queries so first
05:10:22.638 let's try to get the profile of the user
05:10:26.320 now this is not the page that we are
05:10:27.920 trying to build this is our own profile
05:10:30.480 the page that we are trying to build
05:10:33.080 will be the profile of others right so
05:10:35.440 when we click to this we should be taken
05:10:38.360 into this page
05:10:40.440 so let's say profile and I'll just shink
05:10:42.600 the left hand side give a little bit
05:10:44.600 space let's say use Query get it from
05:10:48.200 the convex and I'll just say get the
05:10:51.760 api. users and get
05:10:55.280 user profile I was going to say but why
05:10:58.680 don't we have this function get
05:11:02.280 user profile so I don't know why but I
05:11:06.200 have just put this into the posts
05:11:09.400 I think this doesn't really make any
05:11:11.000 sense this is not related to posts so
05:11:13.400 I'll go ahead cut it from here and
05:11:16.120 actually I'll I'll cut all of these
05:11:19.120 right they all are related to users so
05:11:24.200 I'll just cut everything save this file
05:11:27.040 go into the convex folder and under the
05:11:30.878 users file so I'll just paste this
05:11:34.520 in let's get the ID
05:11:40.200 okay now everything should be happy with
05:11:43.120 us we just have all these queries and
05:11:46.958 mutations and one helper function okay
05:11:50.040 now let's save showing the left hand
05:11:52.040 side this should be happy with us now
05:11:54.480 let's say get user profile now this
05:11:57.000 wants you to put an argument right which
05:11:59.760 is the ID and how do we get this ID from
05:12:03.878 the file name so this will be coming
05:12:06.600 from a hook let's say const
05:12:10.280 use local search prems and we can
05:12:13.878 destructure the value which is going to
05:12:16.200 be ID so if you call this file as hello
05:12:19.680 you would say grab me that right but in
05:12:22.360 our case it is called as ID so this is
05:12:24.958 how we get that and here this says like
05:12:28.878 let's just add it ID as ID but now this
05:12:32.040 says this is type of string or an array
05:12:34.958 of strings but we are expecting a type
05:12:38.200 of user right here
05:12:39.840 right so let's make the typescript happy
05:12:42.120 and just say this will
05:12:44.000 be ID of users just like that now this
05:12:47.320 is happy with us now the other query
05:12:49.878 that we'd like to do let's just
05:12:51.680 duplicate that it will be posts we'll
05:12:55.040 say API get user
05:12:58.638 profile in the same way this wants us to
05:13:02.400 put an ID so here we go and finally
05:13:06.040 we'll like to get our mutation so let's
05:13:08.360 say const is
05:13:10.600 following I think this is also the query
05:13:13.480 not mutation let's say is following I'll
05:13:16.400 just outo accept this here we go this is
05:13:20.080 working correctly then we can get our
05:13:22.600 mutation which is called as toggle
05:13:25.920 follow we'll say use
05:13:29.480 mutation okay this is the mutation that
05:13:32.520 we have we are going to have a function
05:13:35.000 called handle back for now let's just
05:13:37.840 leave it as an empty Arrow function we
05:13:40.120 will implement this later in the video
05:13:43.400 and let's handle the loader case I'll
05:13:46.240 just say let me grab the entire thing it
05:13:48.638 is just a simple if check so if profile
05:13:51.480 is undefined and if you remember in
05:13:53.798 convex if something is equal to
05:13:55.760 undefined that means you are in the Lo
05:13:57.520 loing state so basically we check any of
05:14:00.000 these are in the All loing State we're
05:14:02.520 going to show a loader component which
05:14:04.958 is something that we have created
05:14:07.480 already then we and go and jump into the
05:14:10.840 return
05:14:11.680 statement let's delete this part
05:14:14.000 completely and here is going to be our
05:14:17.718 container now this is related to user
05:14:20.760 profile and I believe the Styles will be
05:14:23.760 coming from the profile. Styles then we
05:14:27.480 would like to add the
05:14:29.440 header section which is going to be this
05:14:32.280 part so we have an icon and then the
05:14:35.200 user like username right I would like to
05:14:38.600 grab this put it which is around five
05:14:41.320 lines of code I'll save to get the
05:14:43.600 formatting let's get this component
05:14:46.160 icons and then the
05:14:49.160 colors all we do is
05:14:51.680 to just show the user profile name right
05:14:56.120 I mean username so let's go ahead and
05:14:58.680 try to see this page how can we make
05:15:00.878 this work let's go under the
05:15:03.000 notifications page under the tabs so
05:15:06.680 when we click to a link
05:15:10.798 so under the
05:15:13.520 notification so we are just taking this
05:15:15.638 user to the notifications page but we
05:15:18.160 have a too now let's just fix it now
05:15:21.600 when we click to it we'll just say take
05:15:23.520 them to the user page and here is the
05:15:27.440 entire entire URL so let's save I'll
05:15:31.320 just click to this it says this page
05:15:34.280 does not found but this is not correct
05:15:36.360 let's go ahead press R when you add a
05:15:39.040 new page I think you should reload your
05:15:41.320 application Let's test this out once
05:15:43.480 again I'll click to
05:15:45.638 this okay so here it says value does not
05:15:49.000 match
05:15:50.360 validator let's take a look at
05:15:54.400 it so we got the ID I'd like to just
05:15:57.600 console log it what do we get let's say
05:16:00.520 ID is here
05:16:10.638 so I just found a solution it was a
05:16:12.760 silly mistake by AI in conx we don't
05:16:16.160 really have ID but instead we have
05:16:18.200 underscore ID right so ID just returns
05:16:21.558 undefined we should fix it now let's
05:16:24.120 save and test this out if you click to
05:16:27.080 this profile it should take us to there
05:16:29.280 and here is what we can see okay now I
05:16:31.878 hope that makes sense let's go ahead
05:16:34.120 sharing this left hand side delete that
05:16:37.120 and build the rest of the UI
05:16:39.718 now what are we going to have is this
05:16:42.200 remaining part and I will just put them
05:16:44.360 under a scroll view so let's go back put
05:16:48.120 them side by side and import a scroll
05:16:51.718 view let's say close this
05:16:55.638 off and we don't really want to show the
05:16:58.558 scroll indicator then I'll have a view
05:17:01.400 at the very top let's save to get this
05:17:03.680 formatting then this view will have a
05:17:06.080 style let's say styles do I think it
05:17:09.520 should be profile info then inside we're
05:17:12.120 going to have one more view with the
05:17:14.840 style to be styles.
05:17:19.320 Avatar and stats then I'll just grab you
05:17:23.600 the
05:17:25.240 content so this is the Avatar let's get
05:17:28.040 the image from Expo image save there we
05:17:31.240 go next to it we would like to put the
05:17:33.798 stats so just below the image still
05:17:36.680 inside this view I'll just say
05:17:39.800 [Music]
05:17:41.320 stats and then I'll provide you the code
05:17:44.600 which is around once again 10 lines of
05:17:48.480 code okay so here we go number of posts
05:17:51.878 followers and
05:17:54.200 following then after this de I mean
05:17:57.080 after this View and then after this one
05:17:59.760 we would like to go ahead build this
05:18:02.360 full name
05:18:03.638 text this is what we got and if user has
05:18:07.120 a bio we would like to put that that and
05:18:10.080 looks like this user doesn't have it so
05:18:12.120 it is not updating the UI then we would
05:18:15.320 like to have this button and for this
05:18:18.160 I'll be using pressible just to have at
05:18:20.638 least one of them in our code base you
05:18:22.878 can still use touchable opacity but this
05:18:25.798 is what I'll be going
05:18:28.200 with so pressible let's import that and
05:18:31.760 depending on the following State we are
05:18:33.798 going to show a different style and on
05:18:37.558 press we're going to call the
05:18:39.718 call the mutation and pass the following
05:18:42.240 ID if you don't add this part typescript
05:18:44.760 will be unhappy with you so this is what
05:18:47.240 we added depending on the state the
05:18:49.798 button text will change and let's save
05:18:53.360 and test this
05:18:54.958 out here we go I can follow that in real
05:18:58.200 time this has been updated and I can
05:19:00.760 unfollow that user after the pressible
05:19:04.360 and after this view but still inside the
05:19:07.120 scroll view we would like to to create
05:19:09.400 the post grid so here I'll just have a
05:19:12.200 view with the
05:19:14.558 styling to be let's say styles. post
05:19:18.760 grid and inside I like I just need to
05:19:22.638 check the number of posts I'll say
05:19:24.680 posts.
05:19:27.958 length wait why don't we get this
05:19:34.680 posts okay so for some reason posts is
05:19:39.040 not an array why is this the
05:19:42.360 case Okay this should be get user posts
05:19:46.958 but we don't really have
05:19:48.520 it maybe it should be under the
05:19:51.798 posts get posts by user and this wants
05:19:57.240 you to add a user
05:20:01.400 ID so if you have realized these
05:20:04.240 mistakes a couple of minutes ago you
05:20:06.680 might be mad at me but I have just
05:20:08.240 realized
05:20:10.320 okay now we can just say posts and we
05:20:12.440 can get the length now it is an array
05:20:14.958 and if it is equal to zero we would like
05:20:17.920 to do
05:20:19.200 something like this and in the else case
05:20:22.000 we would like to show something else and
05:20:24.480 here I'll just put a placeholder that
05:20:27.200 says no posts yet and then here we'll
05:20:30.958 like to just show a flat list let me
05:20:34.680 grab
05:20:36.680 this so this is what we have done done
05:20:38.878 multiple times where we would like to
05:20:41.400 map through the posts number of colums
05:20:44.718 scroll is not enabled and for each item
05:20:47.840 we would like to render a touchable
05:20:49.798 opacity let's
05:20:51.680 save okay currently this user doesn't
05:20:54.320 really have any posts that's why this is
05:20:57.200 what we see now I don't really know why
05:20:59.760 this is not being centered let's go
05:21:01.920 ahead and fix it let's maybe say Flex
05:21:05.040 will be
05:21:06.558 one okay so probably you already have it
05:21:09.798 in the source code but I have just added
05:21:12.360 that now it's being
05:21:14.558 centered okay so everything is working
05:21:16.958 at the moment we can follow this user we
05:21:19.558 can unfollow them it just works without
05:21:22.280 any issues and just one thing that we
05:21:24.878 are missing is this function like called
05:21:29.040 handle back when we collect this nothing
05:21:31.400 happens and we have attached it to this
05:21:34.440 icon so let's go ahead and build this
05:21:36.638 function so basically we'll using the
05:21:39.718 router I would like to import it let's
05:21:42.480 say use router coming from here and
05:21:45.240 we'll just say const
05:21:47.040 router okay so inside I'll just say if
05:21:51.600 like let's say if router can go back Yep
05:21:55.080 this is something that is available if
05:21:57.200 this is the case we should be able to go
05:22:02.958 back and in the else case we could just
05:22:05.680 say router. replace
05:22:09.680 slash tabs so we're just going to go
05:22:11.638 into the homepage I'll just click to
05:22:14.400 this here we go we can go back to the
05:22:16.480 notifications page then I think there is
05:22:19.840 one more thing that we are missing is
05:22:22.040 that when we click to here nothing
05:22:24.200 happens so let's go ahead and fix that I
05:22:27.200 will go into the post component this is
05:22:30.520 where that is and here here we go like
05:22:34.638 if you remember back in the video I just
05:22:37.320 said we're going to fix this part and
05:22:39.798 let's fix it now this is going to be
05:22:43.120 dynamic value so if post is mine that
05:22:46.520 means the author is me when I click to
05:22:49.080 this it should take me to my own profile
05:22:51.638 tab but if post is posted by someone
05:22:55.638 else it should take us to the user page
05:22:58.680 that we have just created right so here
05:23:01.080 is how we can do it I'll basically paste
05:23:03.440 this in we're going to get the current
05:23:05.638 user let's just put a question mark so
05:23:08.958 we'll say if the post author is me then
05:23:12.400 take me to the profile tab but else take
05:23:15.360 me to that user page let's save I'll
05:23:19.520 click to
05:23:20.600 this nothing happens I think we should
05:23:23.558 say as child right because there's a
05:23:26.798 touchable opacity and we would like to
05:23:29.480 take the link inside of it so this is
05:23:31.680 how we can do it let's save and I'll
05:23:34.120 click to this it should take me to my
05:23:35.958 own profile okay this is how that work
05:23:39.360 if that was a different profile trust me
05:23:41.760 it would take us to that user screen
05:23:44.638 that we have just built so with that
05:23:46.680 that's going to it for the user page
05:23:49.200 there isn't really anything complex that
05:23:51.240 we have implemented it was a pretty
05:23:53.280 basic UI where we just handle a mutation
05:23:56.680 and we have added couple of different
05:23:58.958 queries okay so in the next section
05:24:01.240 we're going to do some fixes and
05:24:03.760 optimizations now let's do some
05:24:05.760 optimizations the very first one is Rel
05:24:08.680 to Android devices so this is an Android
05:24:11.958 device that I actually tested out and
05:24:14.878 I've just realized when you take a look
05:24:17.000 at the navigation bar it is in the White
05:24:20.400 theme so it should be dark I think this
05:24:23.000 doesn't really look nice it would be
05:24:25.360 better if the background is dark and
05:24:28.160 these things are white right these
05:24:30.878 buttons so how can we make this work
05:24:33.638 well thankfully there is something
05:24:36.080 called Expo navigation bar
05:24:39.160 and we'll go under the layout try to get
05:24:42.440 that package so I'll just kill my
05:24:44.600 application clear this up and I'll just
05:24:47.240 say npx Expo install let's say Expo Das
05:24:53.798 navigation dashb
05:24:57.480 bar so this will go ahead and install it
05:25:01.000 while it
05:25:02.360 installs and here we go we got that so
05:25:04.760 let's start our application preloaded
05:25:08.080 okay okay it says no apps connected I'll
05:25:10.440 just press I and then reload
05:25:14.200 okay let's kill the terminal we're going
05:25:17.520 to go ahead and use it so what I'd like
05:25:20.000 to do use a use effect and just try to
05:25:23.840 change the background color as soon as
05:25:26.000 our application starts so first I will
05:25:28.920 get my import just like this I'll say
05:25:32.320 import everything as navigation bar from
05:25:35.040 this package then below to this I'll
05:25:38.440 just say use
05:25:40.520 effect and let's initialize
05:25:44.840 it okay so when our application starts
05:25:48.040 we'll like to check if
05:25:50.600 platform. operating system is equal to
05:25:53.878 Android if this is the case we would
05:25:56.120 like to go ahead run this block and I
05:25:59.000 would like to just basically copy and
05:26:01.200 paste so navigation bar set background
05:26:04.120 color with this black color and then the
05:26:07.480 style will be a light so that these
05:26:10.360 buttons are light and the background
05:26:13.558 will be
05:26:15.360 black okay so once you have done this we
05:26:18.280 can basically save and I'll just add a
05:26:20.798 comment just so that you can have it in
05:26:23.080 the source code now on Android devices
05:26:26.120 this problem should be fixed and I have
05:26:28.440 tested out it is actually working now it
05:26:31.080 is in the dark background color so that
05:26:34.718 was the very first thing that I wanted
05:26:36.680 to mention the other one is is let me
05:26:38.920 take a look at my notes okay so we would
05:26:41.520 like to make the number of likes to work
05:26:44.718 in real time so what do I mean by this
05:26:47.558 now what do I mean by this what does
05:26:49.680 that mean to make this work in real time
05:26:52.280 so let me pretty quickly open up my
05:26:54.360 camera and just show you in real time
05:26:57.480 I'll go ahead and try to scan this QR
05:27:00.798 code let's open up the
05:27:03.120 terminal just like
05:27:06.520 that okay so let's wait a second this
05:27:11.000 should open up the actual application
05:27:13.558 and I'll just log in with my
05:27:27.240 account all right so I am just logged in
05:27:30.320 here we
05:27:31.280 go dude I just got an even email
05:27:34.040 notification but here we go this is the
05:27:36.320 exact same post that you can see on the
05:27:38.600 screen right this is what I have this is
05:27:41.280 what we got here so I will go ahead and
05:27:44.320 unlike this post currently it is liked
05:27:47.958 here you can see and if I unlike that
05:27:51.120 this screen should get updated
05:27:53.360 immediately but notice how I will unlike
05:27:56.080 it it doesn't get updated here right and
05:27:59.680 actually we can make this work in real
05:28:01.638 time because we are using conx so let's
05:28:04.878 go ahead and try to fix the code and
05:28:07.320 then we'll just test it out once again
05:28:10.240 all right so I will kill this file we're
05:28:13.080 going to go under the post
05:28:16.638 component oops let's shink the left hand
05:28:19.600 side so we have this state called likes
05:28:22.558 count but we don't really need to keep
05:28:24.798 it in a state we'll just use it as post.
05:28:27.718 likes so I'll just delete this state and
05:28:31.000 here we have an error instead of likes
05:28:32.920 count we'll just say
05:28:35.000 post. likes
05:28:38.200 okay and then we have one more error
05:28:40.120 let's go here under the handle like we
05:28:42.558 don't really need this function because
05:28:44.718 convex will fix it immediately now in
05:28:47.798 the same way I will go ahead and fix the
05:28:50.480 commment count because at the moment if
05:28:53.000 I try to add a comment from my phone
05:28:56.240 this will not update it for this us for
05:28:58.638 this user right if we delete this
05:29:01.680 part and make the comments to be post.
05:29:07.480 comments
05:29:09.120 dot okay I think that should be it post.
05:29:12.680 comments because it's already number and
05:29:15.480 we can save here we should be able to
05:29:18.480 get rid of this and go into the comments
05:29:22.840 model delete this type delete this
05:29:27.400 prop and delete this call so what we
05:29:31.280 have just done is to get rid of that
05:29:33.320 state so that we don't
05:29:35.798 really so we don't really need them
05:29:37.920 right it will just make it work in real
05:29:39.680 time okay so I'll just open up the
05:29:41.360 terminal and as well as my camera just
05:29:43.638 to show you
05:29:45.798 this so I'll just press r that will
05:29:48.680 reload the
05:29:50.440 application okay just take a look at the
05:29:52.520 screen we have zero likes and here it
05:29:55.520 also has zero likes I'll just go ahead
05:29:58.320 like
05:29:59.280 it and here we can see in real time on
05:30:02.718 the screen for this account it just
05:30:05.000 updated and if I like it here on my
05:30:07.718 phone it should be two
05:30:10.120 likes okay I don't know if you can see
05:30:12.600 it but now it is two likes here as well
05:30:15.040 I will unlike
05:30:17.200 that okay I cannot click
05:30:19.718 it okay now it is just one like let's go
05:30:23.240 ahead and add a comment so I'll just say
05:30:26.400 hey but first let's see there is only
05:30:28.320 one
05:30:30.040 comment hey
05:30:32.240 there and post it okay it just works in
05:30:36.520 real time so I just really wanted to
05:30:38.160 show you the entire process and okay so
05:30:41.840 that was just one optimization that I
05:30:43.558 wanted to add I think it is better to
05:30:45.958 see the numbers increment in real
05:30:49.440 time okay so that's going to be it for
05:30:52.600 this optimization I think there is one
05:30:54.798 more thing now this one that I'll show
05:30:57.040 you is not like an optimization but it
05:30:59.680 is something that I genuinely want to
05:31:01.558 talk about so I will go under the
05:31:04.840 homepage okay so app tabs
05:31:08.600 feed here what do we want to do so when
05:31:11.718 we just try to refresh this right in
05:31:14.520 Instagram this is how that work but here
05:31:16.798 nothing happens but thankfully there is
05:31:19.480 a component for this where we can just
05:31:22.120 make it work right so here first things
05:31:24.600 first I'll just get a state to check the
05:31:28.360 refreshing state so I'll just say by
05:31:30.958 default this is going to be false and
05:31:32.958 let's import the use State and then on
05:31:35.920 refresh we'll do something let's say
05:31:38.280 const on
05:31:39.878 refresh for now let's have an empty
05:31:43.160 function just like that and then we can
05:31:46.160 add it into the flat list I'll just
05:31:49.600 say was it on refresh okay so here we
05:31:53.160 would like to actually render a
05:31:55.760 component and I think it is not on
05:31:58.000 refresh my bad it should be a refresh
05:32:00.520 control the component that we'll like to
05:32:02.958 show will be refresh control coming from
05:32:05.760 react native then we can add couple of
05:32:08.400 different props so here I'll just say
05:32:11.840 refreshing well depending on the state
05:32:14.600 and on refresh what are we going to be
05:32:16.760 doing is to call our function and then
05:32:19.520 the tin color if we really want it to we
05:32:22.160 can customize it and there are bunch of
05:32:24.360 different things that you can take a
05:32:25.718 look after completing this tutorial so
05:32:28.558 let's save and we can try to refresh
05:32:31.160 this here we can see we can actually get
05:32:34.480 that
05:32:36.160 view but nothing happen happens at the
05:32:38.440 moment what we can do on the on refresh
05:32:42.840 method we can actually try to run this
05:32:45.958 query once again right so that we would
05:32:48.440 get the latest posts so here I'll go
05:32:51.480 ahead for now I'll say set refreshing
05:32:54.120 will be equal to True when we run this
05:32:56.240 function and then I'll just say after 2
05:32:59.600 seconds we would like to just say set
05:33:03.280 refreshing to be false So currently this
05:33:07.440 does nothing right the only thing we
05:33:10.200 just update the state as if something is
05:33:12.798 happening behind the scenes so after 2
05:33:15.760 seconds basically nothing happens so if
05:33:18.680 you really want to you can call this
05:33:21.200 query once again and since we are using
05:33:24.520 convex if you really want to refetch a
05:33:27.600 query you can use this package called 10
05:33:31.440 stack query but in our case I just
05:33:34.320 wanted to mention this and I will not be
05:33:37.240 implementing that if you really want to
05:33:39.400 you can have this as a really great to
05:33:43.120 do okay so this is how we can Implement
05:33:46.120 on refresh
05:33:48.000 functionalities let's take a look at our
05:33:50.160 code base if we have any to-dos left
05:33:53.480 basically we fixed it we can delete
05:33:57.200 that and then the other one I think it's
05:34:00.280 in the same
05:34:01.400 page okay we forgot to fix it so let's
05:34:04.200 go ahead and do that this is
05:34:08.798 when we click to the
05:34:11.000 username this should take us to the user
05:34:13.958 profile so just like what we had
05:34:17.160 above I will copy this entire thing and
05:34:21.240 then paste
05:34:22.920 it okay so now if you clict the username
05:34:26.160 it should take you to that profile just
05:34:29.200 like
05:34:31.320 here okay so with that that's going to
05:34:34.000 be it for this section as well so I have
05:34:36.480 just said buy but there is one more
05:34:38.558 thing that I'd like to mention which is
05:34:40.680 that let me open up the camera first so
05:34:43.798 here I just got an Android device and
05:34:46.360 this was the previous device now this is
05:34:48.600 working completely fine this is also
05:34:50.958 working completely fine but there is
05:34:53.360 just one thing that I'd like to mention
05:34:55.760 which is this status bar so let's go
05:34:58.160 ahead and try to make this work with a
05:35:01.240 dark background so here even if there
05:35:05.360 wasn't a problem on this Android device
05:35:07.798 this is the component that I'd like to
05:35:09.718 mention so I just forgot that until now
05:35:12.680 we didn't really need it but here we go
05:35:15.680 we'll just be using it so we're going to
05:35:17.718 get this status bar import from Expo
05:35:20.760 status bar and I'll just put it right
05:35:23.878 below to the save area provider okay so
05:35:27.240 we'll just say status bar we can give it
05:35:29.600 a style like light dark and there is
05:35:33.480 also invert I believe yep we have even
05:35:37.280 out so here let's go with the light
05:35:40.160 since our background is always black
05:35:43.520 this should be a light so that text is
05:35:46.920 white but if you go with dark notice how
05:35:50.120 this will be invisible right and this
05:35:52.798 doesn't really make sense we'll go with
05:35:54.798 the light option and let me open up the
05:35:58.320 camera to show you
05:36:00.760 this so here we can see now it is black
05:36:03.920 it is looking a little bit better if we
05:36:06.280 go with dark
05:36:08.200 oops let me just like delete this and
05:36:11.558 just say
05:36:13.080 dark just like
05:36:15.600 that like the text completely disappears
05:36:19.120 but in our case we' like to have this as
05:36:22.320 light okay so now that this is working I
05:36:25.280 think we can move on with the next
05:36:26.958 section so now that we have an entire
05:36:29.958 application built this is completely
05:36:32.200 ready to be deployed but how do we
05:36:34.840 deploy this so unfortunately it is not
05:36:37.638 not as easy as deploying a web web
05:36:40.558 project right so we cannot really go
05:36:43.320 into verel or render doccom and just
05:36:46.840 drag and drop it this is not how that
05:36:49.040 works there are some good news and bad
05:36:51.520 news the good news are that you can
05:36:54.200 deploy it right you can publish it to
05:36:57.000 Google Play store or App Store the bad
05:36:59.638 news are it just a little bit more
05:37:01.760 involved right so you would need to have
05:37:04.320 a developer account to put your you know
05:37:07.798 application information and then from
05:37:10.120 there you would publish it and I don't
05:37:12.600 know like how long it'll take but I
05:37:14.440 think it is couple of days or maybe
05:37:17.558 weeks I don't really know I I I have
05:37:19.798 never deployed any application to App
05:37:22.200 Stores but I'll just provide you some
05:37:24.600 notes that you can keep in mind so that
05:37:27.480 you just really know the steps okay so
05:37:30.080 I'll just go ahead and paste this in and
05:37:31.920 let me walk you through it so building
05:37:34.000 and Publishing your application you can
05:37:36.638 build your app for production with Expo
05:37:39.718 application services and I have some
05:37:42.320 links that I'll just provide in a second
05:37:44.878 and if you want to submit it to Google
05:37:47.000 Play store or App Store you will need a
05:37:49.600 developer account and then it would take
05:37:52.040 couple of days or weeks as I have just
05:37:54.360 mentioned and then if it is accepted I
05:37:57.360 think it'll just go live immediately and
05:38:00.480 I guess like I believe there is also
05:38:03.200 beta version and then the actual version
05:38:07.920 so if it is not accepted completely the
05:38:10.638 beta version will be live I might be
05:38:12.958 wrong just let me know this is something
05:38:14.840 that I have seen uh haven't really
05:38:17.160 experienced it fully but it's really
05:38:19.840 nice to know this right then here are
05:38:22.760 two different links that you can take a
05:38:25.040 look from the Expo documentation you can
05:38:28.480 build your project for app stores and
05:38:31.240 you can submit it to app stores right
05:38:34.280 and there is even a video explanation so
05:38:37.680 there is really no excuses to not deploy
05:38:41.478 it if you really want to you can like
05:38:44.160 you should definitely take a look at
05:38:45.840 these documentations and just make that
05:38:48.558 work and then what the hell let's delete
05:38:52.080 this then like there are a couple of
05:38:54.478 different steps that I take note and I'd
05:38:57.638 like to walk you through it so first
05:38:59.558 things first you need to visit expo. Dev
05:39:02.280 and sign up so I have just said you can
05:39:04.798 use the EAS to build to our applications
05:39:08.718 and since this is since this is the
05:39:12.040 service of Expo you should visit their
05:39:15.120 website and sign up which is free I
05:39:18.280 believe let's take a look at the pricing
05:39:20.798 here we go like there they have a free
05:39:22.958 plan and 30 mobile application builds
05:39:25.840 per month that's pretty cool
05:39:28.478 right and then like there is even submit
05:39:31.680 to App Store
05:39:34.878 option okay so you just went ahead and
05:39:37.840 signed up then here is what you would do
05:39:40.638 in your terminal install the E EAS CLI
05:39:44.798 globally then you would log in with this
05:39:47.478 command so these are everything that you
05:39:49.400 would do in your terminal right so you
05:39:51.680 would run this one first then this one
05:39:54.280 and then you would say EAS in it and
05:39:57.040 this will ask you to create a project
05:39:59.798 and you can just say
05:40:02.000 yes okay let me just fix that then if
05:40:05.080 you want to build it for Android you
05:40:07.440 should say EAS built platform Android
05:40:11.400 and this will give you an APK file which
05:40:14.520 is the file format that is used by
05:40:17.200 Android operating system to install and
05:40:22.200 distribute uh applications right in the
05:40:25.160 same way you would do it for iOS and
05:40:28.000 then it would give you IPA file so this
05:40:31.478 is for iOS and this is for Android and
05:40:35.040 then you would take those files and sub
05:40:37.280 sub it to play store or App Store so
05:40:41.000 once again there is no excuses to not do
05:40:43.638 these if you really want to and then
05:40:46.080 your actual challenge is to publish this
05:40:48.558 application and if it went live
05:40:51.280 successfully you could let us know and
05:40:54.200 you know I can just do a shout out then
05:40:56.440 we can give you some starts and that
05:40:58.558 would be a really cool project for your
05:41:01.160 resum so with that if you were able to
05:41:03.920 follow along up until now I don't have
05:41:06.718 anything to say other than
05:41:08.520 congratulations it is 3:00 a.m. in the
05:41:10.958 morning and I am going to bed straight

# 📱 React Native Full Stack App Setup – Step-by-Step Guide (Expo + NativeWind)

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Mobile device with **Expo Go**
- IDE (e.g. WebStorm or VS Code)
- Git (optional)

---

## 🚀 1. Project Initialization

```bash
npx create-d-expo-app@latest .
````

Choose a **blank TypeScript template**.

---

## 🧹 2. Clean Boilerplate (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm run reset-project
# Select “Move files to app-example” and delete them
```

---

## 📁 3. Folder Structure (After Reset)

```plaintext
/
├── app/                 # Screens & routes
├── assets/              # Fonts, images
├── constants/           # Theme & design tokens
├── styles/              # Custom styles
├── components/          # Shared components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── app.json             # Expo config
├── babel.config.js      # Babel plugin config
├── tailwind.config.js   # Tailwind/NW config
```

---

## 🎨 4. Install & Setup Tailwind with NativeWind

### A. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install nativewind tailwindcss \
  react-native-reanimated \
  react-native-safe-area-context
```

### B. Tailwind Config

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Update `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#0314ff",
        secondary: "#151312",
        light: {
          100: "#D6C7FF",
          200: "#A8B5DB",
          300: "#9CA4AA"
        },
        dark: {
          100: "#221f3d",
          200: "#0f0d23"
        }
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

---

## ⚙️ 5. Babel & Metro Config Setup

### Babel

Create `babel.config.js` if not already present:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ["babel-preset-expo"],
  plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
};
```

### Metro (if using custom CSS)

```bash
npx expo customize metro.config.js
```

Then wrap config:

```js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { withNativewind } = require("nativewind/metro");

module.exports = withNativewind(getDefaultConfig(__dirname));
```

---

## 🧼 6. Global Styling (Optional but Recommended)

### `app/globals.css`

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Enable Typings (optional but useful)

Create `nativewind-env.d.ts`:

```ts
/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />
```

---

## 💡 7. File-Based Routing with Expo Router

Expo Router uses the file name as the route.

### Example:

```plaintext
app/
├── index.tsx            // Home (/)
├── search.tsx           // Search (/search)
├── saved.tsx            // Bookmarks (/saved)
├── profile.tsx          // Profile (/profile)
├── (tabs)/_layout.tsx   // Tab Navigator Group
├── (auth)/login.tsx     // Route group with auth logic
├── movies/
│   └── [id].tsx         // Dynamic route (/movies/:id)
```

Use `<Link href="/search">` for navigation.

---

## 🧭 8. Navigation Setup (Tab + Stack)

### A. `_layout.tsx` in `app/(tabs)`

```tsx
import { Tabs } from "expo-router";

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen name="index" options={{ title: "Home" }} />
      <Tabs.Screen name="search" />
      <Tabs.Screen name="saved" />
      <Tabs.Screen name="profile" />
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

---

## 💅 9. Applying Tailwind Styles

Use `className` prop:

```tsx
<View className="flex-1 justify-center items-center bg-dark-200">
  <Text className="text-primary text-3xl font-bold">Hello React Native</Text>
</View>
```

---

## 🖼️ 10. Core Components You’ll Use Often

| Component             | Purpose                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `View`                | Wrapper like `div`               |
| `Text`                | For displaying strings           |
| `Image`               | Static and remote images         |
| `ImageBackground`     | Background visuals               |
| `FlatList`            | Large performant lists           |
| `ScrollView`          | Scrollable containers            |
| `SafeAreaView`        | Layout padding for notches etc.  |
| `TouchableOpacity`    | Pressable element (like buttons) |
| `Modal`, `Alert`      | UI dialogs                       |
| `Switch`, `StatusBar` | Controls & status indicator      |

---

## ✅ 11. Test Your Setup

Start the server:

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

Scan the QR code in Expo Go.

If styling isn’t applied:

* Ensure Babel & Metro configs are correct
* Restart with `--clear`
* Confirm Tailwind directives are in `globals.css`

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Create screens with reusable components
* Fetch movie data via 3rd party API
* Add trending algorithm and persistence with database (Convex, Supabase, etc.)
* Implement search functionality
* Set up authentication
* Deploy (EAS Build or Expo Dev Client)

# React Native Course for Beginners in 2025 | Build a Full Stack React Native App
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/f8Z9JyB2EIE

00:00:00.199 the existence of react native makes
00:00:02.600 react one of the most valuable skills
00:00:04.680 you can learn think about it about 75%
00:00:08.160 of what you already know from building
00:00:09.800 websites carries over to mobile
00:00:11.840 development and that's exactly what you
00:00:13.880 learn in this video I used to compare
00:00:15.719 react native to react but now it's more
00:00:18.560 like nygs because now on mobile you can
00:00:21.720 do everything from file based routing
00:00:24.439 and component driven architecture to API
00:00:27.000 routes even react server components
00:00:29.480 react native is evolving fast and this
00:00:32.520 crash course will help you keep up hi
00:00:34.680 there I'm Adrien and welcome to the
00:00:37.280 ultimate react native crash course in
00:00:39.600 this course you'll learn react native
00:00:41.719 from scratch Master the latest features
00:00:44.480 and build a modern fully functional app
00:00:47.600 we'll start with a quick look at react
00:00:49.879 native's Journey why react native is the
00:00:52.280 go-to choice and how it actually works
00:00:54.320 an introduction to Expo the official
00:00:56.760 react native framework mastering core
00:00:59.120 building blocks file structures routing
00:01:01.879 and more and then we'll dive straight
00:01:04.400 into building a fully featured movie app
00:01:07.520 with a home screen that has the top
00:01:09.680 trends feature showing the hottest
00:01:11.479 movies using an algorithm that you'll
00:01:13.799 write and that will power using the open
00:01:16.320 source tool called aite and you'll also
00:01:18.759 be able to see some latest movies here
00:01:20.960 then of course there's the custom tab
00:01:22.960 navigation as search screen to find any
00:01:25.680 movie in seconds and a full movie
00:01:28.200 Details page where you can get all the
00:01:30.360 info you need and more but this course
00:01:33.439 isn't just about building an app it's
00:01:35.399 about building it the right way by
00:01:37.600 writing clean scalable and maintainable
00:01:40.920 code and to make your journey even
00:01:42.799 easier I've put together a free react
00:01:45.200 native roadmap that covers the essential
00:01:47.320 tools you need to know the projects you
00:01:49.200 should build and the exact path to
00:01:51.520 getting hired as a react native
00:01:53.200 developer you can download it now it's
00:01:55.240 completely free and the link is in the
00:01:56.920 description so by the time you finish
00:01:59.119 this course you won't just know react
00:02:01.840 native you'll be shipping relaps with
00:02:03.799 confidence so let's build something
00:02:11.879 great before react native building
00:02:15.000 mobile applications for multiple
00:02:17.040 platforms was a nightmare you had to
00:02:20.160 write separate code bases for IOS and
00:02:22.840 Android which meant double the work
00:02:25.360 higher costs and slower development
00:02:27.879 Cycles but with react native you can
00:02:30.920 write a single code base that works
00:02:33.200 seamlessly on both platforms making
00:02:35.720 development faster cheaper and more
00:02:38.200 efficient and it's not just me saying
00:02:40.680 this big companies like meta Discord
00:02:44.159 Microsoft Tesla Amazon Airbnb and even
00:02:47.760 Call of Duty use react native to build
00:02:50.480 their mobile apps react native has
00:02:52.879 evolved so much that you'll find fewer
00:02:55.400 people flattering these days and with
00:02:57.760 the release of react's new architecture
00:03:00.280 performance has been improved
00:03:02.400 significantly so the next time someone
00:03:04.959 says Hey react native apps are slow just
00:03:08.599 take a deep breath and say not anymore
00:03:11.799 flut boy let me break it down first
00:03:14.560 there's the new JSI JavaScript interface
00:03:17.840 which replaces the old bridge allowing
00:03:20.560 JavaScript to communicate directly with
00:03:22.840 the native code for a faster and
00:03:25.080 smoother performance then there are the
00:03:27.640 new turbo modules that load native
00:03:30.159 modules only when needed reducing
00:03:32.519 startup time and memory usage and third
00:03:35.799 there's a new thing called fabric which
00:03:38.280 optimizes UI rendering making animations
00:03:41.519 gestures and updates faster and more
00:03:44.480 efficient with JSI turbo modules and
00:03:47.879 fabric react native apps are now as fast
00:03:51.120 and smooth as the native ones and aside
00:03:53.920 from its new architecture crossplatform
00:03:56.000 support and Native components react
00:03:58.680 native also comes with hard reloading
00:04:01.200 allowing you to see the changes you code
00:04:03.079 instantly a huge community that just
00:04:05.480 keeps on growing and an easy learning
00:04:08.159 curve which means that if you already
00:04:10.000 know JavaScript and react you can
00:04:12.040 quickly pick up react native and that's
00:04:14.439 exactly what we'll do today in this
00:04:17.238 video we'll use Expo to build a react
00:04:20.199 native application and before you say
00:04:22.720 wait real developers don't use Expo hold
00:04:26.120 on if you check react natives official
00:04:28.759 documentation Expo is the recommended
00:04:31.360 way to get started read that again but
00:04:35.000 what the heck even is Expo you're
00:04:37.039 familiar with tools like vit right well
00:04:39.880 Expo is just that only for react native
00:04:42.639 apps it provides many tools and services
00:04:45.759 that simplify development and help you
00:04:48.000 build your app more easily Expo is the
00:04:50.960 react native what nextjs is the react
00:04:54.600 it's a framework that simplifies react
00:04:56.759 native development by handling the
00:04:58.919 development enir setup which means that
00:05:01.120 you don't need to separately install
00:05:02.840 Android Studio native dependencies and
00:05:05.479 pre-built components for navigation
00:05:07.919 gestures camera maps and more it also
00:05:10.680 supports something known as overthe a
00:05:12.800 updates so your app users can get the
00:05:15.400 latest code without needing App Store
00:05:18.120 approvals and this is huge with Expo you
00:05:21.560 can deploy your app in minutes but don't
00:05:24.319 just take my word for it companies like
00:05:26.639 Discord Burger King coinbase X box and
00:05:30.479 more than 2,000 companies are using Expo
00:05:32.800 for their tools and Expo just like njs
00:05:36.800 just keeps on getting better so if you
00:05:39.199 still think react native CLI is the
00:05:41.039 better option well think twice so now
00:05:43.520 that you understand the importance of
00:05:45.120 react native and apparently how easy it
00:05:47.720 is to build apps with it let me show you
00:05:50.240 I'll first teach you some basic react
00:05:52.160 native Concepts and then very quickly
00:05:54.600 into this video you'll build a real
00:05:57.360 mobile movie application so let's Dive
00:06:00.400 Right In all right let's Jump Right In
00:06:03.560 we've already talked about the benefits
00:06:05.280 and drawbacks of react native and how
00:06:07.720 Expo can make your life easier now it's
00:06:10.400 time to dive into the code and see how
00:06:12.280 it works if you worked with react GS
00:06:15.680 before you'll find that react native
00:06:17.680 uses a similar syntax but of course
00:06:20.599 there are some differences you should be
00:06:22.280 aware of so let me show you the ins and
00:06:24.880 outs of react native code we can check
00:06:26.880 out how it looks and how it functions
00:06:28.880 when compared to to react GS to help you
00:06:31.599 understand the similarities but also the
00:06:33.840 differences between the two so super
00:06:35.880 quickly you'll understand the react
00:06:37.720 native's components and how to use them
00:06:39.919 when coding in react native you use
00:06:42.400 JavaScript just like with react but
00:06:45.599 instead of rendering HTML elements
00:06:48.000 you'll be rendering native mobile
00:06:50.919 components take a look at this basic
00:06:53.199 react native component here we're
00:06:55.720 importing two important components from
00:06:58.000 react native Library View and text then
00:07:01.639 we create a functional component called
00:07:03.520 app that Returns the text component
00:07:05.800 wrapped inside of a view what's
00:07:07.560 interesting here is that we're using jsx
00:07:09.840 syntax which makes it super easy to
00:07:12.280 create and visualize our components in a
00:07:14.759 more HTML like way but if you take a
00:07:17.479 closer look you can quickly see that
00:07:19.319 this is neither a P tag nor an H tag nor
00:07:22.960 anything that we're used to while
00:07:24.400 writing code that runs in the browser in
00:07:27.199 react native we use text instead said
00:07:30.520 it's pretty straightforward the text
00:07:32.160 component is used to display text in the
00:07:34.599 app and you can style it using the same
00:07:36.759 CSS like syntax as in react you can set
00:07:39.599 the font size color and weight using the
00:07:42.160 style prop react native also offers a
00:07:45.039 Styles sheet utility that allows you to
00:07:47.560 Define styles by creating a single
00:07:49.720 JavaScript object this is super handy in
00:07:52.120 larger applications as it optimizes
00:07:54.319 performance but as we all know tailin
00:07:56.800 CSS is rising in popularity so so in
00:08:00.000 react native World native wind came into
00:08:02.440 the picture allowing you to write
00:08:04.400 Tailwind likee CSS Styles in react
00:08:06.759 native isn't this crazy it feels like
00:08:09.080 you're writing a regular web app but
00:08:11.479 instead you're developing apps for
00:08:13.240 mobile now let's talk a bit about the
00:08:15.479 view component think of it as a box or
00:08:18.520 container that holds other components
00:08:21.360 similar to the development in HTML but
00:08:24.039 with some added functionality specific
00:08:25.759 to mobile apps The View component is
00:08:28.280 often used to create layout structures
00:08:31.000 for other
00:08:32.240 components it has many different props
00:08:34.799 that can be used to control its
00:08:36.279 appearance and
00:08:37.719 behavior and one thing to note is that
00:08:40.159 the view component uses flexbox layout
00:08:43.000 by default which makes it really easy to
00:08:45.839 control how its children components are
00:08:47.839 laid out so you can use flexbox
00:08:50.440 properties like Flex Direction justify
00:08:53.040 content and align items to achieve any
00:08:55.800 layout you want but what if you want to
00:08:57.839 add some interactivity to your re act
00:08:59.680 native apps well get excited because
00:09:02.160 there are some amazing components that
00:09:04.160 do just that components for creating
00:09:06.320 buttons links and other interactive
00:09:08.959 elements the first one on the list is
00:09:11.760 touchable opacity which is great if you
00:09:13.920 want to create a simple button think of
00:09:15.800 it like a cousin to a react button
00:09:18.120 component but with even more room for
00:09:20.680 customization and instead of an onclick
00:09:22.920 in react native you're not clicking it
00:09:25.160 you're pressing it so let's provide an
00:09:27.440 on press the second similar component is
00:09:30.320 called a touchable highlight which
00:09:32.760 allows views to respond to touch in a
00:09:35.680 unique way when touched the component
00:09:38.640 reduces the opacity of the wrapped div
00:09:41.279 revealing the underlying color and then
00:09:43.680 there's the touchable without feedback
00:09:45.839 which is there if you need to create an
00:09:47.279 element that is clickable but you don't
00:09:50.040 want it to have any visual feedback when
00:09:52.240 pressed it is super useful when creating
00:09:55.079 links or images that don't need any
00:09:57.360 additional effects and apart from these
00:09:59.640 touchable components there's also
00:10:01.600 activity indicator which allows you to
00:10:03.839 show a spinner or a loading indicator
00:10:06.600 within your app sure there's also a
00:10:08.519 simple button allowing you to set
00:10:10.360 properties like the title color and an
00:10:12.880 on press that is called when the button
00:10:14.920 is pressed but whenever you need some
00:10:16.720 more Advanced Styling or behavior you'll
00:10:19.399 find yourself using the touchable
00:10:21.040 components much more often as they offer
00:10:23.560 greater flexibility now the next super
00:10:26.480 important component on the list of
00:10:28.399 components I want toach teacher right
00:10:29.880 now and which we'll use later on within
00:10:32.079 our app is called a
00:10:34.560 flatlist a flatlist is perfect for
00:10:37.760 rendering long lists of items that need
00:10:40.839 to be scrolled it's like the map
00:10:43.160 function in react but with some extra
00:10:45.480 features like optimized scroll
00:10:47.519 performance and item separation the way
00:10:50.079 it works is you of course import it from
00:10:52.360 react native and then you define some
00:10:54.800 data such as an array of objects you
00:10:56.760 want to map over then you put it all in
00:10:59.600 a view and you call it flatlist a
00:11:03.200 flatlist by default already accepts some
00:11:05.880 props such as the data prop to which you
00:11:08.240 can pass an array of data you want to
00:11:10.079 map over and then a render item prop
00:11:13.079 which allows you to Define exactly how
00:11:15.839 you want to represent each item in the
00:11:18.200 array pretty cool right now when should
00:11:21.079 you use a flat list and when should you
00:11:23.560 just map over the
00:11:25.079 elements well for larger lists where you
00:11:27.959 want to have smooth scrolling
00:11:29.839 go for the flat list while for the
00:11:32.040 smaller lists the map function will do
00:11:34.120 the job there's also something known as
00:11:35.880 a scroll view you can think of it like a
00:11:38.680 magic box that can hold multiple
00:11:40.760 components and Views providing you a
00:11:42.800 scrolling container for them it's like
00:11:45.160 the Overflow scroll property of a div in
00:11:47.600 HTML allowing you to easily navigate
00:11:50.560 through a list of items or large amounts
00:11:52.920 of content in our app you can put it
00:11:54.600 within a view call it scroll View and
00:11:56.839 then render some elements within it by
00:11:58.600 using the scroll view component you can
00:12:00.600 make sure that users can easily explore
00:12:02.720 all the content making your app more
00:12:04.959 intuitive and there's also a component
00:12:06.880 which you'll find yourself using super
00:12:08.839 often called safe area view which gives
00:12:12.160 you some sort of a safe Zone to render
00:12:14.519 your apps content within without it
00:12:16.800 being covered by the devices Hardware
00:12:18.959 features like the notch home indicator
00:12:21.800 or a status bar it's great for building
00:12:23.959 apps that are supported on different
00:12:25.720 devices with different screen sizes and
00:12:28.160 shapes the way you use it is whenever
00:12:30.959 you think something might be too long or
00:12:32.959 awkwardly placed you just wrap it within
00:12:34.920 a safe area View and while that default
00:12:37.279 safe area view is amazing for most cases
00:12:40.440 sometimes it does fall short for some
00:12:42.320 devices making it not the optimal choice
00:12:45.360 so I often like to use a package called
00:12:47.920 react native safe area context which
00:12:50.560 works across all devices even for the
00:12:53.199 Bottom bar but you don't have to worry
00:12:55.040 about remembering all of that right now
00:12:56.839 I'll show it to you once you start
00:12:58.480 developing your own first app but bear
00:13:01.360 with me for a moment I first want you to
00:13:03.399 know which components exist so we can
00:13:05.839 later on use them more easily for
00:13:07.839 example we'll surely have to display
00:13:09.800 some images within our app right so how
00:13:12.120 can we do that in react native well
00:13:14.519 thankfully once again it is super
00:13:16.519 similar to how it looks like in react
00:13:18.760 you just use the image component
00:13:20.199 provided by react native you pass the
00:13:22.360 source to it which can be a path or a
00:13:24.480 URL and you're good but if you want to
00:13:27.079 display an image as a background then
00:13:29.760 you should use the image background
00:13:31.600 component which works in the same way
00:13:33.839 but just renders it as a background it's
00:13:36.240 specifically designed to allow other
00:13:38.560 components to be layered on top of it
00:13:41.040 whereas just the image is used for
00:13:43.279 displaying images on their own and both
00:13:45.519 of these can handle different image
00:13:47.000 formats like pngs jpegs gifs and web PS
00:13:50.839 but nons support SVG files because of
00:13:53.920 some native rendering limitations so if
00:13:56.320 you want to use svgs there's a
00:13:58.240 thirdparty package called react native
00:14:00.240 SVG once again don't try to remember it
00:14:03.079 I'll show it to you once again later on
00:14:04.959 so you can use it within your own code
00:14:07.399 okay now that you know how to use images
00:14:09.680 what about models well thankfully react
00:14:12.199 native has components for that too it's
00:14:14.399 called a model just import it from react
00:14:17.040 native set visible to True add an
00:14:19.839 animation type and Define what happens
00:14:22.399 when you close it pretty simple there's
00:14:24.759 also an alert component which you can
00:14:26.839 again just very conveniently report from
00:14:29.519 react native and call it by saying
00:14:32.120 alert. alert provide a title and
00:14:35.199 functions which you want to execute on
00:14:37.199 cancel or on okay and if you're creating
00:14:39.920 forms you might want to create some kind
00:14:41.720 of a toggle in react native and for that
00:14:44.440 you can use a switch component once
00:14:46.880 again it is super simple imported create
00:14:50.079 a state for it same as in
00:14:52.519 react create a function that manages it
00:14:55.440 and then simply call it like this within
00:14:56.959 your code provide some colors its value
00:15:00.240 and what happens when you click it
00:15:02.079 there's also a component that I use
00:15:03.880 super often called the status bar both
00:15:06.720 react native and Expo have their own
00:15:09.160 versions that allow you to control how
00:15:11.040 status bar should look like for each
00:15:12.920 screen within the app I prefer using the
00:15:15.279 one from Expo you can define a view with
00:15:17.560 some text and just beneath it you can
00:15:19.959 define a status bar but what am I even
00:15:22.440 trying to do I'm just listing all of the
00:15:24.680 different components that you can use to
00:15:26.759 build your mobile applications well I I
00:15:29.120 guess I'm just trying to show you that
00:15:31.160 there are some differences like P tags
00:15:33.639 and H tags are now becoming text divs
00:15:36.600 are becoming views but other than that
00:15:39.199 there are so many components that feel
00:15:42.120 like you're writing react code within
00:15:44.399 react native allowing you to build
00:15:46.959 mobile applications from touchable
00:15:49.160 opacities for buttons to models alerts
00:15:52.360 and more the list doesn't stop there of
00:15:55.360 course I don't want to waste your time
00:15:57.240 we're not going to go through every
00:15:58.600 single component that exists in this
00:16:00.680 video but I did take some time and I
00:16:03.120 wrote down the most important ones
00:16:05.319 within the free react native guide
00:16:07.120 Linked In the description so if you want
00:16:08.920 to check them out there see the
00:16:10.399 differences and similarities and just
00:16:12.279 have a place where you can recap what
00:16:13.839 you learned that guide is what you need
00:16:16.040 but now that you know the most important
00:16:17.839 components and Concepts in react native
00:16:20.240 let's Dive Right into action I'll show
00:16:22.160 you how to set up your app what files
00:16:24.120 and folders are involved and everything
00:16:26.360 else that matters step by step
00:16:35.040 step all right before we dive into the
00:16:37.839 development of the movies app let me
00:16:39.680 quickly tell you what you'll build and
00:16:41.639 learn along the way you'll get the
00:16:43.680 firsthand opportunity to put into code
00:16:46.319 many components I was just telling you
00:16:48.040 about a couple of minutes ago core react
00:16:50.279 native components like view touchable
00:16:52.560 opacity image flat list scroll view safe
00:16:55.720 area view text input and more different
00:16:58.399 Navigation like stack navigation tab
00:17:01.120 navigation with custom styling and
00:17:03.560 advanced file based routing including
00:17:06.000 nested and dynamic routes custom Hooks
00:17:09.439 and fonts to make your app more flexible
00:17:11.599 and reusable types and interfaces with
00:17:14.480 typescript for better type safety
00:17:16.799 responsive design to ensure the app
00:17:18.919 looks great on any screen of course
00:17:21.640 Tailwind CSS for clean and scalable
00:17:24.240 design backend with aite to handle data
00:17:27.599 and user interactions and many other
00:17:30.120 best practices we'll go step by step and
00:17:33.280 I'll teach you to implement amazing
00:17:35.120 stuff which you'll see yourself using
00:17:37.120 across any future apps you build like a
00:17:39.799 search feature with optimized
00:17:41.480 performance fetching movies data from a
00:17:43.880 thirdparty API smooth loading and air
00:17:47.280 handling and then a trending movies
00:17:49.919 algorithm that tracks user searches and
00:17:52.559 helps us recommend the most popular
00:17:54.720 movies based on real user activity
00:17:57.600 pretty cool right will use aight to
00:17:59.880 store that user activity for this
00:18:01.600 algorithm to work so let's quickly
00:18:03.760 create an account click the link down in
00:18:05.960 the description to be able to follow
00:18:07.720 along and see exactly what I'm seeing
00:18:10.000 create your account at the top right or
00:18:12.240 just sign in as you can see I'm using
00:18:14.679 app right for many of my projects and
00:18:17.320 now you can just create a new one for
00:18:18.919 this one I'll call it
00:18:20.919 JSM RN movie app you can do something
00:18:25.039 similar and you can choose the region
00:18:27.400 and click create now with can set up our
00:18:29.320 project's file and folder structure and
00:18:31.559 very soon we'll put this project to
00:18:34.840 use let's get started with developing
00:18:37.400 our app by first setting up our
00:18:39.360 development environment I've created a
00:18:41.360 new empty folder on my desktop called it
00:18:43.960 mobile movie app and opened it up within
00:18:46.679 my IDE throughout this course I'll be
00:18:48.880 using webstorm the most powerful
00:18:51.320 JavaScript and typescript IDE until
00:18:53.520 recently it was paid so not everyone was
00:18:55.880 able to use it but as of now it is
00:18:58.799 completely free for noncommercial use
00:19:01.200 I'll leave the link in the description
00:19:02.799 you can check it out and download it for
00:19:04.640 your operating system once you install
00:19:06.600 it you can set it up to look exactly how
00:19:08.480 you want it to look currently I'm using
00:19:10.480 the material deep ocean theme and lately
00:19:13.080 I prefer using it over vs code so once
00:19:15.640 you create an empty folder in whichever
00:19:17.520 editor you're using we can create our
00:19:19.400 new react native application if you head
00:19:21.720 over to react native. deev click get
00:19:24.799 started you'll notice that there are a
00:19:26.640 couple of different ways in which you
00:19:28.080 can initialize your react native
00:19:29.799 projects and as I've mentioned in the
00:19:31.440 crash course the recommended way of
00:19:33.200 course is Expo it'll provide us with a
00:19:35.480 lot of important features out of the box
00:19:37.440 making our development experience that
00:19:39.440 much better so to start your react
00:19:41.880 native app with Expo the only thing you
00:19:43.840 have to do is run this command in your
00:19:46.120 terminal so let's write it together by
00:19:48.799 opening up the terminal and running MPX
00:19:52.039 create D xo- app add latest and then add
00:19:56.919 slash to install it in the current
00:19:58.679 directory now it'll proceed to install
00:20:00.880 all the necessary packages that we need
00:20:02.760 to run a react native application and
00:20:04.679 you can see that it's also starting to
00:20:06.000 create our file and folder structure
00:20:08.600 very soon I'll explain exactly what all
00:20:10.679 of these files and folders mean and what
00:20:12.679 they do once it gets installed you'll be
00:20:14.880 able to run it now going back to the
00:20:16.919 docs it says Hey run this command and
00:20:19.559 then continue with Expo and when you
00:20:21.400 click it it'll show you how you can set
00:20:23.200 up your development environment no
00:20:24.840 matter which device you're using in this
00:20:26.720 case I'll be using a real iOS device but
00:20:29.400 you can also use an Android then it's
00:20:31.440 asking you how you would like to develop
00:20:33.400 and we'll be using Expo go so depending
00:20:35.480 on your operating system you'll be able
00:20:37.120 to scan the QR code to download it or
00:20:39.480 visit the expoo page on the App Store
00:20:41.799 once you install it you'll be able to
00:20:43.400 create your account and your screen
00:20:45.039 should look something like this so the
00:20:47.240 first thing we have to do is start a
00:20:49.240 development server by running MPX Expo
00:20:52.039 start so back within our terminal let's
00:20:54.240 do just that run MPX expose start and
00:20:57.640 you'll be able to see different letters
00:20:59.159 that allow you to do different things
00:21:01.039 but you don't have to press any of them
00:21:02.880 what you have to do is just scan this QR
00:21:05.600 code so I'll open up my camera and scan
00:21:08.440 it right here it'll say bundling and in
00:21:11.480 a couple of seconds the app will run on
00:21:13.840 your phone there we go we are live as I
00:21:17.720 mentioned we don't need to rely on heavy
00:21:20.080 tools like Android Studio or xcode
00:21:22.679 instead we're using this easiest method
00:21:24.720 to develop apps with react native which
00:21:27.000 of course includes this Expo app on your
00:21:29.000 phone and as you can see I can switch
00:21:30.840 between different pages touch different
00:21:32.520 elements on the screen and it feels like
00:21:34.520 I'm using a real mobile application now
00:21:37.279 if you're not seeing what I'm seeing on
00:21:38.760 the screen then that must mean that
00:21:40.520 you're having some problems and
00:21:42.080 thankfully there is a couple of quick
00:21:43.720 fixes first make sure that you're on the
00:21:46.279 same Wi-Fi network on your computer and
00:21:48.679 your device and if it still doesn't work
00:21:51.400 it may be due to the router
00:21:52.640 configuration common for public networks
00:21:55.200 on iOS you might have to Grant the local
00:21:57.799 network permission to the Expo Go app or
00:22:00.200 you can try using this MPX Expo start--
00:22:03.200 tunnel or just read whatever the Expo
00:22:05.240 app is saying and try resolving it step
00:22:07.520 by step but with that in mind we are now
00:22:09.640 ready to make our first change to do
00:22:11.679 that we can head over within our app
00:22:14.120 tabs index. TSX and if you see this
00:22:17.559 welcome theme text you can say something
00:22:20.400 like
00:22:21.640 welcome to my movie app because that's
00:22:25.080 exactly what we're building if you save
00:22:27.279 it you can see that it'll change
00:22:29.200 immediately and we can remove this wave
00:22:31.360 so this means that we have established a
00:22:33.039 connection between our code and our
00:22:35.440 device so we can see all the changes
00:22:37.279 live now that our project is running let
00:22:39.600 me quickly explain what each one of the
00:22:41.440 files and folders here does so you have
00:22:43.520 a better understanding of the entire
00:22:44.960 codebase so you can more confidently
00:22:47.000 make changes to your application later
00:22:48.559 on let's start from the bottom to the
00:22:50.320 top first we have the TS config which
00:22:53.360 contains the rules that typescript will
00:22:55.240 use to enforce type safety throughout
00:22:57.200 the project and no worries you don't
00:22:59.360 need to know typescript to be able to
00:23:00.919 proceed with this course I'll teach it
00:23:02.640 to you as we go next we have the read me
00:23:05.919 which is a text file containing some
00:23:07.440 information about the project then
00:23:09.440 there's the package lock and
00:23:11.400 package.json which contains the project
00:23:13.960 scripts dependencies and additional
00:23:16.840 metadata after that there's the app.
00:23:19.720 Json file which contains the
00:23:21.559 configuration options for the project
00:23:23.600 and is often called the app config these
00:23:26.919 options change the behavior of your
00:23:29.200 project while developing building
00:23:31.559 submitting or updating your app
00:23:33.520 everything starts with an expo object
00:23:35.960 which is the root object containing all
00:23:37.919 the app configuration then of course
00:23:39.919 there's the app name shown on the home
00:23:42.120 screen or the app screen very important
00:23:44.600 in case you want to make it custom then
00:23:46.880 there's the slug which is a unique
00:23:48.679 identifier for the project used by Expo
00:23:51.440 it's used when defining the URL if you
00:23:53.440 want to show your project in the web
00:23:55.559 there's the version of the project the
00:23:57.960 orientation ation which defines whether
00:24:00.000 your app should initially open in
00:24:01.799 portrait landscape or the default screen
00:24:04.559 orientation mode the icon is the full
00:24:06.880 path to the image you want to display
00:24:09.279 the scheme is a custom URL to enable
00:24:11.799 deep linking in this case let's set it
00:24:14.480 to movies so later on we can do
00:24:17.360 something like movies Colin sl/ some
00:24:21.520 path there's also the user interface
00:24:23.720 style which we can leave to automatic
00:24:26.320 this determines the dark or light mode
00:24:28.760 and then there's this new Arch enabled
00:24:31.279 which enables the new architecture of
00:24:33.200 react native for better performance it
00:24:35.399 was that thing that I talked to you
00:24:36.760 about in the crash course part regarding
00:24:38.760 JSI turbo modules and more and what's
00:24:41.880 best is that Expo immediately supports
00:24:44.360 this new architecture without you having
00:24:46.360 to do anything along with this you're
00:24:49.120 also getting the newest react features
00:24:51.200 like transitions moving on we have IOS
00:24:54.360 specific features that you can extend
00:24:56.480 specifically on iOS devices in this case
00:24:58.960 you can define whether it supports
00:25:00.399 tablet devices and then there are also
00:25:03.000 Android specific properties such as apps
00:25:06.080 adaptive icon path to the image color
00:25:09.240 and more and similarly there's also
00:25:11.679 additional options for the web now
00:25:13.600 coming out of the app. Json there's of
00:25:15.919 course the git ignore which allows us to
00:25:18.080 ignore some environment variables or git
00:25:20.600 related things there's the scripts
00:25:22.679 folder currently having just one part
00:25:25.279 which allows us to reset the project to
00:25:27.000 the bare minimum code and and then
00:25:28.600 there's some boilerplate code like
00:25:30.640 custom hooks constants some components
00:25:35.080 assets and finally the app folder which
00:25:38.240 allows us to route to different pages
00:25:40.559 similarly to
00:25:42.000 nextjs or in this case we're not calling
00:25:44.520 them Pages we're calling them screens
00:25:47.080 you can see this tabs group in which we
00:25:49.279 have more files within here you'll be
00:25:51.360 able to manage the layouts for different
00:25:53.080 pages and very soon I'll show you
00:25:55.200 exactly how it works there is a lot of
00:25:57.919 code but you don't have to memorize all
00:26:00.240 of this boilerplate code because I'll
00:26:02.520 teach you how everything works from
00:26:04.360 scratch so let's use this nice script
00:26:07.159 that Expo has given to us called reset
00:26:09.640 project which will set the project to
00:26:11.679 its bare minimum I'll stop the
00:26:13.360 application from running and then I will
00:26:15.279 run mpm run reset Das project it's going
00:26:19.480 to ask you whether you want to move
00:26:21.000 everything to the example folder I'll
00:26:23.640 say no just go ahead and delete it so as
00:26:26.200 you can see all of these folders have
00:26:27.840 been deleted deled and some new files
00:26:30.440 very Bare Bones have been created we can
00:26:32.960 once again run MPX expose start to start
00:26:36.600 the development
00:26:37.720 server and then you can just press the
00:26:39.840 letter R to reload it automatically on
00:26:42.559 your device now if you check it out
00:26:44.720 it'll look much simpler the app only
00:26:46.919 consists of a very simple layout and an
00:26:49.760 even simpler index. TSX page where we
00:26:52.919 can say welcome and we can dive right
00:26:56.000 into extending it to build our MO movie
00:26:58.520 application great job on completing the
00:27:02.559 setup we're done with the general setup
00:27:05.120 of the application but there are still
00:27:07.440 some things we got to set up such as
00:27:09.640 additional packages for styling and
00:27:12.000 configuration that will make our job
00:27:13.880 easier later on one of those packages is
00:27:16.840 called native wind native wind doesn't
00:27:19.360 even have its own landing page it just
00:27:21.520 says do you like using Tailwind CSS to
00:27:23.720 style your apps well this helps you do
00:27:26.399 that in react native so we use it for
00:27:28.760 that exact reason you can install it by
00:27:31.120 opening up a new terminal keep this one
00:27:33.559 running because it's the one running our
00:27:35.279 app and run mpm
00:27:37.840 install native wind Tailwind CSS react
00:27:43.480 native reanimated and react native safe
00:27:48.440 area context these are some packages
00:27:51.120 that are going to make our styling
00:27:52.240 easier let's give them a few moments
00:27:53.919 until they install and once that is done
00:27:56.640 run MPX Tailwind CSS init this will
00:28:01.080 generate our configuration file you can
00:28:03.559 find it within your code right here
00:28:05.600 Tailwind Doc config.js and you'll get a
00:28:08.519 default configuration but to make sure
00:28:10.840 it works properly with a react native
00:28:12.640 setup we'll need to update it a bit here
00:28:15.159 you want to include all the files that
00:28:17.120 you want ta into to style so in this
00:28:19.000 case everything within the app folder
00:28:21.200 that ends with JS jsx or TS or TSX and
00:28:25.120 we're also adding a babble preset so
00:28:27.760 just copy it from native winds Expo
00:28:29.880 setup and just override what you had in
00:28:31.919 the tailin config file finally create a
00:28:34.080 new file within the app folder and call
00:28:36.960 it global. CSS and within it you'll have
00:28:40.840 to import three things or rather add
00:28:44.399 three Tailwind directives Tailwind base
00:28:47.159 Tailwind components and Tailwind
00:28:49.399 utilities after that we'll have to set
00:28:51.600 up the Babel preset so copy this config
00:28:54.880 and create a new file in the root of
00:28:56.720 your directory called
00:28:59.120 Babel Doc config.js and paste what you
00:29:03.760 just copied after that we'll also have
00:29:06.519 to modify our Metro config so just copy
00:29:09.360 it open up your terminal and run MPX
00:29:13.480 Expo customize metro. config.js
00:29:18.799 this will generate that config file so
00:29:22.159 you'll be able to find it right here and
00:29:24.200 you can override it with what we just
00:29:25.840 copied from native wind get default
00:29:28.760 config with Native wind we wrap that
00:29:31.320 configuration and we set it up you don't
00:29:33.760 have to worry about understanding what's
00:29:35.360 happening here this is just the setup to
00:29:37.279 make the styling work finally we can
00:29:39.519 head over into our appor layout. DSX and
00:29:44.240 right here we can import the/ global.
00:29:48.039 CSS so we can actually apply some of
00:29:50.279 these Styles and then at the root of
00:29:52.559 your project create a new file called
00:29:55.880 native wind- EnV .
00:29:59.360 D.S and within it add a triple for slash
00:30:03.159 open up a new self-closing component
00:30:05.320 called reference and add types equal to
00:30:08.519 Native wind types this will enable tab
00:30:11.080 script to recognize tailin CSS classes
00:30:13.679 preventing constant error messages and
00:30:16.440 very quickly head over into your Metro
00:30:18.640 config and make sure that the input
00:30:21.279 points to the right path to our global.
00:30:23.840 CSS file so it is not/ global. CSS
00:30:28.919 rather it
00:30:30.640 isapp SL globals with an s. CSS this has
00:30:36.399 to match this global. CSS file once you
00:30:39.840 do it close all of your files and open
00:30:42.519 up your terminal to make sure that
00:30:44.679 everything we've done right now actually
00:30:46.559 works you'll have to restart your
00:30:48.399 application by pressing contrl
00:30:50.480 C and this can get boring pretty soon
00:30:53.320 but whenever something is not working or
00:30:55.240 your changes are not being reflected
00:30:57.159 just go ahead and set it it'll help so
00:30:59.679 start your app with a command MPX Expos
00:31:03.360 start-- clear this will make sure that
00:31:05.919 everything we've done actually gets
00:31:07.480 taken into account and then press R to
00:31:09.919 reload your application it'll first
00:31:11.760 bundle it and then depending on your
00:31:13.600 internet speed it'll download the code
00:31:15.760 and it'll display it right here on the
00:31:17.440 screen so while that is happening let me
00:31:20.240 head over into the index. DSX file and
00:31:23.240 now hopefully we can style our
00:31:25.159 applications using Tailwind instead of
00:31:27.440 these default Styles let's remove these
00:31:30.120 default inline Styles and instead let's
00:31:33.399 give it a class name and say something
00:31:36.320 like Flex
00:31:37.840 D1 justify Das Center and items - Center
00:31:42.440 which should keep it centered like it
00:31:44.440 did before and we can also style this
00:31:46.880 welcome by giving it a class name of
00:31:50.159 text- 5xl and by the way notice how my
00:31:53.799 webstorm IDE is giving me all of these
00:31:56.440 options in a super nice way so I
00:31:58.880 immediately know exactly which Styles
00:32:01.880 will each one of these tailin CSS
00:32:03.760 properties apply we can also give it a
00:32:05.679 text blue of 500 as well as font Das
00:32:09.360 bolt if you save it in a matter of
00:32:11.880 seconds you'll be able to see the
00:32:13.320 changes reflected on your device now
00:32:16.120 instead of saying something like text
00:32:18.240 Dash and then manually defining the
00:32:20.360 color like hash2 3 1 2 3 this is not
00:32:24.159 going to work right whenever you change
00:32:25.880 one color you have to change it across
00:32:28.200 hundreds of different files so what you
00:32:30.880 typically do when using Tailwind is
00:32:33.120 Define custom themes within your
00:32:35.080 configuration file so head over into
00:32:37.720 Tailwind Doc config.js and extend your
00:32:42.039 theme with some additional colors such
00:32:45.120 as a primary color of something like #
00:32:51.600 0314 now going back to your app you can
00:32:54.639 just say text- primary and and it'll
00:32:58.360 automatically take that color into
00:33:00.320 account pretty cool right so where did I
00:33:03.480 find this color well just below you'll
00:33:06.279 be able to find a link to a complete
00:33:08.440 figma design of this project you can go
00:33:10.720 through it a bit and if you go ahead and
00:33:12.880 click a couple of times on different
00:33:15.440 elements it'll tell you what is the
00:33:17.799 color of that specific element so for
00:33:20.240 example we have this accent color of AB8
00:33:24.080 BFF so we can copy it and back in the
00:33:27.120 code we can add that accent color just
00:33:30.000 like this and then you can use it very
00:33:32.760 easily within your code by saying text
00:33:35.480 Dash accent there are also a couple of
00:33:38.000 other colors from this design that I
00:33:40.159 want to add maybe the dark background
00:33:42.600 color or this gray color right here that
00:33:44.720 we want to use you can find them on the
00:33:47.080 design yourself and then copy them
00:33:48.799 within your app such as this variant of
00:33:50.639 the dark color or we can do it together
00:33:53.080 right now there aren't too many
00:33:54.960 alongside the primary color we'll also
00:33:57.000 have the secondary
00:33:58.519 which is going to be hh1 151
00:34:01.840 312 we'll also have a couple of
00:34:04.519 variations of the light color such as
00:34:07.279 the 100 variation of hash
00:34:11.040 d6c 7 FF we can also have a 200 variant
00:34:15.199 of hash A8 B5 DB as well as 300 which is
00:34:21.000 going to be set to Hash 9 C A4 a and we
00:34:26.480 can have a couple of variations of the
00:34:28.199 dark color one for the bottom navigation
00:34:31.040 bar and one for the background so I'll
00:34:33.239 say 100 # 221
00:34:37.440 f3d as well as 200 variation of # 0 F0
00:34:43.079 d23 if you save it all of these
00:34:45.679 variations of different colors will be
00:34:47.760 extended in our theme so now we can very
00:34:50.399 easily use them by saying text- dark
00:34:53.480 D200 for example and with that we have
00:34:56.280 just set up native one inside of your
00:34:58.520 project allowing us to style our
00:35:00.320 applications more easily you'll
00:35:02.040 definitely want to save this entire
00:35:03.560 process somewhere as this is something
00:35:05.119 you'll have to do with every single app
00:35:07.359 and as you saw it's not easy as ABCs if
00:35:10.440 you mess one thing the Styles will not
00:35:12.599 be getting applied so I'll include the
00:35:15.119 entire native one setup within that
00:35:17.240 react native guide down below so you can
00:35:19.920 always refer back to it even when you're
00:35:21.880 building your own applications in the
00:35:23.560 future great job on setting up the
00:35:25.440 styling next routing oh and I almost
00:35:28.960 forgot to mention something that is
00:35:30.440 super relevant here if you're struggling
00:35:32.560 with tawin CSS and you think that would
00:35:35.119 hinder your work on the react native app
00:35:37.599 just recently I have published the
00:35:39.400 updated version of the Tailwind CSS
00:35:41.800 crash course which teaches you
00:35:43.680 everything you need to know about
00:35:44.599 Tailwind in less than an hour so if you
00:35:46.960 want to revisit your Tailwind styling
00:35:48.680 game before we proceed with the rest of
00:35:50.319 the course checking it out might be a
00:35:52.520 good idea
00:35:58.240 it's time to do the routing and as I
00:36:00.920 mentioned before routing in react native
00:36:03.720 Works similarly to routing in nextjs but
00:36:07.240 even if you haven't tried it in xjs
00:36:09.079 don't worry because I'll show you
00:36:10.520 exactly what that means it simply means
00:36:12.680 that your file within the app folder
00:36:15.400 represents your route and the file name
00:36:18.079 is a URL pointing to that route for
00:36:21.119 example the app. index DSX represents
00:36:24.359 Your Home Route the starting point of
00:36:26.720 your app and and if you want to create
00:36:28.520 another route like let's say you want to
00:36:30.400 onboard users to your app you can create
00:36:32.960 a new file and let's call it onboarding
00:36:35.839 ttsx and within it you can run RN FES
00:36:40.520 which is a simple react native
00:36:42.240 functional export with component Styles
00:36:45.160 so just a quick boiler plate so we don't
00:36:47.040 have to write it by hand if this didn't
00:36:49.560 work for you that must mean that you
00:36:51.240 don't have the react and react native
00:36:53.240 extension for plugins installed so just
00:36:56.079 search for your plugins and search for
00:36:58.000 react or react native plugins once
00:37:00.119 you've created this route we have to
00:37:01.599 figure out how we can get to it from the
00:37:03.800 index route so let's head over into the
00:37:06.400 index and just below the view that says
00:37:09.119 welcome let's put a link coming from
00:37:12.319 Expo router and let's give it an href of
00:37:15.440 SL onboarding and it can simply say
00:37:17.960 onboarding if we save it you can see it
00:37:20.240 right here on your screen and if you try
00:37:22.240 clicking on it you can see that it says
00:37:24.000 unmatched route but let's first reload
00:37:26.800 I'll open up my terminal and press the
00:37:28.599 letter R and click on onboarding and
00:37:31.480 there we go we have been redirected to
00:37:33.480 the onboarding screen and now you can
00:37:35.280 use all your devices native back and
00:37:37.760 forward functionalities such as on
00:37:39.839 iPhone it is normal to scroll from left
00:37:42.040 to right to go back this works
00:37:44.880 seamlessly similarly let's say you want
00:37:47.200 to create a route that shows the details
00:37:49.480 of a movie well we can create a new
00:37:51.960 folder and let's call it movie and
00:37:55.319 Within movie we can create a dynamic
00:37:57.920 route so that means creating a file in
00:38:01.319 which we wrap its name within square
00:38:03.560 brackets and you can Define what the
00:38:06.079 actual parameter is in this case I'll
00:38:08.640 wrap it in a square brackets of id.
00:38:12.319 TSX here you can once again run
00:38:16.680 rnf and this will create a boilerplate
00:38:19.119 function which we have to fix a bit I'll
00:38:21.240 call it details export default details
00:38:25.680 and we have a stylesheet at the bottom
00:38:28.079 so now the question is how can we know
00:38:30.079 on which movies Details page we're on
00:38:32.640 are we on the Iron Man's Details page or
00:38:35.280 bathman for example well we can extract
00:38:37.880 the route Pam information in Expo like
00:38:40.760 this by saying const D structure
00:38:43.839 whatever name or title you put within
00:38:46.240 the square brackets and then get it from
00:38:48.680 use local search prams coming from the
00:38:52.319 Expo router if you do this now you can
00:38:54.839 use this ID variable so I'll say movie
00:38:58.960 details and then I'll render the dynamic
00:39:01.680 ID right here so now back in our index.
00:39:05.839 DSX we can create another link and this
00:39:09.119 one will point to slov slash
00:39:14.960 Avengers and we can say Avenger
00:39:18.839 movie if we go back you can now see this
00:39:21.760 new link and don't forget to reload so
00:39:24.560 one more time just press the letter R
00:39:26.480 and wait until it reloads so we make
00:39:28.760 sure that this new route we created is
00:39:30.760 recognized you'll have to do this
00:39:32.319 whenever you add some new pages now if
00:39:34.760 you click on the second link you'll see
00:39:36.880 that we go to the movie Details page but
00:39:39.839 it knows that we are on the Avengers
00:39:42.119 movie details you can play with that a
00:39:44.079 bit more to fully understand how routing
00:39:46.240 works but what I'll do for now is remove
00:39:49.560 those two examples that we have
00:39:51.960 created by entirely removing the movie
00:39:54.640 folder as well as the onboarding file
00:39:57.640 that's because I want to teach you how
00:39:59.680 you would begin creating the screens for
00:40:02.160 your entire application by first looking
00:40:04.720 at the design this right here is a
00:40:07.560 typical react native application well it
00:40:10.400 definitely has a design better than most
00:40:12.160 of the apps out there but you get the
00:40:14.119 idea we have the homepage some kind of a
00:40:16.839 search page and also a Details page for
00:40:19.839 whatever it is that we're searching
00:40:21.119 through we also have a bottom navigation
00:40:23.720 for the home screen search saved and the
00:40:27.720 profile and of course there's also off
00:40:29.960 so if you'd like me to extend this react
00:40:32.040 native course to include authentication
00:40:33.800 2 let me know down below but with that
00:40:36.160 in mind we now have to figure out how
00:40:38.680 many screens we have and for each one of
00:40:40.960 these screens we have to give it a
00:40:42.800 proper route first of all there's the
00:40:45.560 home screen the search screen the save
00:40:49.280 or bookmark screen the profile screen
00:40:52.160 and finally the movie detail screen out
00:40:54.680 of these four screens we only want to
00:40:56.560 show the navigation for the first four
00:40:59.240 screens and not the movie details
00:41:01.640 because we'll get to the movie details
00:41:03.480 by of course clicking on the movie card
00:41:05.880 Expo allows us to do just that with
00:41:08.319 route grouping we can prevent a segment
00:41:11.599 from showing in the URL by using the
00:41:13.920 group syntax which is just a pair of
00:41:17.160 parentheses so for example if we have
00:41:19.880 app Root home. TSX it'll match to home
00:41:24.240 and if we don't put it into a route
00:41:25.920 group then we'll have to say root home
00:41:28.800 which we don't want to do so groups are
00:41:31.119 great for organizing sections of the app
00:41:33.800 so let me show you how we can group our
00:41:35.599 routes within the application first
00:41:37.760 let's create a group route folder for
00:41:40.160 our tabs I'll call it in parentheses
00:41:44.319 tabs within tabs we can create a newcore
00:41:48.040 layout. DSX so now we want to ensure
00:41:51.520 that we show the mobile navigation only
00:41:54.119 on that screen keep in mind that there
00:41:56.000 can only be one index. TSX route and
00:41:59.319 right now it is right here in the root
00:42:01.200 of the directory but we actually want to
00:42:03.359 put it within tabs because the homage is
00:42:05.839 a part of the tabs layout next let's
00:42:08.560 create the other three routes by
00:42:10.599 creating a new file and naming it
00:42:13.480 profile. TSX let's quickly run
00:42:17.599 rnfe which will quickly spin up a new
00:42:20.079 functional
00:42:21.079 component and let's create a second file
00:42:24.079 right here or a second screen should I
00:42:26.520 say and let's call it saved. TSX also
00:42:31.000 run rnf and finally create the last
00:42:34.440 screen let's call it search. TSX and run
00:42:39.839 rnfe now for the movie details since
00:42:42.760 it's outside of that tab layout we want
00:42:45.680 to create it within the app by creating
00:42:47.760 a new movies folder and within movies
00:42:51.800 create a new Dynamic route of id. DSX
00:42:56.359 Within square brackets there you can
00:42:58.880 also run rnf and make sure to fix the
00:43:01.760 name to movie
00:43:04.720 details there we
00:43:06.559 go perfect now we want to hide this ugly
00:43:10.680 header that we have right here at the
00:43:12.240 top that says index how can we do that
00:43:15.240 well we can head over into the app
00:43:17.280 layout. DSX that is this one that we had
00:43:20.240 from before not the one within tabs and
00:43:23.000 here we can expand the stack component
00:43:26.200 and within it we we can render something
00:43:27.960 known as a stack. screen which is a
00:43:31.000 self-closing component where we can give
00:43:33.440 it a name and say that it'll be a string
00:43:37.680 of tabs this is the route Group which we
00:43:40.319 created and we can also give it options
00:43:43.760 of header shown is false and we also
00:43:46.680 want to repeat this stack. screen for
00:43:51.559 our movie Details page by saying name is
00:43:54.720 equal to movie SL ID like this and we
00:43:59.119 can
00:44:00.040 say options header shown is set to false
00:44:04.520 if you save this and reload because the
00:44:07.240 header is still here well to hide it
00:44:10.040 completely we have to head over into the
00:44:12.280 underscore layout of the tabs folder and
00:44:15.920 then you can run
00:44:17.240 rnfe right here to create a new layout
00:44:20.480 instead of returning a view right here
00:44:22.720 let's instead return something known as
00:44:25.319 tabs coming from Expo router within tabs
00:44:29.280 you can render a tabs. screen component
00:44:32.800 it is a self-closing component that has
00:44:35.280 a name in this case it's index for the
00:44:38.160 homepage and then you can provide
00:44:40.160 additional options here you can also
00:44:43.319 provide a Heather shown is set to false
00:44:46.480 as well as a title sets to something
00:44:49.000 like home as this is the homepage now if
00:44:52.119 you reload your application by opening
00:44:54.400 up your terminal and pressing the letter
00:44:55.960 R you'll see that there is no header
00:44:58.079 shown on top and if I comment out this
00:45:01.040 tabs. screen you can see that we still
00:45:03.200 have index so it is hiding that single
00:45:06.359 route and then this one stack that
00:45:08.760 screen if you comment it out this one is
00:45:12.040 actually hiding the group route so we
00:45:14.599 are right now Under tabs
00:45:17.040 Index this one right here hides the
00:45:19.800 route groups header and this one right
00:45:22.280 here hides that specific screens header
00:45:25.760 and it also gives it a name which is
00:45:27.599 then shown right here at the bottom so
00:45:30.200 tabs allow you to modify how your bottom
00:45:32.440 navigation looks like now why did I say
00:45:34.400 modify and not create your tabs
00:45:37.640 navigation well that's because you can
00:45:39.800 see even though we have only declared
00:45:41.400 the Home Route immediately right of the
00:45:43.359 bat three additional routes are here and
00:45:46.599 they work out of the box we didn't do
00:45:49.040 anything but yet react native recognized
00:45:52.079 that we have three other routes right
00:45:54.200 here profile saved search and the the
00:45:57.200 home and at the bottom we can switch
00:45:59.480 between them but what tabs allow to do
00:46:02.119 is to further customize them so let me
00:46:04.400 say tabs.
00:46:06.119 screen make it self-closing and let's
00:46:09.359 give it a name of search as well as the
00:46:11.880 options of title search and header shown
00:46:15.240 set to false so now we can see it has a
00:46:17.520 capital S right here and let's duplicate
00:46:20.000 it two more
00:46:21.280 times this one for the saved so let me
00:46:25.359 call it name saved and title of Saved
00:46:28.720 make sure that you called it exactly as
00:46:30.599 you did right here and the last one will
00:46:33.119 be profile and I'll call it
00:46:36.160 profile so now no matter in which route
00:46:38.680 we are you can see that the header is
00:46:40.760 hidden but this results in a super basic
00:46:43.960 boring navigation to make it look more
00:46:46.160 similar to what we have on the design we
00:46:48.280 have to customize it by defining
00:46:50.119 different icons for each tab of the
00:46:52.200 navigation screen so I took the time to
00:46:54.760 find some cool images and icons so I can
00:46:57.119 share them with you below this lesson
00:46:59.319 you'll find this Project's video kit
00:47:01.400 which includes the link to the project
00:47:02.880 repo which then includes the readme that
00:47:05.880 has the assets so simply go here and
00:47:08.880 download them once you download them
00:47:11.280 simply unzip them head over within your
00:47:13.559 project and delete the current assets
00:47:15.839 folder as we don't need it then simply
00:47:18.440 drag and drop all of these folders
00:47:20.559 within your movie app there we go I'll
00:47:24.400 now explain everything that we brought
00:47:25.920 in here first we have the assets the
00:47:29.319 assets contain the font that we'll be
00:47:30.960 using some icons such as the home logo
00:47:34.680 person and more and also some images
00:47:37.680 like the background image the Highlight
00:47:39.920 logo and more we also have some
00:47:42.240 constants such as the icons and images
00:47:45.200 where we export all of these images from
00:47:47.319 a single file with a specific name so
00:47:49.960 it's easier to import them later on and
00:47:52.359 we also have some interfaces so the
00:47:54.400 typescript knows what kind of fields
00:47:56.839 will each one of our documents have so
00:47:59.160 with that in mind let's head back over
00:48:01.040 to our tabs layout to make our Tabs go
00:48:05.000 from this right here at the bottom to
00:48:07.800 something that looks more like this we
00:48:10.440 can start customizing them let's start
00:48:12.880 with the Home tab button react native
00:48:16.079 specifically the Tab screen allows us to
00:48:18.559 specify how the tab bar icon will look
00:48:21.559 like you can provide a callback function
00:48:24.839 where you get access to the state of
00:48:26.960 that specific icon whether it has
00:48:28.920 currently been clicked or not and then
00:48:31.760 here we can return an empty react
00:48:34.480 fragment for now and within it we can
00:48:37.520 return maybe like a background image
00:48:40.640 what do you think so first I'll return
00:48:43.280 an image background coming from react
00:48:46.760 native that'll have a source equal to
00:48:51.440 images make sure to click enter right
00:48:54.359 here before you finish typing them to a
00:48:56.880 to import them from constants my
00:48:59.119 webstorm did that very nicely for me
00:49:00.960 here so you can see that I imported
00:49:02.480 images from add/ constants SL images and
00:49:06.880 then we can say images. highlight
00:49:09.760 highlight is this little part so when
00:49:11.640 we're currently on that screen you can
00:49:13.520 show this little pill likee shape next
00:49:16.359 within this image background we can
00:49:18.359 render a regular image coming from react
00:49:21.040 native with a source equal to
00:49:24.640 images. home and we can give it a tint
00:49:28.079 color equal to
00:49:30.599 # 151
00:49:33.480 312 as well as a class name equal to
00:49:39.119 size-5 and we can close it right here
00:49:42.200 and we can also give it a text property
00:49:45.400 that'll simply render the word home okay
00:49:48.359 so now this is looking a bit off
00:49:50.359 definitely not what we expected so let's
00:49:53.200 style it a bit I'll give this Source a
00:49:56.240 class name equal to flex Flex - row w-
00:50:02.599 full Flex
00:50:04.480 D1 m-w of 112 pixels I found this value
00:50:11.000 to work the best with a Min height of 14
00:50:15.079 a margin top of
00:50:16.960 four justify Dash center items Das
00:50:21.040 Center to fully Center it rounded Das
00:50:23.760 full and overflow Das
00:50:27.160 there we go so now we have this real
00:50:28.960 pill like shape if it's active let's
00:50:31.440 also render an actual icon it is under
00:50:34.640 icons. home but also make sure to import
00:50:37.680 the icons from constants and now we can
00:50:40.119 see this icon and we can style this text
00:50:43.280 by giving it a class name of text-
00:50:46.319 secondary
00:50:48.359 text-base font D
00:50:51.400 semibold and margin left off
00:50:54.799 two okay so this is looking good now we
00:50:57.760 want to repeat this for every single
00:50:59.839 icon and instead of copying this code
00:51:02.000 and duplicating it four times let's
00:51:04.119 actually extract it into its own custom
00:51:07.200 component so this is not a react native
00:51:10.319 specific thing it is just how we do
00:51:12.160 things around react so take this as a
00:51:14.640 mini lesson whenever you have to repeat
00:51:17.160 this multiple times it's better to
00:51:20.000 extract it okay so now I'll take this
00:51:23.160 entire image background and I'll create
00:51:26.240 a new component out of it by saying
00:51:28.760 const tab icon is equal to a functional
00:51:32.839 component that returns this image
00:51:35.720 background which I can just space right
00:51:37.720 here but it seems like we have an error
00:51:39.520 so let's put this component to use by
00:51:42.000 rendering it right here instead of the
00:51:44.440 code that was previously on here tab
00:51:47.079 icon and immediately we get the same
00:51:49.319 output but it looks so much better but
00:51:52.559 now here's the problem whenever you
00:51:54.319 extract something into a custom
00:51:55.960 component
00:51:57.040 well how are you going to reuse it right
00:51:59.359 because now if I head into the options
00:52:01.160 of the search screen and I say something
00:52:03.920 like tab bar icon where again we can
00:52:07.559 Define how it looks like and then I
00:52:10.880 specify that I want to show some kind of
00:52:12.559 an icon well what happens it's going to
00:52:15.799 be the same one as in the home so of
00:52:17.920 course we want to figure out a way of
00:52:20.200 how we can differentiate those two
00:52:22.839 places where that component is being
00:52:24.799 used and here this is a mini lesson on
00:52:28.599 reusability you want to figure out how
00:52:31.079 to make a custom component reusable and
00:52:34.480 you can do that of course through props
00:52:37.160 so many things here are always going to
00:52:38.920 be the same such as the image background
00:52:40.880 component the classes we're going to use
00:52:43.480 and the colors of the text but what will
00:52:46.079 change is going to be the icon the text
00:52:50.079 and maybe the state of the focus are we
00:52:52.240 currently on home or are we on search so
00:52:54.839 whatever changes from component to
00:52:56.559 component you have to pass it as a prop
00:52:59.400 I'll pass a focus State equal to focused
00:53:02.720 as well as an icon equal to icons. home
00:53:06.440 as well as a title equal to home and
00:53:09.640 I'll put it into multiple lines so it's
00:53:11.799 easier to read I'll copy it and I'll
00:53:14.319 paste it right here for the search but
00:53:17.040 for the search of course it's not going
00:53:19.040 to be just icons. home it's going to be
00:53:21.680 icons. search and the title will be set
00:53:24.680 to search
00:53:26.680 and now we can also just copy this
00:53:28.400 entire tab bar icon and add it for the
00:53:31.480 other two icons this one the third one
00:53:35.359 will actually be called save so I'll say
00:53:38.440 tab icon icons Dove and the title can be
00:53:42.880 saved the icon name is save without the
00:53:45.920 D but I decided to add the D right here
00:53:48.599 saved and finally the last one will be
00:53:51.640 the profile so here we can render
00:53:54.520 focused icons. person and the title will
00:53:58.760 be profile now if I save this you can
00:54:02.200 still see that all four of them say home
00:54:05.319 but now let me collapse them just so you
00:54:07.640 can see how tidy this looks like there
00:54:10.359 we go so now we have four different tab
00:54:13.200 screens with different titles and icons
00:54:15.839 and the only thing we have to do is
00:54:18.079 extract those props right here at the
00:54:20.240 top focused icon and title for now we
00:54:24.640 can make them of the type any and we
00:54:26.680 have to use them whenever something has
00:54:28.400 to be dynamic so instead of icons.
00:54:31.160 something I'll simply render the icon
00:54:34.040 through passing through props and here
00:54:36.119 instead of saying home I will render the
00:54:38.720 title if I now save this you can see
00:54:41.400 that the icons for all four of them have
00:54:43.680 changed also not always we want to show
00:54:46.400 this image background we only want to
00:54:48.319 show it if it's focused so I'll say if
00:54:51.880 focused in that case we can return
00:54:56.440 whatever is right here so I'll indent it
00:54:58.880 properly and end it else I'll return
00:55:02.559 something much simpler like a simple
00:55:05.440 view that'll render an image of a source
00:55:08.920 equal to Icon a tint color equal to #
00:55:13.880 a8b 5db and a class name of size of five
00:55:19.160 of course import the view from react
00:55:21.240 native and give it a class name of size-
00:55:24.960 FO justify - center items Das Center
00:55:29.559 margin top of four and the rounded Das
00:55:32.640 full if you do that you'll notice that
00:55:35.280 now the icons are going to look much
00:55:37.160 better so let's collapse our tab icon
00:55:40.480 and let's further customize how all of
00:55:42.760 the icons together look we can do that
00:55:45.000 through options not on the individual
00:55:47.319 tab screens but we can do it directly on
00:55:50.400 the tabs by saying screen options and
00:55:54.720 here can say tab bar show label we can
00:55:58.960 set that to false so now we have no
00:56:01.480 labels just the icons we can also modify
00:56:04.920 the tab bar item style and I'll give it
00:56:08.240 a width of
00:56:10.280 100% a height of 100% as well I'll give
00:56:15.799 it a Justified content of Center as well
00:56:19.039 as a line items off center as well and
00:56:22.760 we can also modify the tab bar Style so
00:56:26.520 this is the entire tab on its own where
00:56:29.160 I'll change the background color to Hash
00:56:32.520 0 F0
00:56:34.920 d23 border radius will be set to about
00:56:39.119 50 there we go we can also give it a
00:56:42.359 margin horizontal of about 20 let's also
00:56:45.960 give it a margin bottom of
00:56:48.760 36 a height of 52 a position of absolute
00:56:54.920 overflow of hidden and Border width of
00:57:00.079 just
00:57:01.400 one with a border color which is going
00:57:04.480 to be the same color we used above 0 F0
00:57:08.319 d23 and there we have it we have a
00:57:10.920 navigation bar that looks much more
00:57:12.880 similar to the one we have here to make
00:57:15.039 it perfect we just have to fix this
00:57:17.119 small little inconsistency where the
00:57:19.200 height of this pill like shape is not
00:57:21.760 matching the height of the entire bar so
00:57:24.039 let's quickly head over into the tab
00:57:25.799 icon and increase the mint age from 14
00:57:29.240 to 16 and that did the trick perfect so
00:57:33.720 now take your phone in your hand and
00:57:35.799 just click between different pages
00:57:37.839 you'll only see welcome on the home
00:57:39.440 screen and the rest of the pages will
00:57:41.599 appear blank but if you pay close
00:57:43.839 attention to the top left corner you'll
00:57:46.000 see that some text is changing it's just
00:57:48.160 that it's not visible within our current
00:57:50.839 view but if you've been paying close
00:57:52.760 attention to the crash course I already
00:57:54.559 mentioned that there's an element that
00:57:55.920 can help us make sure that everything
00:57:57.880 fits nicely within the screen so we'll
00:58:00.520 explore it soon but I'm already super
00:58:02.599 happy with this because you have just
00:58:04.720 implemented a fully functional routing
00:58:07.280 system with a custom bottom navigation
00:58:10.280 bar that allows us to switch between
00:58:12.680 four different screens great job I know
00:58:16.119 this was a long lesson so I'll keep the
00:58:18.559 next one much shorter but equally as
00:58:21.359 important I'll show you how to customize
00:58:23.319 the logo of your application so when
00:58:25.720 users want to use it they know where to
00:58:29.559 click before we start developing this
00:58:32.200 beautiful home screen UI I want to
00:58:34.240 quickly show you how you can customize
00:58:35.880 your Expo app to show the logo of your
00:58:38.079 application when it's loading if you
00:58:40.559 check out your terminal you'll see an
00:58:42.200 error saying asset not found and right
00:58:45.039 here unable to resolve your asset assets
00:58:48.240 images icon.png within your app.js or
00:58:52.039 app.config DJs this is because when we
00:58:55.640 change the assets we're no longer
00:58:57.760 satisfying the need of our app.js to
00:59:01.000 show our applications icon it's pointing
00:59:03.760 to a pad that doesn't exist so let's fix
00:59:06.720 it we can show an icon called assets
00:59:10.200 images
00:59:12.039 logo.png you can copy it that full path
00:59:15.359 and we can also change it for Android as
00:59:17.799 the foreground image and while we're
00:59:20.839 here let's also change it for the web
00:59:24.000 right here as the favicon oh and right
00:59:26.880 here under the Expo splash screen let's
00:59:29.079 modify it here as well perfect so once
00:59:31.480 you do this open up your terminal and
00:59:34.240 press R to reload your application for
00:59:36.839 the changes to take effect as soon as it
00:59:38.960 bundles the error will be gone and our
00:59:41.440 icon will be applied so now if you
00:59:43.680 reopen your XO app you should be able to
00:59:45.920 see something like this mobile movie app
00:59:48.599 right here or if you want to change the
00:59:50.480 name too to something better like movie
00:59:53.599 Flex you can do that too and for this
00:59:56.440 change you'll actually have to reopen
00:59:58.319 your Expo app and rescan the QR code
01:00:02.520 too there we go now we can see this icon
01:00:05.480 even on the splash screen and when you
01:00:07.520 open it within Expo there we go both the
01:00:10.200 icon and the title are here too of
01:00:12.680 course we're within Expo right now but
01:00:15.200 this would be reflected on your devic's
01:00:17.799 home screen I mean just imagine opening
01:00:20.160 up your iPhone or Android device and
01:00:22.440 seeing your app on the home screen right
01:00:24.319 there with its icon and the title pretty
01:00:27.160 cool right there we go as promised this
01:00:29.559 was a short and sweet lesson next we can
01:00:32.960 focus on a super important part of this
01:00:35.160 course which is building out the UI of
01:00:38.039 our homepage so let's do that
01:00:42.200 next to start developing the UI over our
01:00:45.200 home screen head over into app tabs and
01:00:49.000 then index.ts X here is where we have
01:00:52.000 this welcome so for now let's focus on
01:00:54.640 implementing the header component
01:00:56.559 I'll clear this entire View and create
01:00:59.559 another this one will have a class name
01:01:03.039 equal to flex das1 and BG of primary
01:01:07.440 finally we're going to go away from this
01:01:09.319 light screen to a nice dark color within
01:01:12.559 this view we can render an image coming
01:01:15.240 from react native see how webstorm very
01:01:18.079 easily Auto Imports it at the top and we
01:01:21.079 can render a source and give it a source
01:01:23.680 of images now keep in mind if I just
01:01:25.720 press press enter it'll autoimport it
01:01:27.960 once again from at/ constants SL images
01:01:32.119 and I'll call the images. BG for the
01:01:35.400 background let's position it a bit by
01:01:37.880 giving it a class name equal to Absolute
01:01:41.640 let's also give it a w full so it takes
01:01:43.839 the full width of the screen as well as
01:01:46.319 a z index of zero so we can show some
01:01:48.559 elements on top of it right below it we
01:01:51.000 can render a scroll view this is used to
01:01:54.240 make the whole screen scrollable so if
01:01:56.680 there's a lot of vertical content that
01:01:58.880 might not fit within a single view then
01:02:01.559 you need to wrap everything within a
01:02:03.119 scroll view for users with smaller
01:02:05.039 devices to be able to see it let's give
01:02:07.799 it a class name equal to flex D1 and a
01:02:12.480 padding X of five to give it some
01:02:14.359 horizontal spacing within it for now
01:02:16.880 let's just render a single image that'll
01:02:20.000 have a source equal to
01:02:23.319 icons again coming from constants . logo
01:02:27.279 with a class name equal to W of 12 for
01:02:31.319 the width h of 10 for the height margin
01:02:34.920 top of 20 to divide it a bit from the
01:02:36.960 top margin bottom of five and margin X
01:02:40.680 of Auto to center it in the middle there
01:02:43.480 we go this is starting to look like a
01:02:45.200 real app already now if we had more
01:02:47.520 content we would have this ugly scroll
01:02:49.520 bar at the right side so to remove it we
01:02:52.279 can give an additional prop to the
01:02:54.240 scroll view called show or rather shows
01:02:58.160 vertical scroll indicator which I'll set
01:03:00.839 to false and I'll also give it a
01:03:04.359 Content container style which will be
01:03:08.200 equal to an object where Min height will
01:03:11.240 be set to 100% And also padding bottom
01:03:15.400 will be set to 10 so now you can see if
01:03:18.079 you scroll up and down it kind of moves
01:03:20.640 the logo moves right but we have no
01:03:22.559 content to show so very soon we'll be
01:03:25.039 able to add some content but first
01:03:27.079 things first we have to ask ourselves
01:03:28.799 what is the first thing that we want to
01:03:30.400 show on the homepage and it'll be the
01:03:33.039 search bar which will be our first
01:03:35.160 component of the day so let's create a
01:03:38.039 new components
01:03:42.400 folder and within it let's create a new
01:03:45.760 file called search
01:03:48.920 bar. TSX and within it run
01:03:53.079 rnfe to quickly create a new component
01:03:57.039 now we want to be able to see that
01:03:58.599 component somewhere so let's head back
01:04:01.400 into the index. TSX and let's head right
01:04:04.960 below this logo image and render The
01:04:09.279 View that'll have a class name of Flex
01:04:13.000 one and margin top of five and within it
01:04:16.640 just render a self-closing search bar
01:04:19.119 bar component coming from at/ components
01:04:22.960 SL
01:04:24.480 searchbar now you won't be able to see
01:04:26.680 it yet because right now it is just a
01:04:28.839 single piece of text which is hard to
01:04:30.559 see on a dark background but of course
01:04:32.720 we're going to style it further so let's
01:04:34.839 start by giving this view a class name
01:04:37.640 equal to flex Das row items Das Center
01:04:42.279 BG dark 200 rounded Das full and padding
01:04:47.319 X of five as well as padding y of four
01:04:50.720 to create some spacing in between it we
01:04:53.200 can render an image which is going to be
01:04:55.680 kind of like a search icon so let's
01:04:57.839 import the image component and give it a
01:05:00.559 source equal to icons.
01:05:03.680 search with a class name equal to size
01:05:07.319 of
01:05:08.200 five a resize mode equal to
01:05:13.440 contain as well as a tint color equal to
01:05:17.480 Hash
01:05:19.119 AB8 BFF and of course don't forget to
01:05:22.640 import the icons coming from constant
01:05:26.319 if you do that you should be able to see
01:05:28.279 this little icon at the top left below
01:05:31.000 it we can render a text input okay so a
01:05:34.799 text input is like an input component in
01:05:37.279 react or in regular HTML and it allows
01:05:40.640 you to pass similar things to it such as
01:05:43.640 the onpress functionality which for now
01:05:45.880 I'll just leave as an empty coolback
01:05:47.400 function a placeholder that you can pass
01:05:49.880 to it which can be something like search
01:05:52.000 for now a value which can be equal to an
01:05:55.400 empty string for now an onchange text
01:05:59.279 which for now will be equal to an empty
01:06:01.160 callback function a placeholder text
01:06:04.400 color which can be similar to our tint
01:06:06.359 color
01:06:07.799 a8b 5db there we go now we can see it
01:06:11.920 and finally we can give it a class name
01:06:13.920 of flex D1 margin left of two and text-
01:06:18.480 white so now we have what appears to be
01:06:20.760 a very simple search and when you click
01:06:22.920 on it you can see that your keyboard
01:06:24.799 actually opens up giving you a way to
01:06:27.520 type something in now what we need to do
01:06:29.520 to make this somewhat functional is pass
01:06:32.119 the real onpress value from the index so
01:06:35.920 typically when you have smaller
01:06:37.279 components like a search bar on its own
01:06:39.920 it doesn't necessarily have to be
01:06:41.559 concerned with what it is doing
01:06:43.680 typically you have some logic that you
01:06:45.920 pass from the parent component to the
01:06:48.240 child component in this case the search
01:06:50.400 bar so what we can do is Define the
01:06:54.119 router right here here in the homepage
01:06:57.079 you can say something like import use
01:07:00.119 router coming from Expo router you can
01:07:03.680 Define that router right here by saying
01:07:06.119 const router is equal to use router by
01:07:09.760 the way this is the first time we're
01:07:11.160 using the router right here and what
01:07:12.960 we're doing here is essentially using
01:07:15.160 something known as a hook so in react
01:07:17.920 and therefore in react native when
01:07:20.279 something starts with the word use that
01:07:23.279 means that it is called a hook and hooks
01:07:26.400 are typically called at the top of our
01:07:28.400 functional components and then they
01:07:30.240 expose additional functionalities in
01:07:32.760 this case the router functionality
01:07:34.760 allows us to move between different
01:07:36.799 screens programmatically not necessarily
01:07:39.440 by clicking a button or something but we
01:07:41.680 can use it to go to another page or
01:07:43.799 screen when something happens in this
01:07:46.760 case I will pass two props to the search
01:07:49.839 bar the first one will be the onpress
01:07:52.839 functionality that will for now call the
01:07:55.079 call function and then call the router.
01:07:57.960 push which will push it to for SL search
01:08:02.240 okay so we want to move to the search
01:08:03.640 screen once pressed and I'll also pass a
01:08:06.520 placeholder equal to search for a movie
01:08:10.319 now if we head into the search bar we
01:08:12.559 can accept these different props so
01:08:15.240 right here at the top I can destructure
01:08:17.319 them and accept the placeholder as well
01:08:20.640 as the on press and these can be of a
01:08:23.238 type props so right above it we can
01:08:26.679 define a typescript interface called
01:08:29.880 props and just say that the placeholder
01:08:32.960 will always be of a type string and on
01:08:36.198 press will be optional and it'll be of a
01:08:40.120 type function that returns void meaning
01:08:43.359 nothing the goal of this function is not
01:08:45.520 to return something rather it is to use
01:08:48.920 the router functionality to push to a
01:08:51.080 different URL so if you haven't used
01:08:53.439 typescript before don't worry what this
01:08:55.920 interface does is it simply tells our
01:08:58.799 react application or react native in
01:09:00.600 this case what the types of those props
01:09:02.600 should be so now on press we can call
01:09:06.040 the onpress functionality that we're
01:09:07.880 passing through props and also we can
01:09:10.600 pass in the
01:09:12.399 placeholder there we go search for a
01:09:15.120 movie now check this out as soon as I
01:09:17.520 click search for a movie it actually
01:09:19.600 redirects me to another screen called
01:09:22.238 the search
01:09:23.198 screen which will Implement very very
01:09:25.679 very soon but of course it doesn't make
01:09:27.759 sense to start implementing the search a
01:09:29.880 movie screen if we don't yet have any
01:09:32.040 movies to search for so in the next
01:09:34.279 lesson let's go ahead and fetch the
01:09:36.198 movies data from a third party
01:09:39.759 API to fetch the movies for our great
01:09:43.080 mobile movie application we'll use tmdb
01:09:46.640 a database off I think every movie that
01:09:49.198 you can possibly think of this is their
01:09:51.080 public facing website but they also have
01:09:53.640 an API so if you Google for tmdb API
01:09:56.719 getting started or I'm going to also
01:09:58.480 leave the link in the description then
01:10:00.480 you'll be able to find this getting
01:10:02.080 started guide head over to the API
01:10:04.800 reference and here you'll be able to
01:10:06.719 give it a shot we'll be using no JS to
01:10:09.040 make the calls and you'll have to get
01:10:11.199 your API key it'll ask you to log into
01:10:13.760 your account or to create it if you
01:10:16.120 haven't before so feel free to create
01:10:17.960 your account as it is completely free
01:10:20.600 you don't have to worry about paying
01:10:22.040 anything and you'll get access to all
01:10:23.800 the data once you log in you'll be able
01:10:26.159 to see something like this which is your
01:10:28.000 account and then head back over to the
01:10:30.000 getting started guide and click the link
01:10:32.400 that says API link there we go here
01:10:34.880 you'll have your API read access token
01:10:37.520 so copy it and save it somewhere and do
01:10:39.880 the same thing for the API key head over
01:10:41.960 into the API reference and if you're
01:10:43.840 logged in you'll see that all of the
01:10:45.600 credentials will be filled in alongside
01:10:47.880 a demo request that you can try in this
01:10:50.040 case they're making a request to the
01:10:51.280 authentication so if I click try it you
01:10:53.840 can see that it succeeded in this case
01:10:56.360 we'll be using the endpoint for
01:10:58.320 discovering movies so search for
01:11:01.080 discover movie and you'll quickly be
01:11:03.600 able to find that movies is deprecated
01:11:06.760 but you should use discover movie
01:11:09.320 instead and it tells you right here
01:11:11.520 which API request you have to call find
01:11:13.560 movies using over 30 filters and sort
01:11:15.880 options and it tells you right here what
01:11:18.120 you can pass over into it we can also
01:11:20.480 give it a shot by clicking try it and
01:11:22.760 then you get back the total number of
01:11:24.640 pages which is
01:11:26.440 49,000 pages that has almost 1 million
01:11:31.120 movies and here of course you get more
01:11:33.560 details for every single one out of
01:11:36.280 those almost 1 million movies how cool
01:11:39.920 is that now let's actually try to call
01:11:42.719 this within our code let's go ahead and
01:11:44.679 copy this entire fetch request by
01:11:47.440 selecting it and then pressing control
01:11:49.280 or command C and then heading back
01:11:51.440 within our code we'll create a new
01:11:53.120 folder that we'll use for the API
01:11:55.360 configuration so let's create a new
01:11:57.719 folder let's call it
01:12:00.400 services and within Services let's
01:12:02.840 create a new file called api. TS within
01:12:06.920 it for now you can paste this request
01:12:08.960 that we just copied but comment it out
01:12:12.080 we first want to set it up from scratch
01:12:14.120 so it's fully reusable and more
01:12:16.679 structured first things first we need to
01:12:18.480 extract this key that was given to you
01:12:21.159 so if you head back to your credentials
01:12:22.960 header select it and copy it you can now
01:12:25.960 store it in a more convenient place such
01:12:28.719 as a EnV file this stands for
01:12:32.239 environment variables and make sure that
01:12:34.480 it is in the root of your directory I'll
01:12:36.560 call it Expo coru if you're going to use
01:12:40.199 it on the front and side of your Expo
01:12:41.800 application you have to preen the name
01:12:44.159 of your environment variable with Expo
01:12:46.440 public and then say movie API key and
01:12:50.239 paste your environment key now we won't
01:12:52.840 have to every time spell it out within
01:12:54.400 our code for every body to see but we'll
01:12:56.560 be able to just refer to this variable
01:12:58.920 so instead of just making one single
01:13:00.840 request let's actually form a tmdb
01:13:03.760 configuration that is reusable so we can
01:13:06.480 actually change the way we interact with
01:13:08.719 it we can call it for multiple different
01:13:10.960 endpoints to do that you can export
01:13:14.280 const
01:13:16.199 tmdb config and it'll be equal to a
01:13:19.840 single object within the object we can
01:13:23.239 first pass the base URL like this and
01:13:27.320 the base URL will be this starting part
01:13:29.880 up to the part where the endpoint will
01:13:31.639 actually change so sometimes it'll be
01:13:33.880 discover movie sometimes it'll be my
01:13:36.400 profile for example but there's always a
01:13:39.360 base URL that each API has so https
01:13:44.400 Colin api. theme.org
01:13:48.520 sl3 and leave out the last forward slash
01:13:51.920 we don't need it here next we have to
01:13:54.080 pass the API iore key which will be
01:13:57.360 equal to process. env. EXO
01:14:01.520 undoru moviecore API undor key this is
01:14:06.040 coming from our environment variables
01:14:08.120 next we can pass the headers that we're
01:14:10.040 making with the request where we're
01:14:12.719 going to pass the accept property to let
01:14:15.000 it know what kind of data should it
01:14:17.159 accept and this will be equal to
01:14:19.280 application Json and also we have to
01:14:21.960 pass the authorization header which is
01:14:24.440 equal to a template string of Bearer and
01:14:28.080 then you once again render the process.
01:14:30.440 env. Expo public movie API key we're not
01:14:34.320 spelling it out like this perfect so
01:14:36.840 with that we have basically utilized
01:14:38.920 this entire part and the only thing that
01:14:40.800 remains to be changed is the URL that
01:14:43.400 we're calling so in this case you can
01:14:45.840 see we're looking for forward slcover
01:14:48.440 for/ movie but now that we have this
01:14:50.679 configuration object it'll be super
01:14:52.800 simple to create a function that just
01:14:55.080 call one endpoint let me show you export
01:14:58.520 const fetch movies is equal to an
01:15:01.800 asynchronous function that will accept a
01:15:04.280 search query and we can open up a code
01:15:07.239 block now for this query we also have to
01:15:10.239 pass the type and we can say that the
01:15:12.159 query is of a type string it'll look
01:15:14.800 something like this next we have to
01:15:16.719 define the endpoint that we're calling
01:15:18.719 so I'll say con endpoint is equal to
01:15:22.360 slash discover slovie question mark sort
01:15:26.840 by popularity descending so this will
01:15:29.800 give us the most popular movies then we
01:15:32.239 have to get the response out of that
01:15:33.920 call by saying const response is equal
01:15:36.639 to
01:15:38.120 await fetch we're going to fetch a
01:15:41.440 specific endpoint with the following
01:15:43.679 options I'll pass the method of get so
01:15:47.360 we want to make a get call and I will
01:15:50.159 also assign the headers to be equal to
01:15:53.639 tmdb config do headers finally we'll
01:15:57.440 check if the response is not okay so if
01:16:02.360 not response okay then throw new error
01:16:05.800 failed to fetch movies and we can also
01:16:08.159 consol log the response. status text to
01:16:11.120 see exactly what went wrong I'll
01:16:13.440 suppress this TS warning right now
01:16:15.480 because I assume there will be a
01:16:17.320 response. status text that might give us
01:16:19.440 more info and then if everything is okay
01:16:21.920 we can extract the data from the
01:16:23.560 response by saying respon data is equal
01:16:26.239 to await response. Json and finally we
01:16:30.120 just want to return the
01:16:31.719 data. results which contains the actual
01:16:34.480 movies out from this function and this
01:16:37.040 would be great I mean this works
01:16:39.280 amazingly well for just fetching the
01:16:41.159 most popular movies you could say fetch
01:16:43.880 popular movies and you would be good to
01:16:45.840 go with this function but I want to
01:16:48.000 teach you how to make it more modular
01:16:50.320 how to make it work both for fetching
01:16:52.320 the popular movies as well as to work
01:16:55.239 for fetching the movies that we search
01:16:57.639 for so if a user heads over and clicks
01:17:00.199 search right here we actually want to
01:17:01.880 use the same function not create a
01:17:04.120 duplicate one that'll fetch the movies
01:17:06.239 based on the user's search query so what
01:17:08.600 you can do is say that the endpoint is
01:17:11.719 equal to and then if there is a query so
01:17:16.239 if query exists then we can change the
01:17:20.120 endpoint to be equal to/ search slov
01:17:25.000 question mark query is equal to and now
01:17:28.360 here we can pass over the query like
01:17:30.800 this but whenever you pass plain strings
01:17:33.880 into a URL it is always better to encode
01:17:36.840 them just to make sure that we don't
01:17:38.239 have any weird characters that the
01:17:39.800 browser might not be able to process so
01:17:42.520 you can write in code URI component and
01:17:45.880 then pass the query into it this way
01:17:49.320 we'll be sure that everything is good
01:17:51.679 and then if we don't have the query
01:17:53.560 simply search for the the latest movies
01:17:55.880 now the final thing we need to do to
01:17:57.440 make this work is also make the bottom
01:17:59.639 one a template string why because for
01:18:02.840 both of these we actually want to add
01:18:05.120 the
01:18:06.040 tmdb config dobas URL at the start of
01:18:10.320 them so everything starts with this base
01:18:13.320 URL and then we're changing the exact
01:18:15.840 endpoint depending on whether we have
01:18:17.960 the query and if so we pass it or if not
01:18:21.480 give me all the most popular movies I
01:18:24.040 think you can now understand a bit more
01:18:25.679 detail of what I meant when I said that
01:18:28.000 we're going to make this reusable and
01:18:29.960 just better configured and it makes
01:18:31.639 sense because the endpoint is different
01:18:33.880 but the actual data we turning from the
01:18:36.080 function is still the same they are
01:18:38.920 movies so with that in mind you have
01:18:41.280 successfully created an account on tmtb
01:18:44.360 you extracted your own API key for free
01:18:47.880 and you made a function that fetches the
01:18:50.199 movies either the most popular ones or
01:18:52.920 the ones that match the user's query
01:18:54.880 very soon we'll put it to use but just
01:18:57.280 before that in the next lesson I'll show
01:18:59.560 you one more optimization that we can
01:19:01.199 make to use the fetch movies functions
01:19:03.159 we created in a more optimized
01:19:06.560 way in the previous lesson we
01:19:08.960 implemented this fetch movies function
01:19:12.480 but before diving into using it which
01:19:14.960 involves API calls using the use effect
01:19:18.000 hook managing loading and error States
01:19:21.040 and potentially clattering our code with
01:19:23.040 repetitive logic there's a more
01:19:25.560 efficient approach instead of repeating
01:19:28.080 the same code for every request we can
01:19:30.600 improve this process by using something
01:19:33.000 known as a custom hook this hook will
01:19:36.080 handle fetching the data in a clean
01:19:38.440 reusable and scalable way so let's
01:19:41.280 create a new file within the services
01:19:43.400 folder and let's call it use fetch. TS
01:19:48.760 and we can develop that custom hook this
01:19:50.840 hook will allow us to handle API
01:19:52.920 requests without cluttering the
01:19:55.000 components by abstracting away the logic
01:19:58.159 for fetching the data managing loading
01:20:00.440 and error States and it'll even provide
01:20:02.880 us with a way to manually trigger a
01:20:05.120 refetch when needed let me show you how
01:20:07.400 it'll look like we can say const use
01:20:10.440 fetch again notice the keyword use
01:20:13.159 indicating that it is a hook and we can
01:20:15.320 make it equal to a function call and we
01:20:18.480 can make it equal to an arrow
01:20:20.360 function now bear with me for a second
01:20:23.320 the use fetch hook will accept the fetch
01:20:27.239 function as a parameter okay so what can
01:20:31.800 this fetch function be well it can be
01:20:34.159 like fetch movies or it can be something
01:20:36.639 else maybe like fetch movie details
01:20:40.000 whatever it
01:20:41.080 is we're going to pass it into this use
01:20:43.800 fetch call so it'll look something like
01:20:46.080 this use fetch fetch movies we
01:20:49.360 immediately have to let it know that the
01:20:51.080 first parameter will be that fetch
01:20:53.040 function and we need to Define its type
01:20:56.280 and the type will be a function that
01:21:00.080 returns a promise and the promise will
01:21:03.679 be of a generic type t t makes it a
01:21:08.080 generic function allowing us to later on
01:21:10.760 pass the specific data types that we
01:21:13.120 want the function return to be it'll all
01:21:15.360 make sense once we start using it we
01:21:17.480 also have to add this generic T
01:21:19.440 parameter here and as the second
01:21:21.320 parameter we'll pass the autof Fetch and
01:21:23.920 make it equal to the true if you don't
01:21:25.800 understand what this means specifically
01:21:27.560 This Promise generic parameter T again
01:21:30.679 don't worry about it I'll explain it in
01:21:32.560 more detail once we actually start using
01:21:34.800 this function great with that said this
01:21:37.440 use fetch function will have to work
01:21:39.280 with some kind of data so we can create
01:21:41.440 a new state called data and set data
01:21:45.920 which will be equal to the use State
01:21:48.320 hook and it'll be of a type t or null
01:21:52.880 you define it right here before we open
01:21:55.920 the function call of this function and
01:21:58.880 by default we'll set it to null next we
01:22:02.040 need to define the loading and set
01:22:03.960 loading at the start equal to false and
01:22:07.639 also the errors const error set error is
01:22:11.239 equal to the use state where the type of
01:22:13.800 that state is either an error or a null
01:22:16.760 by
01:22:17.560 default now that we have implemented
01:22:19.800 those different states let's create a
01:22:22.000 function const fetch data which will be
01:22:25.239 equal to an asynchronous function within
01:22:28.320 which we can open up a try and catch
01:22:32.360 Block in the catch we'll of course get
01:22:35.040 the access to the error I'll shorten it
01:22:37.719 for err and within it we can set
01:22:41.639 error if an error is an instance of
01:22:47.239 error then I'll just forward the entire
01:22:50.360 error else I'll just create a new error
01:22:53.840 and pass in a string of an error
01:22:57.480 occurred and also press the typescript
01:22:59.880 right here for this line by saying TS
01:23:02.239 ignore then we're going to also add a
01:23:04.880 finally Clause finally block of code
01:23:07.480 gets executed either when a try succeeds
01:23:10.920 or a catch finishes either way we want
01:23:13.760 to set loading to false but now what we
01:23:16.440 care about the most is dealing with the
01:23:18.560 tri block which means actually fetching
01:23:20.760 the data first we're going to set
01:23:23.480 loading to true because we want to start
01:23:26.520 the loading action we're going to also
01:23:29.440 reset the error to false or rather null
01:23:33.159 there is no error and then we can say
01:23:37.000 const result is equal to await fetch
01:23:43.120 function so keep in mind that this fetch
01:23:45.400 function is not yet declared the fetch
01:23:48.280 function will be passed through props
01:23:50.880 and it can be either the fetch movies
01:23:52.920 function which we created not not long
01:23:54.800 ago or maybe another function which will
01:23:57.280 create in the future like fetch movie
01:23:59.320 details or maybe another function which
01:24:01.840 will create soon in any case the
01:24:04.440 function we want to call will be passed
01:24:06.840 through as the first parameter to the
01:24:08.560 use fetch hook and then we'll call it
01:24:10.520 right here get the results and simply
01:24:13.400 set them to the data so set data is
01:24:16.239 equal to result also below this entire
01:24:19.960 fetch data function we can also have a
01:24:22.560 reset function so con
01:24:25.040 reset is equal to an error function
01:24:28.760 where we set the data to null set the
01:24:30.920 loading to false and set the error to
01:24:32.920 now as well finally I'll also create a
01:24:35.560 use effect hook and a use effect Hook is
01:24:38.800 called when you want to do something at
01:24:40.679 the start of your component load so in
01:24:43.719 this case as soon as the component loads
01:24:46.679 we want to check if autof fetch is
01:24:49.239 turned on that means that we want to
01:24:51.960 automatically fetch the data in that
01:24:53.600 case so if if autof fetch is true we'll
01:24:55.800 simply call the fetch data
01:24:57.719 function finally hooks have to return
01:25:00.719 something so I'll return almost
01:25:03.280 everything the data State the loading
01:25:05.840 State the error State the refetch
01:25:08.880 function which I'll call fetch data as
01:25:11.960 well as the reset function so later on
01:25:14.639 when we use this hook it is dealing with
01:25:17.000 everything data related fetching
01:25:19.320 loadings errors and finally the data
01:25:22.080 that it's returning so let's say export
01:25:25.400 default use fetch so that in the next
01:25:28.280 lesson we can use the use fetch hook as
01:25:31.239 well as use the fetch movies function
01:25:33.679 merge them together to be able to fetch
01:25:36.320 and display
01:25:39.040 movies and we are finally ready to fetch
01:25:42.280 and display the movie data to do that
01:25:45.080 let's head over into our homepage app
01:25:48.560 tabs index. TSX fetching the data now
01:25:52.040 should be super simple since we have
01:25:54.360 already done all the hard work of
01:25:56.239 actually implementing scalable reusable
01:25:58.600 fetching functions that contain all of
01:26:00.840 the necessary data fetching logic let me
01:26:03.159 show you what I mean instead of handling
01:26:05.320 all the states and everything right here
01:26:08.080 now we can do just a single thing const
01:26:11.600 destructure the data that we're going to
01:26:14.000 fetch rename it to
01:26:16.560 movies and make it equal to the call of
01:26:19.840 the use fetch hook coming from services
01:26:22.920 use fetch to it we have to pass a
01:26:25.320 callback function in this case fetch
01:26:29.320 movies which is another one of our
01:26:31.400 functions we created and to it we can
01:26:34.280 pass a query which by default will be
01:26:37.040 set to an empty string let me actually
01:26:39.719 put this into multiple lines so you can
01:26:41.360 better see what's happening there we go
01:26:44.080 so we're calling the use fetch hook and
01:26:47.159 to it we're passing a callback function
01:26:50.119 called Fetch movies to which we pass the
01:26:53.119 query this this query right now is empty
01:26:56.040 but later on once we Implement search or
01:26:58.280 once we navigate to the search page we
01:27:00.080 can fill in the query data but it
01:27:02.320 doesn't matter if it's empty right now
01:27:04.040 because you know what happens fetch
01:27:06.119 movies if a query doesn't exist Returns
01:27:08.960 the most popular movies so we're still
01:27:11.920 good now alongside the movies themselves
01:27:15.679 back from the use fetch hook we're also
01:27:17.880 getting the loading which I can rename
01:27:20.400 to movies loading and we're also getting
01:27:23.520 back the error state which I can rename
01:27:26.080 to movies error and just so it's easier
01:27:29.199 to read it I'll put it into multiple
01:27:31.239 lines and there we go all the data we
01:27:33.719 need nicely contained within a single
01:27:36.080 call so let's put it to use right below
01:27:39.560 the icons logo we can check whether
01:27:42.080 we're currently loading the movies so if
01:27:44.639 movies loading in that case we can show
01:27:48.239 an
01:27:49.239 activity indicator built right into
01:27:52.360 react native it is a self- closing
01:27:54.880 component for which you can Define the
01:27:56.920 size in this case I'll make it large the
01:28:00.119 color which I'll set to Hash
01:28:02.560 0 FF and you can also Define the class
01:28:06.280 name which I'll set to margin top of 10
01:28:09.320 and self Center but if we're not loading
01:28:13.080 the movies then maybe there's an error
01:28:16.080 so let's check if movies errors exist
01:28:19.440 then we will render a piece of text
01:28:22.480 that'll say something like
01:28:24.760 error is equal
01:28:26.800 to movies error question mark.
01:28:31.280 message and finally if we're not loading
01:28:34.679 and we don't have an error we can return
01:28:37.600 a view within which we'll have the
01:28:40.080 search bar and the rest of the content
01:28:42.239 so basically I can just copy this view
01:28:44.360 that we had before and put it right here
01:28:47.119 instead of this view that I created next
01:28:49.840 below the search bar we can create an
01:28:51.840 empty react fragment and within it we
01:28:54.800 can display a piece of text that'll say
01:28:58.199 something like latest movies to be able
01:29:01.760 to see that text let's give it a class
01:29:04.159 name of text- LG text- white font Das
01:29:10.719 bold margin top of five and margin
01:29:14.360 bottom of three and I'll try to reload
01:29:17.040 the application just to see whether the
01:29:18.719 changes happen there we go you can see
01:29:20.719 the latest movies right there sometimes
01:29:22.679 you have to manually restart it now get
01:29:24.719 ready to use one of the most important
01:29:27.239 react native components called a flat
01:29:31.400 list imported from react native and let
01:29:34.639 me show you how it works a pretty cool
01:29:37.080 thing about the flat list is is that it
01:29:39.400 accepts a lot of props so for it to work
01:29:42.480 you don't have to customize it that much
01:29:44.840 outside of figuring out which props to
01:29:47.119 provide first of all we have to provide
01:29:49.560 the data prop that will simply be equal
01:29:52.400 to movies that's the data data we
01:29:54.480 rendering and then we have to tell it
01:29:57.080 how it will render each item each one of
01:29:59.880 these movies first we can destructure
01:30:02.719 that item which is a movie itself and
01:30:05.159 then for each item we can have an
01:30:07.280 immediate return what does an immediate
01:30:09.440 return mean well it means that we're not
01:30:11.520 opening up a function block here with
01:30:13.639 curly braces instead we're opening it
01:30:16.080 with parenthesis so whatever we put in
01:30:18.320 here such as maybe a text element means
01:30:22.040 that we will automatically return it so
01:30:24.520 for each movie Let's automatically
01:30:26.679 render an item. tile and give it a class
01:30:30.199 name of text- white as well as text- smm
01:30:35.199 so take a look at that we get back a
01:30:37.960 list of 20 most popular movies at the
01:30:40.560 time of the recording pretty cool right
01:30:42.560 another thing we have to pass into the
01:30:43.960 flat list is the key
01:30:46.480 extractor which simply helps react
01:30:48.679 native figure out how many elements they
01:30:50.480 are and where they're positioned so same
01:30:53.360 as before we get access to the item and
01:30:56.400 we simply want to take the ID of each
01:30:58.880 one of these
01:30:59.920 movies next we can Define the number of
01:31:02.639 columns in this case let's make it equal
01:31:04.719 to three and then you might need to
01:31:06.480 reload for the changes to take effect
01:31:08.400 because you cannot change the number of
01:31:09.840 columns on the Fly there we go so now
01:31:12.800 they're showing in three different
01:31:14.000 columns let's also Define a column
01:31:17.119 wrapper Style by making it into an
01:31:20.880 object and passing a justifi content of
01:31:24.480 flex Das
01:31:26.199 start gap of 20 in between the elements
01:31:30.119 padding of right five margin bottom of
01:31:36.360 10 so now if we save this they're going
01:31:39.400 to be positioned a bit more nicely and
01:31:42.679 we can also pass a general class name to
01:31:45.199 the entire flat list as margin top of
01:31:48.440 two and padding bottom of
01:31:51.880 32 Also let's say scroll enabled is set
01:31:55.480 to false as our entire view already
01:31:58.199 Scrolls by itself perfect so now we're
01:32:01.880 displaying 20 of the most popular movies
01:32:04.800 in the world just by passing the movies
01:32:06.960 array as data into the flat list pretty
01:32:10.520 cool right and I think you can now get
01:32:13.159 the idea of what I meant when I said
01:32:15.520 that the flat list is super extensible
01:32:18.080 and you can modify everything just by
01:32:20.119 calling different props data render item
01:32:23.080 key extractor num columns whatever we
01:32:25.760 needed to present our data nicely in a
01:32:27.960 list was already there and provided to
01:32:30.360 us through the flatlist component props
01:32:33.600 and you'll find this practice pretty
01:32:35.440 commonly in react native where the
01:32:38.119 pre-built components are super
01:32:39.920 extensible you just have to figure out
01:32:41.960 which props to pass and how can you know
01:32:44.639 well you just Google it which will bring
01:32:46.840 you to the documentation page you can
01:32:49.040 check out the example and then very
01:32:51.360 quickly you'll be able to see a list of
01:32:53.520 different props that you can pass to it
01:32:55.679 and exactly what each one of these props
01:32:58.199 does pretty cool right let me Zoom this
01:33:00.320 back in right now and now that we're
01:33:02.199 fetching the data properly let's make it
01:33:04.320 look a bit more interesting of course
01:33:06.719 visuals are what's going to change the
01:33:08.480 game right now we are showing just the
01:33:10.960 title but what if we could show an image
01:33:13.960 for each one of these
01:33:15.600 movies just so we don't have to declare
01:33:17.679 it in many places we'll create a new
01:33:20.480 reusable card component for the movie so
01:33:23.360 let's create a new file in the
01:33:24.880 components folder and let's call it
01:33:27.199 moviec card. TSX run rnfe to quickly
01:33:33.119 spin up our movie card component give it
01:33:36.159 a class name equal to text- White in
01:33:39.960 text
01:33:41.320 DSM and let's call it right here instead
01:33:44.920 of this simple text element instead of
01:33:47.760 that I'll call the movie card and I'll
01:33:51.119 self-close it like this now we have a
01:33:53.480 simil problem that we had before with
01:33:55.520 the tabs layout where each movie card
01:33:58.440 now shows exactly the same data so to be
01:34:01.840 able to make it different we have to
01:34:04.119 pass the right props to it so what does
01:34:06.440 it mean in this case well we can simply
01:34:09.400 spread out all of the properties of the
01:34:12.280 item or of the movie so that way we'll
01:34:15.360 be able to extract them directly within
01:34:17.760 the movie card so let's head over into
01:34:20.920 the movie card and let's accept all of
01:34:23.440 the props that we have passed into it
01:34:26.080 such as the ID the poster undor path the
01:34:30.920 title and where am I getting all of
01:34:32.880 these from well remember we already made
01:34:35.400 a mock response before and tmdb gave us
01:34:39.040 back exactly the data that we're getting
01:34:41.480 such as the poster path overview title
01:34:44.080 and
01:34:44.880 more so let's get it vote uncore average
01:34:49.880 as well as the release
01:34:52.119 date and these will be of a type movie
01:34:56.159 which we declared before under
01:34:57.800 interfaces so we already know what each
01:35:00.280 movie has now we want to make each one
01:35:02.719 of these cards clickable because once we
01:35:05.280 click it we want to go to the movie
01:35:06.920 Details page so I'll make it into a link
01:35:10.920 and this link of course has to be
01:35:13.159 imported from Expo router it'll have an
01:35:16.280 href of for/ mov slid and as child as
01:35:22.520 child simply means that the card that is
01:35:25.000 inside of the link will actually be the
01:35:26.800 thing that's clickable in this case
01:35:29.000 we'll make it a touchable
01:35:31.480 opacity so like a card is technically a
01:35:34.800 clickable button in this case coming
01:35:36.719 from react native we can give it a class
01:35:39.280 name equal to w- 30% so each card takes
01:35:44.280 only 30% of the screen and within it
01:35:47.119 let's first render an image this image
01:35:50.159 will have a source equal to an object
01:35:54.400 where the URI is we can check if the
01:35:58.440 poster path exists if it does then we'll
01:36:02.960 set it to be equal to
01:36:05.400 https colon SL SL image.
01:36:11.080 tmdb org SLT SL
01:36:18.040 pw500 and then poster path like this
01:36:22.400 else if we don't have a poster path we
01:36:24.840 can render just the placeholder so it'll
01:36:27.560 be a string of
01:36:29.400 https
01:36:31.719 col placehold doco SL600 by
01:36:36.920 400 SL1 a1a1 a SL
01:36:45.000 f.png sorry for spelling out the entire
01:36:47.239 URL just thought it would be the
01:36:48.960 simplest way to share it with you now
01:36:50.639 reload your application and let's also
01:36:53.080 give this image a class name of
01:36:56.760 w-o
01:36:58.880 h-52 and the rounded dlg for the rounded
01:37:02.600 Corners we can also give it a resize
01:37:05.239 mode equal to cover right below that
01:37:08.040 image still within the touchable opacity
01:37:10.960 let's also render a piece of text that
01:37:13.760 will simply render the movie
01:37:16.000 title and we can give it a class name of
01:37:19.239 text DSM font D bold text - white and
01:37:24.880 margin top of two and there we go once
01:37:28.320 again you can see all of these movies
01:37:30.440 but hey where is the poster why can't we
01:37:33.320 see the images well let's first consol
01:37:36.159 log the poster path to see whether we're
01:37:39.480 getting back the Pats of those movies so
01:37:42.080 the URLs are coming back but hey where
01:37:45.080 is the poster why can't we see the
01:37:47.960 images well for the image to be
01:37:50.040 displayed we need to give it a URL which
01:37:52.880 I do believe we're getting as the titles
01:37:54.760 are here so the poster should be two but
01:37:57.800 images also need a width and a height
01:38:01.119 and I thought that I was providing a
01:38:03.280 width of 100% and a height of about 208
01:38:08.400 pixels so why is it not getting applied
01:38:11.520 well if you head over into your Tailwind
01:38:14.040 doc config.js you'll see that we're
01:38:17.119 saying that only the app folders and
01:38:19.920 files will actually include Tailwind
01:38:22.040 Styles but we we have to do the same
01:38:24.440 thing for the
01:38:26.159 components so right here as the second
01:38:28.639 part of the content I can add a second
01:38:30.880 string and say/ components and then also
01:38:34.760 Target all of the components and
01:38:37.440 immediately that will allow us to apply
01:38:40.560 Tailwind Styles within our components
01:38:42.560 folder and immediately the images will
01:38:45.560 appear so this is looking absolutely
01:38:48.880 amazing and it is so nice to be able to
01:38:52.159 scroll with my thumb across all of these
01:38:55.040 movies and since we're using touchable
01:38:57.320 opacities you can see as I hover over
01:38:59.480 them it appears as they are clickable
01:39:02.239 all of this is happening natively within
01:39:04.480 our mobile application beautiful for me
01:39:07.159 I see some of the movies that are
01:39:08.480 currently popular if you're watching
01:39:10.599 this video later on for you some
01:39:12.560 different ones might be so in the
01:39:14.280 comments down below let me know what is
01:39:16.239 the popular movie from your list that
01:39:18.080 you like and with that said we also have
01:39:20.480 one little error right here saying that
01:39:22.840 the path of movie slash is not a valid
01:39:25.920 path and it's actually pretty amazing
01:39:28.440 that react native can understand that we
01:39:30.719 don't have a movie ID path we only have
01:39:33.880 movies plural so as soon as we change it
01:39:37.239 that's working great so now that we're
01:39:40.239 showing the image and title already this
01:39:42.560 is looking amazing but we might as well
01:39:45.080 show some more information so let me
01:39:47.560 open up another view right here and give
01:39:50.320 it a class name of flex - row items Das
01:39:55.599 Center justify Das start and a gap of X
01:40:00.000 meaning horizontal only of
01:40:02.760 one within it we can display another
01:40:05.560 image but this time a much simpler one
01:40:09.000 just coming from icons which is coming
01:40:11.360 from constants do star so we want to
01:40:14.679 display the number of stars for each one
01:40:17.000 of these with a class name equal to size
01:40:22.360 is set to four and below it we can
01:40:25.320 render a piece of text that'll round up
01:40:28.280 the current score so I can use the
01:40:30.840 math.round vote
01:40:33.119 average divided by two because it goes
01:40:36.080 up to 10 we want to have it up to five
01:40:38.639 so if we do this and reload our
01:40:40.560 application the changes are still not
01:40:43.000 getting applied so sometimes you might
01:40:45.480 need to just reload your application by
01:40:47.960 pressing contrl C and then run MPX
01:40:50.840 expose start one more time and then
01:40:52.880 press R to fully reload it but why can't
01:40:56.040 we see the star yet oh it's not SRC in
01:40:58.960 react native it's Source oh it's those
01:41:02.239 little gotas right that always get you
01:41:04.480 there are some small differences between
01:41:06.239 react and react native so be careful but
01:41:09.360 thankfully there aren't many let's also
01:41:12.159 give this text a class name of text- XS
01:41:15.960 extra small text- white and font Das
01:41:20.480 bold as well as uppercase so now we can
01:41:24.199 show the rating right here below this
01:41:27.080 view let's render another
01:41:29.639 view this one will have a class name
01:41:33.320 equal to flex D row items Das Center and
01:41:37.800 justify Dash between and within it we
01:41:40.960 can render a piece of text that'll have
01:41:43.520 a class name equal to text- XS text
01:41:49.679 dl-300 font D medium and the margin top
01:41:53.679 of one and within it we can render the
01:41:56.119 release date but it'll be too long like
01:41:59.440 this so we can just split it by saying
01:42:02.760 question mark. spit based on the dashes
01:42:07.760 and we can only take the first part of
01:42:09.400 the dash which is the year we just care
01:42:11.599 about when this movie was
01:42:13.280 released and below this piece of text we
01:42:16.119 can render another that will simply say
01:42:19.639 movie and we can give it a class name
01:42:22.480 equal to
01:42:23.719 text- EXs font D medium text- light 300
01:42:29.679 and uppercase and if you save it it'll
01:42:32.440 now say movie this is cool to have later
01:42:34.679 on in case maybe some are not movies but
01:42:37.360 maybe TV shows so you can specify which
01:42:39.800 one it is but for now I will simply
01:42:42.080 comment it out and I also want to make
01:42:44.159 sure that the title takes only one row
01:42:46.599 because if it doesn't that can mess up
01:42:48.480 with the view so where we have the title
01:42:51.280 that's going to be right here under this
01:42:53.199 text property we don't have to shorten
01:42:55.159 the string react natives text element
01:42:57.960 comes with a pre-built number of lines
01:43:01.159 prop where you can say that this text
01:43:03.280 should only take one line and
01:43:05.360 immediately you can see that it is
01:43:07.199 shortened to just a single line looking
01:43:10.320 great with that in mind I invite you to
01:43:12.880 further style this card right now we're
01:43:15.239 just showing the title the profile photo
01:43:17.679 the rating and the year but as you know
01:43:19.880 we're getting back so much more data
01:43:22.199 about each one of of these movies so you
01:43:25.040 can go ahead and utilize something else
01:43:27.560 like the original language or the
01:43:30.119 popularity or even show the overview
01:43:32.560 right here so feel free to play with it
01:43:35.320 and try to further customize this card I
01:43:38.199 will suggest with simply destructuring
01:43:40.239 some more props from right here and then
01:43:42.760 using them within your jsx but don't
01:43:45.159 worry about it too much because very
01:43:46.800 soon we'll be able to show all of the
01:43:49.239 details about a movie within our movie
01:43:51.880 Details page so keeping that in mind I
01:43:54.719 am now more than happy with how our
01:43:57.239 homepage is looking and if we head back
01:43:59.599 to the index. TSX you can see that we're
01:44:02.719 fetching back all the movies but now
01:44:05.239 what we can do is for the time being
01:44:08.480 manually change the query to see whether
01:44:12.000 our function works for fetches where
01:44:14.840 we're searching for a specific movie so
01:44:17.599 if I type something like Iron Man and
01:44:20.360 click save you can see that it'll reload
01:44:23.400 and show all of the movies that match
01:44:25.800 that search term pretty cool right and
01:44:28.800 if I bring it back we're back to where
01:44:30.679 we were it's not that hard right once
01:44:33.320 you understand the basics using it the
01:44:35.400 next time will feel much easier but this
01:44:38.159 was just one example of creating a
01:44:40.840 custom hook for fetching data you can
01:44:42.880 create custom hooks for many other
01:44:44.560 things like handling forms like react
01:44:46.880 hook form managing themes or storing
01:44:49.679 data in local storage you can do
01:44:51.440 whatever you want but don't give me me
01:44:53.239 wrong you don't always need to create
01:44:55.159 your own hooks only when it really makes
01:44:57.440 sense to do so because react 19 comes
01:45:00.560 with a lot of pre-built hook like the Ed
01:45:03.480 hook yep it's only used like this and it
01:45:07.400 does some pretty cool things there's
01:45:09.159 also the use action State use form State
01:45:12.119 use transition which make working with
01:45:14.599 forms and requests much easier and I
01:45:17.480 actually explain all of these in detail
01:45:20.480 with real examples and even better
01:45:22.560 projects
01:45:23.599 within the new react native course that
01:45:26.000 I'm right now building for JS Mastery
01:45:28.800 Pro it's a new learning platform where
01:45:31.080 you can learn Lesson by lesson with real
01:45:33.520 examples and even better projects so go
01:45:36.599 ahead and check it out I'll leave the
01:45:38.119 link in the description but with that
01:45:40.320 let's go ahead and develop the search so
01:45:42.320 we no longer have to manually pass the
01:45:44.080 query right here instead we can use the
01:45:46.800 actual search page and then pass over
01:45:49.880 real values great job so far the app is
01:45:53.520 already looking amazing but now we'll
01:45:55.920 make it stand out with even better
01:46:00.159 functionalities similar to what we did
01:46:02.080 in the home screen now is the time to
01:46:04.760 develop the search screen so let's open
01:46:07.280 up our file explorer and head over into
01:46:10.080 tabs search. TSX now we could totally
01:46:14.320 just copy the entire index. TSX and just
01:46:17.679 paste it over into the search but I want
01:46:20.679 to take the time to guide you through
01:46:22.800 the the process of building it out one
01:46:24.920 more time because although it'll be very
01:46:27.719 similar there will be some differences
01:46:30.080 here and it's just a beautiful chance to
01:46:33.000 recap everything we've learned so far
01:46:35.159 just to make sure you totally get it
01:46:36.880 I've made the font a bit smaller just so
01:46:38.719 you can nicely see everything and we are
01:46:41.280 ready to get started first this view
01:46:44.840 that we're wrapping everything with will
01:46:47.159 have a class name of flex D1 and BG -
01:46:51.880 primary just so we don't have to stare
01:46:53.840 at that blank screen anymore next within
01:46:57.040 it I'll display another image which I'll
01:47:00.280 import from react native and it'll have
01:47:03.280 a source equal to images coming from
01:47:07.040 constants BG so this is our background
01:47:10.760 with a class name of flex
01:47:13.840 D1 absolute W full and Z of zero as well
01:47:19.480 as a resize mode equal to cover
01:47:23.800 similar to as on the homepage next in
01:47:26.599 this case instead of wrapping everything
01:47:29.400 with the scroll view as we did on the
01:47:31.360 index here we don't want to scroll the
01:47:33.639 entire view because the search bar
01:47:35.840 always has to remain on top so here I
01:47:39.080 will actually just render a flat list
01:47:42.239 pass the movies to it and pass the
01:47:45.119 similar render item as before where we
01:47:48.080 will destructure the each individual
01:47:50.480 movie and for each one we'll simply
01:47:53.000 render a movie card to which we will
01:47:56.320 spread the item property or in this case
01:48:00.199 the movie itself so let me put these
01:48:03.000 props in a new line so it's easier to
01:48:04.920 see and we are rendering this movie card
01:48:08.119 right here there we go now of course
01:48:10.520 where are these movies coming from well
01:48:13.080 this part we can definitely grab from
01:48:15.000 the index we're getting them by simply
01:48:17.440 calling our use fetch fetch movies this
01:48:21.199 is a custom hook we already created we
01:48:23.280 might as well grab this used router at
01:48:24.840 the top we'll surely need to use it and
01:48:27.480 I'll paste it right here at the top of
01:48:29.440 our
01:48:30.199 search make sure to also get all the
01:48:32.840 Imports such as this movie card right
01:48:35.440 here and now if we go back to the search
01:48:38.040 you'll see we have well something right
01:48:40.920 a broken layout so far next as before we
01:48:44.480 need a key extractor to let react native
01:48:47.960 which ID does each one of these elements
01:48:50.159 have and here we can just say that each
01:48:53.920 one will get it from item.
01:48:57.639 id. to string we'll also render a class
01:49:02.119 name and give it a padding X of five so
01:49:05.840 some spacing a number of columns will be
01:49:09.480 set to three as before and we have to
01:49:12.199 reload our application for the changes
01:49:14.239 to take effect there we go this is a bit
01:49:16.440 better as well as we can provide the
01:49:19.679 column wrapper style which will be an
01:49:23.159 object that will say justif a content is
01:49:25.560 equal to center a gap of 16 in between
01:49:29.520 the elements as well as a margin
01:49:32.320 vertical to create some space for the
01:49:34.520 search bar of 16 as well we can also
01:49:38.480 render the content container style as
01:49:41.880 before which will simply have a padding
01:49:44.599 bottom of something like 100 and now
01:49:48.719 bear with me before we display the
01:49:51.880 search bar at the top of the flat list
01:49:54.840 because we were able to scroll the whole
01:49:57.199 thing we didn't need to see the search
01:49:58.800 bar but in this case we'll render the
01:50:01.440 search bar as a part of the flat list so
01:50:05.840 I'll do that with yet another special
01:50:08.280 flat list prop called list Heather
01:50:12.000 component I'll open up an empty react
01:50:14.800 fragment and whatever you put within it
01:50:17.639 will be displayed at the top of our list
01:50:20.880 so let me say something like like View
01:50:24.360 and this view will have a class name of
01:50:28.840 w-o
01:50:30.960 flex-r justify Dash Center margin top of
01:50:35.119 20 and items Das Center and within it we
01:50:39.320 can display our logo that'll be an image
01:50:42.639 with a source equal to icons make sure
01:50:45.920 to import them from icons constants do
01:50:49.719 logo with a class name of W12 and h10 so
01:50:55.679 now we get the logo at the top as I
01:50:57.599 promised whatever you put within the
01:50:59.280 list header component even though it's
01:51:01.239 just a part of the flat list it'll
01:51:03.360 actually show on top as that's what this
01:51:05.400 component does rendered at the top of
01:51:07.639 all the items now below the view that's
01:51:10.920 wrapping the image we can render another
01:51:13.639 view this one will have a class name
01:51:17.440 equal to margin y of five and here we
01:51:21.719 can render the search bar coming from
01:51:24.119 components search bar and we can give it
01:51:27.119 a placeholder of something like search
01:51:30.679 movies dot dot dot there we go it
01:51:33.360 appeared right on top right below the
01:51:35.280 view we can also check whether we are
01:51:37.560 currently loading so I'll say something
01:51:39.719 like movies loading and if movies are
01:51:43.040 loading then we can show an activity
01:51:46.960 indicator with a size is equal to large
01:51:51.159 a color is equal to
01:51:54.239 000000 FF and a class name equal to
01:52:00.040 margin y of three so now we have to get
01:52:03.040 access to this movies loading and we're
01:52:05.760 getting it right here through this use
01:52:08.239 fetch call but I have to spell it
01:52:10.440 properly the L in loading is uppercased
01:52:13.800 now if we go back if you're paying close
01:52:17.040 attention you would have been able to
01:52:19.119 see the loading for a short period of
01:52:21.280 time but if we don't have a loading then
01:52:24.320 it is possible that we might have some
01:52:26.320 kind of an error so I'll say if movies
01:52:29.840 error in that case we can render just a
01:52:33.440 single piece of text that'll have a
01:52:36.199 class name of text-
01:52:40.960 r-500 padding X of five and margin y of
01:52:45.239 three and the text will say
01:52:48.639 error and then we'll render the movies
01:52:51.199 error die message no errors for now and
01:52:54.679 finally below it I'll open another
01:52:57.000 Dynamic block of code and if we're
01:52:59.760 neither loading nor there is an error
01:53:03.880 then we can take a look into the current
01:53:06.079 search term let's say that the search
01:53:08.599 term right now is hardcoded search
01:53:11.280 term. trim so we want to trim any extra
01:53:14.159 spaces and if the search query exists as
01:53:16.719 well we want to check if there are any
01:53:19.239 movies. length so movies question mark.
01:53:22.280 link length for that search term and if
01:53:25.280 that is greater than zero in that case
01:53:28.360 we can finally return a piece of text
01:53:31.520 and this piece of text will say search
01:53:35.239 results
01:53:36.880 for we can put an empty string right
01:53:39.400 here and then render another piece of
01:53:42.280 text that'll say search term and I'll
01:53:45.760 style the second piece of text by giving
01:53:47.920 it a text- accent class name and I'll
01:53:51.320 style the first piece of text text by
01:53:53.639 giving it a class name of text- excl
01:53:58.639 text- white and font Dash bolt oh and
01:54:02.159 now I see that I call this just loading
01:54:04.000 an error instead of movies errors and
01:54:05.840 movies loading so you know what it might
01:54:07.880 be just simpler to call it like that it
01:54:09.840 makes sense that we're loading the
01:54:11.400 movies so I'll just not rename the
01:54:14.679 loading in the error to loading movies
01:54:16.880 and loading error I'll just keep them as
01:54:18.679 loading and error so here I can now
01:54:21.639 change the mov loading to loading and
01:54:24.599 error to error same thing right here and
01:54:28.800 now this message right here makes sense
01:54:31.480 if there is no loading and no error and
01:54:34.880 search term exist and if movies that
01:54:37.599 length is greater than zero well then
01:54:40.079 display this piece of text so now if you
01:54:42.320 go
01:54:43.639 back you can see search results for
01:54:47.079 search term so let's make it Dynamic
01:54:50.040 right at the top of this component I'll
01:54:52.760 create another Ed State we don't need
01:54:56.079 the router in this case so let me delete
01:54:58.760 it and let me Define a use State snippet
01:55:02.679 called search query set search query at
01:55:07.000 the start equal to an empty string also
01:55:09.639 when calling these movies in this case I
01:55:12.639 want to pass a second parameter to the
01:55:15.400 use fetch function of false because in
01:55:18.960 this case we don't want to autof fetch
01:55:21.960 we just just want to let the user
01:55:23.760 actually trigger the fetch on search so
01:55:26.280 that's why we initially extended this
01:55:28.400 custom hook to allow for autof fetch
01:55:31.400 when we're on the homepage or to
01:55:33.719 disallow it when we want the user to
01:55:36.119 search First and of course we can now
01:55:38.360 put the search query to use and say give
01:55:41.400 me the movies where the query matches
01:55:44.280 the query that the user currently
01:55:45.639 searched for so now that we have access
01:55:47.719 to the search query right below we can
01:55:51.440 replace this big search term with search
01:55:54.239 query. trim and also below where we're
01:55:57.880 saying search term we can render the
01:55:59.960 actual search
01:56:01.440 query so now if I open up my keyboard by
01:56:05.079 clicking on the list and I start typing
01:56:07.880 you'll see nothing is yet changing and
01:56:10.599 that's because we haven't passed proper
01:56:12.800 values into the search bar so to the
01:56:15.000 search bar alongside the placeholder we
01:56:18.920 also have to pass the value
01:56:23.360 equal to search query as well as on
01:56:27.360 change text equal to a callback function
01:56:31.960 where we simply set query or set search
01:56:34.639 query to be equal to text that is coming
01:56:37.760 right here through props and we can set
01:56:39.960 the type of this search to a string but
01:56:43.639 as you can see the search bar is still
01:56:45.360 not accepting the value prop so let's
01:56:48.119 head into it and let's implement it I'll
01:56:50.280 simply say also accept the value
01:56:52.760 and the value will be of a type string
01:56:55.040 once you do accept it simply forward it
01:56:57.360 here value and also forward the onchange
01:57:02.360 text I believe that's how we called it
01:57:04.360 onchange text so it'll be a function
01:57:08.520 that doesn't return anything void and
01:57:12.040 now we can make that onchange text right
01:57:14.760 here instead of this dummy cack
01:57:18.679 function if we now do that looks like I
01:57:22.040 did properly defined the type here we
01:57:25.079 are getting something as the first
01:57:26.360 parameter and it is text of a type
01:57:29.719 string so if I fix that you can see that
01:57:32.920 the error goes away and now if I start
01:57:35.360 typing something like
01:57:37.760 Batman you can see that the search
01:57:39.880 results change immediately right here
01:57:42.360 below I can type Marvel that works as
01:57:45.280 well it works incredibly well and as
01:57:48.360 soon as I delete it the search results
01:57:50.760 go away great
01:57:52.719 but finally what matters most is
01:57:55.079 rendering the movies that match that
01:57:57.119 search term so I'll create a new use
01:58:01.199 effect right here below this use effect
01:58:04.719 will have a callback
01:58:06.480 function and a dependency array we want
01:58:10.000 to recall it every time that the search
01:58:12.960 query changes so I'll say if search
01:58:16.719 query. trim exists so if there is
01:58:20.520 something that the user has searched for
01:58:22.960 then await and as a return value of the
01:58:25.679 fetch we're also getting access to the
01:58:27.920 refetch function which we can rename to
01:58:31.079 load movies because that's exactly what
01:58:33.280 it does and also we get access to
01:58:36.679 reset so now if there is a search term
01:58:39.960 whenever the search query changes just
01:58:43.079 await load movies like this else simply
01:58:48.599 reset the state and since we're using a
01:58:50.840 w right here we'll have to wrap this
01:58:53.239 into an asynchronous function so I'll
01:58:56.040 say const funk and I'll make it equal to
01:58:59.679 an asynchronous function that then has
01:59:01.960 this if within it that'll look something
01:59:04.520 like this and now we can call this
01:59:06.440 function just below if I do that
01:59:09.000 initially you'll see no movies but if I
01:59:11.920 search for Iron Man you can see all the
01:59:15.719 movies that match that search term and
01:59:18.159 if you start deleting it you can see
01:59:20.159 that we get back to well I I think we
01:59:22.400 got back to whatever the letter was
01:59:24.920 there before we actually removed it so
01:59:27.360 this is the letter i movies and then
01:59:30.239 yeah if we remove it we have nothing now
01:59:32.800 there's a couple of problems with this
01:59:34.840 and that is that let's say that I want
01:59:36.400 to type a normal movie name like Iron
01:59:39.639 Man like what happened here is that the
01:59:42.800 app made a request to the API for every
01:59:46.440 single letter that I type that is a lot
01:59:52.520 of different requests and for each one
01:59:54.840 we're getting many movies but hey I just
01:59:56.920 wanted to see the ones that I get back
01:59:59.280 once I type the entire search term so to
02:00:02.599 not overload our application with too
02:00:04.840 many API requests for every single
02:00:07.400 keystroke what we need to do is
02:00:09.760 something called
02:00:11.560 debouncing we can debounce a search term
02:00:15.079 by wrapping it into a timeout function
02:00:18.599 so I'll say const timeout ID is equal to
02:00:24.840 set
02:00:26.400 timeout and then we have this function
02:00:30.000 and we can close it here as well and in
02:00:32.360 this case you don't have to call it but
02:00:34.400 we do have to give it a second parameter
02:00:36.800 which is a number of milliseconds of how
02:00:39.320 long it'll wait for the next keystroke
02:00:42.560 I'll explain what that means soon and
02:00:45.400 now we can return a callback function
02:00:48.440 where we can clear the timeout with that
02:00:52.119 specific timeout ID this is just to make
02:00:55.960 our application work more efficiently we
02:00:58.360 need to clear out all the timeouts but
02:01:01.000 with that said check this out if I type
02:01:03.920 very quickly you'll see that as long as
02:01:06.840 I continue typing no request will be
02:01:09.320 made but as soon as I stop typing for
02:01:12.760 500 milliseconds which is half a second
02:01:15.040 immediately I'll get the results this
02:01:17.000 means that a user that types fast can
02:01:19.400 only make a single request and get the
02:01:21.599 data they would usually get as well but
02:01:23.719 this time in a single request instead of
02:01:26.159 a dozen great but now what happens if I
02:01:29.920 search for something that just doesn't
02:01:32.840 exist we are left with a completely
02:01:36.119 empty screen something that you never
02:01:38.480 want to see within your application you
02:01:40.679 always want to show some kind of an
02:01:42.119 empty State and believe it or not once
02:01:45.800 again I think you can now start seeing
02:01:47.679 what I was saying from the start in
02:01:50.440 react native components there is a prop
02:01:53.599 for everything from the data render item
02:01:57.760 key extractor to defining how a header
02:02:00.239 will look like two even defining how an
02:02:03.880 empty state will look like yep list
02:02:07.760 empty state is a valid flatlist prop
02:02:11.159 that allows us to specify what the user
02:02:13.360 will see if there's nothing in the list
02:02:16.079 so I'll say if there is no
02:02:18.760 loading and if there is no error
02:02:22.760 in that case and of course if we're
02:02:25.560 empty we'll show a view with a class
02:02:29.599 name equal to margin top of 10 and
02:02:33.639 padding X of five a text
02:02:36.199 element with a class name of text-
02:02:39.599 Center and text- gray 500 and within it
02:02:44.040 we can say search
02:02:45.719 query. trim if the search query exists
02:02:49.520 will say no movies found
02:02:52.719 but if a search query doesn't exist
02:02:54.880 we'll say search for a movie and of
02:02:59.440 course if there is a loading on error
02:03:03.199 we'll just return null for the empty
02:03:06.280 list component because we want to
02:03:07.840 display something else so currently we
02:03:10.599 get no movies found and if you wanted to
02:03:14.199 you could display a nice illustration
02:03:16.480 right here and say you know go ahead and
02:03:18.960 search for something cool or here's a
02:03:21.480 movie recommendation that you might want
02:03:23.079 to watch based on your history there's a
02:03:25.480 lot of things you can do on empty States
02:03:28.040 but hopefully the users won't be staring
02:03:30.159 at this for too long as they're going to
02:03:32.239 put our search to use great so in this
02:03:35.760 lesson we recapped what it means to
02:03:38.920 create a react native screen that uses
02:03:42.199 our custom hook fetches data from a
02:03:45.040 third party
02:03:46.079 API changes it based on the search query
02:03:49.520 that the user types in using their
02:03:51.280 keyboard as well as how to debounce a
02:03:54.159 search term to optimize it further and
02:03:56.639 not make too many requests and finally
02:03:59.199 how to use a flatlist component with all
02:04:01.679 of its props to properly render the
02:04:03.800 layout doesn't get much better than this
02:04:05.960 now in the next lesson we'll bring our
02:04:08.639 app to the next level we'll Implement an
02:04:11.280 algorithm that displays trending movies
02:04:15.480 so I'm not talking popular or searched
02:04:18.800 but rather show the movies that match
02:04:22.400 what the users within our app are
02:04:25.079 searching for that can kind of give you
02:04:27.320 an idea of who your users are and how we
02:04:30.320 can further customize the app so let me
02:04:33.040 show you how to implement it in the next
02:04:36.840 lesson so hey custom algorithm right
02:04:41.320 well technically yes you'll Implement a
02:04:43.320 feature that displays the movies that
02:04:45.559 The users are searching for within the
02:04:47.480 app to be more specific the more
02:04:49.760 frequently a specific search is
02:04:51.760 performed by multiple users the higher
02:04:54.679 its trending status becomes this
02:04:57.320 requires tracking and analyzing search
02:05:00.079 patterns over time for example if many
02:05:02.840 users Search for Avengers that search
02:05:05.679 term becomes trending and to track and
02:05:08.960 analyze these searches we need a place
02:05:11.639 to store that data permanently this is
02:05:14.800 where a database comes into the picture
02:05:17.480 it keeps all the information organized
02:05:20.119 and accessible and traditionally Ally
02:05:22.360 implementing this would mean building a
02:05:24.400 full stack application you'd have to
02:05:27.119 create a server set up a database
02:05:29.800 connect them host everything together
02:05:32.800 and then integrate it into your react
02:05:34.760 native project while this approach works
02:05:38.000 it can be a lot of effort and requires
02:05:40.679 diving into backend development which is
02:05:42.960 a whole different area of expertise an
02:05:45.239 easier way to get backend functionality
02:05:47.920 without starting from scratch is using a
02:05:50.559 backend as a service platform it'll
02:05:52.599 provide you with apis and tools to let
02:05:55.079 you store your data manage off and more
02:05:58.400 without needing in-depth backend
02:06:00.040 knowledge in this course I'll use aite
02:06:03.239 because it's simple open- source and
02:06:05.559 free to use plus it'll save us from
02:06:08.040 diving head first into backend work when
02:06:10.440 we really just want to focus on making a
02:06:12.440 react native app great so click the link
02:06:14.920 in the description and create your
02:06:16.960 account and then head over to your
02:06:19.760 console if you haven't already create
02:06:22.199 your project or just head over into the
02:06:24.480 one you already created and copy its ID
02:06:27.360 back within your app head over into ourv
02:06:30.400 file and let's create our second
02:06:32.559 environment variable Expo public aight
02:06:37.239 project ID and simply paste the one you
02:06:40.280 just copied now we'll have to set up a
02:06:42.599 platform for a project in this case
02:06:45.159 aight already comes with react native so
02:06:47.880 let's select it and you'll have to
02:06:50.159 choose Android or for
02:06:52.400 iOS and give it a name I'll do JSM movie
02:06:57.119 app and as the bundle ID you can type
02:06:59.880 something like com. JSM doov app like
02:07:04.679 this and click next it'll give you some
02:07:07.440 dependencies you want to install so copy
02:07:09.880 them open up your second terminal and
02:07:12.920 paste them right here to install app
02:07:15.480 right click
02:07:16.800 next next one more time because we'll do
02:07:19.440 this together and go to the the
02:07:21.639 dashboard and now we can set up the rest
02:07:23.840 of the back end together specifically
02:07:26.040 create a database and some collections
02:07:28.239 within it so let's do that next just to
02:07:31.280 give us some extra space to work with I
02:07:33.599 have hidden my Mobile screen from here
02:07:35.280 for now and I'll create our first
02:07:37.719 database I'll call it movies and create
02:07:41.920 as soon as you create it you'll be given
02:07:43.880 a database ID copy it and store it
02:07:47.040 within your editor within the EnV file
02:07:49.760 as Expo public aite database ID next
02:07:56.280 create a new collection within that
02:07:58.320 database call it metric you'll also be
02:08:02.079 given the ID of the metric collection so
02:08:04.800 copy it and paste it as the
02:08:07.800 Expo public aight collection
02:08:12.520 ID and baste it now you'll want to
02:08:15.679 create different attributes for the
02:08:17.639 metrics
02:08:18.880 collection the first one will be a
02:08:21.840 string of search term so let's say
02:08:25.199 search term let's say that it can have
02:08:27.639 maybe 1,000 characters and let's make it
02:08:30.840 required after that we'll do an integer
02:08:33.679 of
02:08:34.760 count it won't be required and we don't
02:08:38.360 need to enter the Min and Max size but
02:08:40.920 the default can be set to zero so this
02:08:43.360 is how many times has a user searched
02:08:46.119 for each specific movie or rather for a
02:08:48.880 specific search term let's also create
02:08:50.599 another attribute of a type URL and call
02:08:54.079 it poster URL I'll make it
02:08:57.760 required so we can store the poster of
02:09:00.360 the movie that people are searching for
02:09:02.599 we can also save an integer called
02:09:05.960 moviecore
02:09:07.719 ID and I'll make it
02:09:10.639 required and finally we want to save the
02:09:13.280 title of the movie people are searching
02:09:15.599 for I'll enter the size of 1,000 better
02:09:19.040 to have more than less and I'll make it
02:09:21.000 requireed
02:09:23.199 great and now we just want to make sure
02:09:25.440 that we give this collection all the
02:09:27.400 necessary permissions to be able to
02:09:29.559 update it so head over to settings
02:09:32.360 scroll down to permissions and click any
02:09:36.159 and tick create read update and delete
02:09:39.360 this is the easiest way to do it just to
02:09:41.320 make sure that we don't have any
02:09:42.480 permission errors now we just want to
02:09:44.599 make sure that we can read any kind of
02:09:46.599 value from aight so to be able to do it
02:09:49.840 let's create a new file within
02:09:52.719 services and let's call it
02:09:56.440 aight. TS within it we'll Implement two
02:10:00.000 functions the first function will track
02:10:03.280 the
02:10:04.440 searches made by a user it'll have to
02:10:08.079 accept two different params so let's
02:10:10.480 Cote it out export
02:10:13.679 const update search count and let's make
02:10:18.559 it equal to an asynchronous function
02:10:21.320 that accepts two different props the
02:10:24.040 query of a type string so what the user
02:10:26.800 is searching for and then the first
02:10:28.920 movie that matches that search query so
02:10:32.119 I'll say movie of a type movie then we
02:10:35.320 have to perform a couple of steps we
02:10:37.920 have to call the aight API to browse the
02:10:41.719 database and check if a document already
02:10:44.320 exists for the given search term so
02:10:47.360 check if a record of that search has
02:10:52.000 already been
02:10:54.239 stored then if a document is found
02:10:57.760 simply increment the Search Count
02:11:01.760 field but if no document is
02:11:05.159 found in that case it means that it's a
02:11:07.880 new search term so we want to create a
02:11:10.159 new document in aight
02:11:12.840 database and then we want to initialize
02:11:15.400 its count to one so how would that look
02:11:17.960 in practice well something like this
02:11:20.480 first we want to check everything that
02:11:22.159 we have in our app database by saying
02:11:24.840 const result is equal to a weit and now
02:11:30.119 we have to call the aight database but
02:11:33.159 before calling it we actually have to
02:11:35.239 set it up to be able to make that call
02:11:38.440 that looks something like this we can
02:11:40.880 first Define our environment variables
02:11:43.719 by saying const database unor ID is
02:11:47.800 equal to the variable coming from
02:11:50.000 environment variables process. env. exop
02:11:55.159 public aight database ID and make sure
02:12:00.040 you don't have a typo like I do right
02:12:02.559 here and at the end of that line you can
02:12:05.440 add an exclamation mark which tells
02:12:07.480 typescript that we know that this value
02:12:09.760 will be there because it cannot know
02:12:11.719 what we have within our envs but we do
02:12:14.880 know it and I'll also create another one
02:12:18.599 const collection ID will be equal to
02:12:22.440 process. env. Expo public aight
02:12:28.159 collection
02:12:29.760 ID just like this now we can set up a
02:12:34.119 new aight client const client is equal
02:12:38.000 to new
02:12:40.239 client and make sure to import this
02:12:43.159 client coming from react native app
02:12:46.599 right and we want to call a method
02:12:48.880 called set endpoint on it to which we
02:12:51.800 want to pass the default aight endpoint
02:12:56.520 https
02:12:59.040 colon cloud.
02:13:02.079 aight.
02:13:03.960 slv1 and we want to
02:13:06.199 choose our project by passing the ID of
02:13:09.880 our project that is the process. env.
02:13:14.040 Expo public aite project ID perfect so
02:13:21.599 now we have our aight client and we are
02:13:24.360 ready to set up our database instance
02:13:27.880 belonging to that aight client by saying
02:13:30.599 cons database is equal to new
02:13:36.520 databases this is coming from aight so
02:13:39.199 make sure to import it and to it you can
02:13:41.920 pass the client that we want to
02:13:43.639 initialize this database on once you do
02:13:46.000 that we can go back to where we were
02:13:48.679 result is equal to await
02:13:52.559 database. list
02:13:56.000 documents and you want to pass in a
02:13:58.679 couple of things first is the database
02:14:01.360 ID within which we want to list the
02:14:03.719 documents then we have to specify within
02:14:06.360 which collection do we want to fetch it
02:14:08.280 collection ID and then you want to pass
02:14:11.480 the actual query so query. equal and we
02:14:16.000 want to match the search term with the
02:14:18.880 query that the user is currently passing
02:14:21.679 and of course this query is also coming
02:14:23.960 from react native aight oh and make sure
02:14:26.719 to put it within an array not within an
02:14:28.800 object because there can be multiple
02:14:30.960 queries or multiple criteria that we're
02:14:33.840 searching or listing the items by so
02:14:36.559 let's go ahead and conso log the result
02:14:39.040 and before we try to get back any result
02:14:41.679 let's make sure to reload our
02:14:43.480 application by stopping it from running
02:14:46.159 and then rerunning MPX Expo start when
02:14:49.000 you change your environment variables
02:14:50.719 you you might want to always reload it
02:14:52.679 just to make sure the changes are taken
02:14:54.280 into account so I ran the application
02:14:57.800 and now back on the search page we want
02:15:00.000 to call this update Search Count
02:15:01.920 function so let's head over into search
02:15:04.760 within tabs and I'll add it for now just
02:15:08.599 here at the top of this use effect call
02:15:11.639 the update search count and make sure to
02:15:15.000 import it from Services aight if you do
02:15:18.599 it properly and navigate over to the
02:15:21.000 search function you won't be able to see
02:15:23.199 anything yet but if you pass the search
02:15:26.920 query into the update Search Count
02:15:29.239 function as well as the movies zero so
02:15:33.000 the first movie that you get back for
02:15:34.920 that search
02:15:36.400 query you'll see that you'll get back
02:15:38.960 documents zero total zero which means
02:15:42.320 that we're successfully accessing the
02:15:44.360 app right database but there's nothing
02:15:46.760 to be fetched yet this is good this is
02:15:48.960 the only thing we wanted to see for now
02:15:50.679 and if you don't yet see it that's okay
02:15:52.719 don't worry about it now we'll actually
02:15:55.599 create our first document and then we'll
02:15:58.159 be able to fetch it so now we have to
02:16:02.000 check if a record of that search has
02:16:04.639 already been stored so I'll say if
02:16:08.199 result. documents. length is greater
02:16:12.559 than zero then we want to search for the
02:16:15.840 existing movie so con existing movie is
02:16:20.239 equal to
02:16:23.639 result. documents zero so this is the
02:16:27.400 top movie that shows for that search
02:16:29.079 term in that case we want to say await
02:16:32.840 database. update document so if the
02:16:36.240 movie already exists and we need to pass
02:16:38.478 it the database ID to be able to know
02:16:41.718 within which database to update within
02:16:44.478 which collection to update and then
02:16:46.478 finally the ID that we want to update
02:16:49.040 that's going to be existing movie do
02:16:51.398 dollar sign ID and finally what do we
02:16:54.200 want to change well we want to set the
02:16:56.359 count to be equal to existing movie.
02:17:00.519 count + one because some other user has
02:17:03.959 already searched for it before else if a
02:17:06.398 movie doesn't yet exist then we can just
02:17:08.799 create that metric by saying a wait
02:17:12.318 database. create document within our
02:17:15.959 database ID within this specific
02:17:19.558 collection ID
02:17:21.799 and we also want to give it a unique ID
02:17:24.920 so say ID and import it from react
02:17:27.879 native app right do
02:17:30.519 unique so we're now creating a new
02:17:33.439 document in our aight database that will
02:17:35.920 allow us to store the searches that
02:17:38.519 people have entered and we can then
02:17:41.280 Define an object of how that record or
02:17:44.040 document in the data base will look like
02:17:47.359 and we can say search term will be equal
02:17:50.280 to query
02:17:51.959 moviecore ID so the first movie that
02:17:54.478 shows up will be the movie. ID the count
02:17:58.200 will be set to one by default and the
02:18:00.718 poster URL of that movie will be equal
02:18:03.679 to
02:18:05.120 https col and
02:18:07.439 forward image. tmb.jpg
02:18:21.240 similar to what we did on the homepage
02:18:23.478 or rather in the movie card and we can
02:18:25.478 put all of this within a tri block
02:18:28.200 everything from where we're trying to
02:18:29.920 get this result try to do this
02:18:34.120 everything we have here so let me close
02:18:36.398 it there we go and then catch if
02:18:40.439 something goes wrong well that must mean
02:18:42.840 that we have an error so simply
02:18:45.359 console.log the error message as well as
02:18:49.000 throw the error
02:18:51.599 great so with this code we should be
02:18:53.920 successfully updating the ight database
02:18:56.200 to store the metric of what the user has
02:18:58.478 searched so let's head back over into
02:19:01.120 the search and right below where we say
02:19:04.120 await load movies that means that the
02:19:06.558 search has actually been made check if
02:19:10.120 movies question mark. length is greater
02:19:12.879 than
02:19:14.040 zero and if movies question mark. Z
02:19:19.478 exists then we can await update Search
02:19:23.840 Count pass the search query as well as
02:19:26.959 the movies zero if I zoom it out that'll
02:19:29.840 look something like this so now let me
02:19:32.519 show you how that works I'll go ahead
02:19:34.959 and search for something like Avengers
02:19:39.080 and the first movie that shows up is
02:19:40.959 Avengers Infinity War I'll search one
02:19:43.599 more time for Iron Man for example I'm
02:19:46.200 want to roll with these superhero movies
02:19:48.519 and again please let me know which
02:19:49.840 movies do you like you can let me know
02:19:51.680 in the comments below this lesson and
02:19:53.600 I'll Search for
02:19:55.399 Avengers one more time just to replicate
02:19:58.720 as if some other user has searched for
02:20:01.000 that search term as well now we can head
02:20:03.359 back over into the database head into
02:20:05.920 movies metrics oh and I don't see any
02:20:09.479 documents yet that's interesting oh
02:20:12.880 check this out missing required
02:20:14.800 attribute title so back in app right
02:20:17.800 where we're creating a new document we
02:20:19.960 want to actually pass the title equal to
02:20:22.840 movie. tile so we can store that as well
02:20:26.240 oh that was my bad but thankfully we
02:20:28.120 were getting some logs
02:20:30.000 back now if I go ahead and and restart
02:20:33.720 this search and go back and
02:20:36.120 reload immediately a new document has
02:20:39.640 been added to the database Avengers
02:20:42.680 count one with the stored poster URL the
02:20:46.319 movie ID and the title so this means
02:20:49.080 that right now this is the top searched
02:20:51.200 movie now if I go ahead and search for
02:20:53.800 something like
02:20:55.840 Avatar and reload right here check this
02:20:59.359 out in our permanent data storage we're
02:21:01.640 now getting back two different documents
02:21:04.800 and now if another user goes ahead and
02:21:06.920 searches for
02:21:08.840 Avengers oh I misspelt it that's okay
02:21:11.880 there we go now this count should update
02:21:15.560 to two oh but it didn't it is still one
02:21:19.200 but let me try one more time maybe it
02:21:21.240 didn't send out the request I'll remove
02:21:23.640 1 s Avenger and I'll re it right now to
02:21:27.479 rep. search and if I reload you can see
02:21:31.640 that even the Avenger and then Avengers
02:21:34.040 gets added so we have the count of two
02:21:37.200 if I remove it and if I search for it
02:21:39.960 one more time and
02:21:44.760 reload now we're looking at the count of
02:21:47.520 three this is great it means we're
02:21:50.000 actually storing the data of the top
02:21:52.319 trending movies that The users are
02:21:54.359 searching for within our app so in the
02:21:56.960 next lesson let's go ahead and display
02:21:59.080 them at the
02:22:01.280 top in this lesson we'll first create a
02:22:04.960 function that queries the aight database
02:22:07.800 to retrieve the top movies our users
02:22:10.200 have searched for and then we'll display
02:22:12.080 it in a cool Netflix like Carousel at
02:22:15.000 the top so first things first let's
02:22:17.479 collapse this update Search Count
02:22:19.479 function I'll zoom out a bit and right
02:22:23.479 beneath it create a new function export
02:22:27.319 const get trending movies it'll be equal
02:22:32.600 to an asynchronous function and this one
02:22:35.000 doesn't have to get any props but it'll
02:22:37.520 just return a single promise of trending
02:22:41.960 movie array just like this or undefined
02:22:46.640 in case something goes wrong so here we
02:22:48.880 can open up a try and catch
02:22:52.160 Block in the catch if there's an error
02:22:55.680 we'll simply console log that
02:22:59.000 error and return undefined but in the
02:23:02.760 try we'll actually try to list out those
02:23:05.640 documents and we have already done that
02:23:07.920 at the top of the update search count
02:23:10.200 because to update we first have to fetch
02:23:12.280 them so let me copy this starting part
02:23:16.000 and paste it here con result is equal to
02:23:19.800 a wait database. list documents database
02:23:23.720 ID collection ID and this time I'll say
02:23:27.920 query. limit to five so we only want to
02:23:31.720 get the first five elements and query.
02:23:35.200 Order descending based on the count
02:23:39.640 field so we only want to show the top
02:23:43.319 five movies that people have searched
02:23:45.319 for sorted by the count and we can say
02:23:49.640 return
02:23:51.040 result. documents just to make
02:23:53.520 typescript happy we can say as
02:23:56.160 unknown as trending movie array this way
02:24:01.439 tab script will know exactly what we're
02:24:03.399 returning next we can call this function
02:24:06.240 within our homepage so head over into
02:24:09.160 index.
02:24:10.560 TSX I'll Zoom it out once again so you
02:24:13.200 can see a bit better and right above the
02:24:16.439 first use fetch call we're going to add
02:24:19.080 the second const we know how it works
02:24:22.680 you can call it use fetch but this time
02:24:26.000 to it we're going to pass the get
02:24:29.760 trending movies instead of fetch movies
02:24:33.720 and we get back the same things the data
02:24:36.520 which this time we can rename to
02:24:38.120 trending movies the loading which we can
02:24:41.439 rename to trending loading as well as
02:24:44.399 the error which we can rename to
02:24:47.279 trending error now just below where we
02:24:50.359 we have the activity
02:24:51.920 indicator we can say if movies
02:24:54.680 loading or trending loading and same for
02:24:58.520 the error if there is movies error or if
02:25:03.120 there is trending error show an error
02:25:05.840 that error can be movies error or maybe
02:25:08.960 it is trending error question mark.
02:25:12.359 message here to the search bar we don't
02:25:15.040 have to pass the value because we're
02:25:16.560 searching within the search page so we
02:25:19.240 can make this value optional right here
02:25:22.359 and what else is optional on press
02:25:24.359 placeholder what are we missing on
02:25:27.200 change text yeah we don't need it right
02:25:29.960 here in the homepage next right below
02:25:33.160 the search bar I'll say if trending
02:25:37.160 movies exist so if trending movies then
02:25:41.560 show a
02:25:43.520 view this view will have a class name
02:25:48.000 equal to margin top of 10
02:25:51.560 and we'll render a text
02:25:54.080 element that will say trending
02:25:57.800 movies of course let's go ahead and give
02:26:00.200 it a class name so we can see it of
02:26:02.840 text- LG as well as text- white font
02:26:07.960 Dash bold and margin bottom of three
02:26:11.040 let's open up our terminal and reload
02:26:13.000 the
02:26:13.760 app just to see where we are sometimes
02:26:16.439 it gets stuck so you have to reload it
02:26:18.800 you know that by now don't you and now
02:26:20.920 you can see trending movies title right
02:26:22.880 here below the search so how are we
02:26:25.120 going to render the trending movies well
02:26:27.920 believe it or not it's going to be a new
02:26:30.520 flat list to which we can pass the
02:26:32.920 trending
02:26:34.240 movies as the data and I'll pass the
02:26:38.319 render item to be equal to as before
02:26:41.960 we'll destructure the item as well as
02:26:44.960 the index from this function and then
02:26:47.319 for each item for now I'll s simply
02:26:50.680 return the item. tile but of course we
02:26:54.000 have to put it within a text so let me
02:26:56.040 actually expand this and return a text
02:26:59.240 element within which I'll render the
02:27:02.120 item.
02:27:03.439 tile and let's give it a class name
02:27:06.600 equal to text- White text DSM just so we
02:27:11.640 can see it now if we properly close this
02:27:14.439 flat list you'll be able to see three
02:27:17.200 top movies Avengers Infinity war three
02:27:19.920 times let's style it a bit by giving it
02:27:22.479 a class name of margin bottom of four
02:27:25.920 and margin top of three and I'll put
02:27:28.439 each one of these props in a new line
02:27:30.520 just so it's easier to see what's
02:27:31.960 happening there we go data render item
02:27:36.680 and then we render a text below render
02:27:39.120 item we'll have the key extractor it is
02:27:41.960 a mandatory thing where we get access to
02:27:45.040 the item and the ID will be coming from
02:27:49.080 item do movor id. TW string and
02:27:54.000 currently the top three movies all seem
02:27:56.439 to be Avengers Infinity War I guess
02:27:58.920 that's because for all three of these it
02:28:01.319 saved that as the title let me actually
02:28:03.319 delete those documents and let's try it
02:28:05.800 one more time now there should be no
02:28:08.359 latest
02:28:09.359 movies so now if I reload my application
02:28:12.720 once again right off the bat you'll see
02:28:15.000 an error right here saying that
02:28:17.200 virtualized lists should never be nested
02:28:19.840 into inside plain scroll views with the
02:28:22.520 same orientation because it can break
02:28:25.240 windowing and other functionality what
02:28:27.640 this means is that we cannot have at
02:28:29.760 least not the list with the same
02:28:32.479 orientation but don't worry about that
02:28:34.520 for now because very soon we'll change
02:28:36.680 the orientation of this flat list to
02:28:38.760 horizontal because that'll make it look
02:28:40.760 more like this so for now if I go back
02:28:43.200 to my app go to search and try with
02:28:46.960 something like Avatar and then I delete
02:28:50.240 that and maybe search for alien okay and
02:28:53.399 now if I go back to aight looks like the
02:28:56.160 metrics are not getting added so let's
02:28:58.520 debug it together I love it when
02:29:00.840 something obvious doesn't work when I'm
02:29:02.560 recording because it gives me the
02:29:04.200 opportunity to go back into the code and
02:29:06.680 I think that sometimes you can learn
02:29:08.080 more that way than just watching me code
02:29:10.439 everything out because you can see
02:29:12.399 exactly how I would approach the
02:29:14.680 debugging process first we have to ask
02:29:17.120 ourselves where is the error coming from
02:29:19.800 in this case we know that the documents
02:29:21.640 are not getting added to the ight
02:29:23.240 database so we have to ask ourselves
02:29:25.399 where is that within our code and that
02:29:28.000 is within the search page so if you head
02:29:30.160 over to the search page you'll see that
02:29:32.200 we have a single use effect now within
02:29:35.240 this use effect we have both await load
02:29:37.960 movies as well as update search count
02:29:41.160 and these two can race together and we
02:29:43.720 never get back the meaningful results so
02:29:45.880 we have to split them into two separate
02:29:48.080 use effects so I'll I'll copy this if
02:29:51.120 statement and within this first use
02:29:53.640 effect that gets executed whenever the
02:29:55.720 search query gets changed here we just
02:29:58.680 want to await load
02:30:00.560 movies but in the second one that I'll
02:30:03.600 create right now use effect where we
02:30:06.399 have a callback function this one will
02:30:09.319 change whenever the movies themselves
02:30:12.760 change and here we want to check if
02:30:15.840 movies do length is greater than zero
02:30:18.359 and if movie first EX exists then we
02:30:21.000 want to open up a codee block here and
02:30:23.319 we can simply call the update Search
02:30:25.439 Count without the use effect like this
02:30:28.080 now if we go ahead and search for
02:30:30.920 something like Avatar we'll get back the
02:30:33.359 movies I'll go ahead and search for
02:30:35.720 something like let's do
02:30:39.120 cats there we go and if I head back to
02:30:42.080 aight you'll see that we have two
02:30:44.279 different movies stored right here we
02:30:46.439 might as well go for the third one so
02:30:48.680 I'll go with iron
02:30:51.600 man there we go looking good and if I
02:30:56.200 reload it gets saved and of course what
02:30:58.960 we care about is what if another user
02:31:01.279 searches for a similar movie so if
02:31:03.720 another user searches for avatar for
02:31:06.399 example there we go does the count get
02:31:10.000 updated and this time it does so now if
02:31:13.960 we go back to the homepage and head back
02:31:16.439 over here where we're trying to show a
02:31:19.000 flat list of the top movies let me just
02:31:22.600 make sure to reload the page you can see
02:31:24.800 that right here we get three different
02:31:27.160 movies Avatar cats and Iron Man which is
02:31:30.080 great that means that our trending
02:31:32.040 functionality is kind of working but of
02:31:34.640 course we have to improve it further
02:31:36.840 check this out we can pass just a single
02:31:39.359 prop called horizontal and if you just
02:31:42.520 pass it like this and save it
02:31:45.279 immediately the orientation will change
02:31:47.960 to horizontal we can also O Say shows
02:31:51.319 horizontal scroll indicator and set it
02:31:53.800 to false and we can also render the item
02:31:57.080 separator
02:31:58.240 component and I'll make it equal to a
02:32:01.160 simple
02:32:02.479 view that is
02:32:04.479 self-closing and has a class name equal
02:32:07.840 to W of 4 now we can see that this looks
02:32:10.720 a bit better oh and this latest movies
02:32:12.880 was supposed to be just above the other
02:32:15.200 flat list not this one so I'll go below
02:32:18.000 this one and here I can paste it it says
02:32:21.000 latest movies and right here at the top
02:32:23.200 we have trending
02:32:24.880 movies great but of course we don't just
02:32:28.000 want to show three pieces of text we
02:32:30.200 want to show fullon cards that look like
02:32:32.840 this with these top trending numbers so
02:32:35.920 to do that let's create a new component
02:32:38.479 in the components folder and let me call
02:32:41.520 it trending
02:32:44.680 card. TSX run rnf to quickly create and
02:32:50.279 now instead of this text where we're
02:32:53.439 rendering the item title we can render
02:32:56.080 the trending card just like this a
02:32:58.359 self-closing trending card component to
02:33:01.520 which we can pass over the movie equal
02:33:04.479 to item this is an alternative way of
02:33:07.200 just spreading everything out sometimes
02:33:09.640 this is preferable because then you can
02:33:11.479 consol Lo the entire movie itself and
02:33:13.840 then know what properties does it have
02:33:15.960 and let's also pass the index of that
02:33:17.960 movie equal to index so we can show that
02:33:20.800 number now let's head over into the
02:33:23.240 trending card and let's get it
02:33:24.800 implemented as with the cards before
02:33:27.040 I'll wrap this card with a link because
02:33:29.479 we want to make sure that the entire
02:33:30.880 card is clickable and that it leads to
02:33:33.160 the movie Details page so I'll add an
02:33:35.840 href of SL movies SL movor ID and I'll
02:33:42.800 say as child because we want the entire
02:33:45.439 touchable opacity to be clickable so
02:33:48.000 it'll inherit link properties now where
02:33:50.680 is this movie ID coming from well we can
02:33:53.520 destructure the movie right here from
02:33:56.359 props and from the movie we can further
02:33:59.120 destructure the movie ID the title and
02:34:02.720 the poster URL and outside of this movie
02:34:06.359 destructuring we can also get the index
02:34:09.319 and we can say that all of these are of
02:34:11.279 a type trending card props now within
02:34:15.720 each link let's render a touchable
02:34:18.359 opacity it'll have a class name equal to
02:34:22.960 w-32 relative and padding left of five
02:34:26.800 and immediately within it we can render
02:34:29.120 an image this image will have a source
02:34:32.960 equal to URI is poster _ URL a class
02:34:37.560 name equal to
02:34:39.600 w32 h48 and rounded
02:34:44.080 dlg with a resize mode equal to cover
02:34:48.800 and there we go now you can see the
02:34:51.359 cover photos or the posters for the top
02:34:53.960 three searched movies right below it
02:34:56.120 I'll render another view and this view
02:34:59.279 will be absolutely positioned so I'll
02:35:01.880 give it a class name of absolute that's
02:35:04.560 because it'll serve as an overlay over
02:35:06.920 the poster so somewhere at the bottom
02:35:09.359 left we want to show that number 1 2 3
02:35:12.359 so I'll say bottom
02:35:14.439 D9 minus left-
02:35:17.920 3.5 padding X of to padding y of one and
02:35:22.720 the rounded -4 and now within it we want
02:35:25.520 to achieve some kind of a masked layout
02:35:27.760 I'm not sure if you can see it here but
02:35:29.680 the number here will be a bit masked
02:35:32.040 like it is under some kind of a darker
02:35:34.160 mask like it'll have a slight gradient
02:35:37.000 and we can do that using a package
02:35:39.279 called masked view this one right here
02:35:42.120 has about 265,000 downloads and as the
02:35:46.000 package says it creates a masked view
02:35:48.439 where the text appears as a cutout over
02:35:50.760 an image so let's simply copy the
02:35:52.760 installation command that is mpm install
02:35:55.960 at reactnative mask view slask dvw while
02:36:00.520 it is installing we can put it to use
02:36:03.040 right here within this view I'll create
02:36:05.439 another masked View and you have to
02:36:08.680 provide a mask element in this case
02:36:11.479 it'll be a single piece of text so I'll
02:36:15.200 do it right
02:36:16.720 here text inside of which I'll render
02:36:19.720 index + one so that we don't start at
02:36:22.560 zero we start at one of course I'll give
02:36:24.920 this index a class name equal to font
02:36:28.000 Das bold text- white and text- 6xl we
02:36:33.040 want to make it extra large let's fix
02:36:34.920 the class name spelling right here and
02:36:37.520 within the mask view I will render the
02:36:39.640 image that will have a
02:36:41.800 source equal to images coming from
02:36:45.240 constants do ranking gradient
02:36:49.720 with a class name of
02:36:53.560 size-14 and a resize mode set to cover
02:36:58.479 now let's fix a typo where we have it
02:37:00.840 there we go I think we're good and take
02:37:04.000 a look at these numbers right here
02:37:06.319 looking good 1 two 3 and if you try
02:37:09.640 scrolling you'll see that this one has a
02:37:11.840 horizontal scroll whereas you can scroll
02:37:14.399 the entire page up and down so before we
02:37:17.319 had that virtualized list error because
02:37:19.800 we had two vertical lists in the same
02:37:22.160 file or in the same screen should I say
02:37:24.880 but now one is horizontal and one is
02:37:27.080 vertical so we're good now just below
02:37:29.720 this view not the mask view but the
02:37:31.760 other one we can render a piece of text
02:37:34.640 that will simply render the title of the
02:37:37.240 movie and it'll have a class name equal
02:37:40.720 to text DSM font Das bold margin top of
02:37:45.319 two and text- light 200 and we can also
02:37:50.520 make it take two lines maximum so number
02:37:54.439 of lines two and with that you have
02:37:57.160 implemented this trending card layout
02:37:59.680 which is looking great so if we go back
02:38:02.080 to the index no warnings or errors here
02:38:05.200 and if I go ahead and search for a new
02:38:07.399 movie like Avengers there we go and go
02:38:10.359 back to home and
02:38:12.520 reload you have to keep in mind this
02:38:14.800 search functionality update is not
02:38:16.720 something that has to happen in real
02:38:18.160 time when you open the app again you'll
02:38:20.000 be able to see all the new searches that
02:38:21.880 people have made and there we go a
02:38:23.800 fourth number appeared right here
02:38:25.760 Avengers that is perfect and the more
02:38:28.080 users search for the same movies the
02:38:30.279 higher they will rank wonderful now you
02:38:33.160 have not only implemented the typical
02:38:35.160 API fetch call but also implemented a
02:38:38.000 backend as a service tool that allowed
02:38:40.520 us to store a persistent data within a
02:38:43.600 database that we use to then show the
02:38:46.520 top trending movies great job
02:38:51.200 oh and now that everything is looking so
02:38:53.359 good we might as well make it a real
02:38:55.560 mobile app by hiding the time and the
02:38:57.800 battery percentage no need to show it
02:38:59.840 here within our movie app and even
02:39:01.600 though having it here is totally fine
02:39:04.240 having it within our movie Details page
02:39:06.399 which will will code next is not ideal
02:39:08.960 because if the poster is very light or
02:39:11.479 very dark depending on your theme these
02:39:13.640 numbers will not be visible at all and
02:39:16.040 they will just clutter the poster image
02:39:18.200 so to hide them you you can head over
02:39:20.200 into our appcore layout it is this
02:39:24.319 layout right here the primary one not
02:39:26.560 the tabs one and right below the stack
02:39:29.080 you can say status bar import from react
02:39:31.600 native and simply give it a hidden
02:39:34.800 property set to true if you save it and
02:39:38.920 open up your terminal you'll see that
02:39:41.000 the layout children must be of type
02:39:43.000 screen and all other children are
02:39:45.200 ignored that's why this status bar is
02:39:47.319 not taking effect so what you have to do
02:39:49.680 instead is wrap everything with an empty
02:39:52.880 react fragment just like this and then
02:39:56.840 right next to the stack or on top of it
02:39:59.800 in other words you can save it and there
02:40:02.240 we go it gets hidden away immediately
02:40:04.840 the app looks so much cleaner as the
02:40:07.080 time and Battery are not impacting our
02:40:09.200 view looking great and all of these are
02:40:12.680 just fundamentals of react native
02:40:15.120 everything from Flat lists to layouts to
02:40:18.240 knowing how to hide thisp status bar if
02:40:19.920 you need to but this is just the
02:40:21.560 beginning there's always more to learn
02:40:23.920 bigger projects to build and exciting
02:40:25.960 things to ship to production so if you
02:40:27.680 want to apply some of the knowledge
02:40:28.960 you've gotten today to practical
02:40:30.960 production level check out JS Mastery
02:40:33.399 Pro where I dive deeper into JavaScript
02:40:36.200 react react native nygs and more and the
02:40:39.600 best part is that it is a subscription
02:40:41.760 based model which means that it is more
02:40:43.920 accessible to get started and you can
02:40:46.319 always learn something new every month
02:40:48.560 so I'll see in there as it is the new
02:40:51.439 biggest chapter of JavaScript Mastery
02:40:53.760 but with that said I do want to give you
02:40:55.880 a glimpse of the kind of optimizations
02:40:59.000 that we do on the production level so in
02:41:01.560 the next lesson I'll show you one big
02:41:03.840 mistake that we've made in our hom page
02:41:06.279 yep it is hidden right here within this
02:41:08.319 file but understanding it requires
02:41:10.760 reading a lot of docs and fixing it well
02:41:13.920 I'll show you how to do it in the next
02:41:16.720 lesson but just before I show you how to
02:41:19.479 tweak that little homepage optimization
02:41:21.920 I want to make sure that we focus on the
02:41:23.920 movie Details page we've been staring at
02:41:26.760 the search results and the homepage for
02:41:28.840 such a long time even the trending
02:41:30.680 movies right now but we were never able
02:41:33.080 to fetch and show all the movie details
02:41:36.080 so let's do that next first we have to
02:41:38.479 create a function to gather all the
02:41:40.560 movie information so head over into
02:41:44.359 Services api. TS and right below fetch
02:41:48.800 movies we want to create a new function
02:41:51.880 export const fetch movie details it'll
02:41:57.040 be equal to an asynchronous function
02:41:59.439 that simply accepts a movie ID of a type
02:42:02.960 string which will return a promise
02:42:05.359 that'll ultimately resolve into movie
02:42:08.640 details and now we can open up the
02:42:10.479 function block I'll open up a try and
02:42:13.399 catch Block in the catch you know the
02:42:16.319 drill if there is an error simply con to
02:42:19.359 log that error and throw it just so we
02:42:22.920 can catch it somewhere else and in the
02:42:25.000 try we can make a fetch request similar
02:42:27.640 to the one we made above but this time
02:42:29.600 to a different endpoint so let's say con
02:42:32.439 response is equal to a wait Fetch and
02:42:37.399 now we can form the URL by first getting
02:42:40.279 to the tmdb
02:42:43.000 config Bas
02:42:45.120 URL
02:42:47.080 slov slash movie ID question mark API
02:42:52.640 key is equal to tmdb config API key so
02:42:58.640 we have just crafted the endpoint which
02:43:00.800 we want to call as the second parameter
02:43:02.960 we want to provide it an object where
02:43:05.920 the method will be set to get and the
02:43:09.000 headers will be set to tmdb config do
02:43:13.399 headers we already prepped everything
02:43:16.359 beforehand finally if the response is is
02:43:19.640 not okay we simply want to throw a new
02:43:23.880 error saying something like failed to
02:43:27.080 fetch movies or movie details that's a
02:43:30.960 bit more precise but if response is okay
02:43:34.800 we want to get the data by awaiting the
02:43:37.960 response. Json typically when you use
02:43:40.760 fetch you need to say response. Json to
02:43:43.160 extract the data and finally we want to
02:43:45.840 return the data which in this case is
02:43:48.640 the move
02:43:49.720 details so now that we have created this
02:43:52.120 function let's head over into the page
02:43:54.840 that we haven't touched so far which is
02:43:57.200 this one movies ID a dynamic route that
02:44:02.120 displays the details of that specific
02:44:04.240 movie let's start with the jsx we're
02:44:06.960 wrapping everything with a view that has
02:44:09.359 a class name equal to BG primary and
02:44:14.200 flex das1 if I save it how do we get to
02:44:17.399 that page well you just have to click on
02:44:20.319 one of the touchable opacities or one of
02:44:22.520 the buttons so choose whichever one you
02:44:25.399 want I'll go with the
02:44:27.240 Gladiator and now we can render the
02:44:29.279 movie details I'll render them within a
02:44:31.479 scroll view because it is possible that
02:44:34.160 the height of the details will span more
02:44:36.880 than the height of the device and I'll
02:44:38.840 give it a Content container style equal
02:44:42.359 to padding bottom of 80 within it I'll
02:44:46.439 display a view and within that view I'll
02:44:49.120 display an image that'll have a source
02:44:51.880 equal to URI and we once again have to
02:44:55.399 have that starting part of a photo https
02:45:00.600 colon image.
02:45:03.680 tmdb org SLT SL
02:45:08.479 w500 and then we render the Movie
02:45:11.439 question mark. poster path but of course
02:45:14.960 we first have to fetch the movie details
02:45:17.319 so this is exactly where that function
02:45:19.080 we just created comes into the picture
02:45:20.920 first we need to get the ID of the movie
02:45:23.399 that we're trying to get the details for
02:45:25.760 and we can do that by destructuring the
02:45:28.560 ID by using the use local search for
02:45:32.359 Rams Hook Once We have the ID it is
02:45:34.800 pretty simple we just say const the
02:45:38.240 structure the data rename it as
02:45:41.720 movie also accept the loading and make
02:45:45.040 it equal to the use fetch hook call
02:45:48.160 within which we can have a callback
02:45:50.399 function that then calls the fetch movie
02:45:54.439 details and we need to pass the ID as
02:45:57.920 string right into it so now we get
02:46:00.800 access to that movie and if you click on
02:46:03.319 one of those
02:46:05.760 movies you can see that we get
02:46:07.800 redirected we no longer have an error
02:46:10.439 but to be able to see the poster we have
02:46:12.760 to give this image a class name of w
02:46:16.880 fool and let's do something big like H
02:46:20.760 550 pixels there we go so now it takes
02:46:24.800 that upper part of the screen looking
02:46:27.520 good we can also give it a resize mode
02:46:31.200 equal to
02:46:32.840 stretch there we go so now it is looking
02:46:35.760 even better now below that view we can
02:46:38.399 render another view that'll have a class
02:46:41.760 name equal to
02:46:44.319 flex-all items Das start justify Dash
02:46:48.279 Center margin top of five and padding X
02:46:51.520 of five we're just creating some space
02:46:54.000 for the text elements that'll go within
02:46:55.760 it so let's create the space for the
02:46:58.439 first text element that'll render the
02:47:01.680 Movie question mark. tile and we can
02:47:05.000 style it by giving it a class name equal
02:47:08.760 to text- White font Das bold and text-
02:47:14.399 excl there we go Gladiator 2 we can go
02:47:18.520 below
02:47:19.399 this text and render another view this
02:47:23.040 view will have a class name equal to
02:47:26.520 flex Das row items Das Center and a gap
02:47:31.279 X of one in between the elements as well
02:47:34.040 as a margin top of two to divide it a
02:47:36.560 bit from the elements above within this
02:47:39.279 view we can show one more
02:47:42.279 text this one will have a class name
02:47:45.359 equal to text- light 200
02:47:49.840 and text- smm and within it we can
02:47:53.040 render the year we already learned how
02:47:54.880 to do that movie question mark. releasor
02:47:58.760 date question mark
02:48:00.960 do split by the dash and get only the
02:48:05.800 year oh but the index of zero has to
02:48:08.560 come after the split there we go 2024
02:48:12.080 right below this text we can render
02:48:14.160 another text with the same Styles so
02:48:17.200 that'll be a class name of of text-
02:48:20.319 light 200 and text- smm and within this
02:48:25.600 one we can render the Movie question
02:48:28.000 mark.
02:48:29.680 runtime so this one lasts for
02:48:32.960 184 and we can add M at the end which
02:48:35.880 stands for minutes now we can exit this
02:48:38.840 View and we can create another view
02:48:40.880 below to show some more
02:48:42.960 information this one will have a class
02:48:45.640 name equal to flex-r
02:48:49.080 items Das
02:48:50.439 Center BG of dark 100 padding X of two
02:48:55.800 padding y of 1 rounded -
02:48:59.920 MD Gap X of one and a margin top of two
02:49:04.960 and within this view we can render an
02:49:07.240 image that'll have a source equal to
02:49:11.080 icons coming from constants icons do
02:49:15.000 star as well as a class name equal to s
02:49:18.760 size of
02:49:19.840 four and there we have it one little
02:49:22.359 star right there right below that image
02:49:25.520 we can render a piece of text that'll
02:49:28.000 have a class name equal to text- White
02:49:32.560 font Das bold and text- smm and within
02:49:37.359 it I'll put a dynamic block of code and
02:49:40.960 round up the current score by saying
02:49:44.479 math.round movie mark. Vore average
02:49:49.800 or if it doesn't exist simply take zero
02:49:53.319 just so it doesn't break and we can say
02:49:55.359 out of 10 so this one is 7 out of 10
02:49:59.080 right below it we can also render
02:50:01.080 another piece of
02:50:02.439 text that will have a class name that'll
02:50:06.120 have a text- light 200 and text- smm and
02:50:11.239 within this one we want to show the
02:50:13.040 number of votes so in parenthesis I'll
02:50:16.520 say movie question mark. vote count and
02:50:21.239 then I'll say votes so this one got
02:50:26.279 2,947 votes it matters right we want to
02:50:29.720 know how many people have rated it on
02:50:31.680 average 7 out of 10 and now we want to
02:50:34.080 show a couple of these movie labels like
02:50:36.800 the overview release date status genres
02:50:39.800 and so on each one has a little title on
02:50:42.720 top and then the actual
02:50:44.920 content that means that we can turn it
02:50:47.160 into a reusable component
02:50:49.399 so right at the top I'll create a new
02:50:52.479 reusable component and call it movie
02:50:56.200 info so const movie info is equal to a
02:51:00.120 function that will destructure the props
02:51:03.800 of label and value so for each value
02:51:06.960 there is a label they'll be of a type
02:51:10.359 movie info props which we can Define
02:51:14.080 just above by saying
02:51:17.040 interface movie info props and it has a
02:51:21.399 label of a type string as well as an
02:51:24.080 optional value of a type either string
02:51:27.520 or number or null perfect and then we
02:51:32.800 can open up a function block with an
02:51:35.239 immediate return which means that we
02:51:37.080 just put parenthesis right here and not
02:51:38.960 curly braces so what do we return well
02:51:42.920 it'll be a
02:51:44.239 view with a class name of flex-all
02:51:49.279 items Das start justify Das Center and a
02:51:54.279 margin top of five and right within it
02:51:57.359 first we show a piece of
02:51:59.680 text that has a class name of text
02:52:04.840 dl-200 font
02:52:07.920 dormal and text
02:52:10.520 DSM and within it we render the label
02:52:14.200 and next we can have a text just beneath
02:52:16.960 it with a class name of text- light-1
02:52:22.520 100
02:52:24.680 f-bold text DSM and margin top of two
02:52:29.319 and within it we render either the value
02:52:32.120 or a string of Na a value doesn't exist
02:52:37.000 and now we can use this movie info a
02:52:39.680 couple of times right here below our
02:52:42.600 view that contains the vote count so
02:52:45.640 let's go right below it and let's render
02:52:48.040 a couple of these movie info
02:52:51.680 components the first one will have a
02:52:53.840 label of overview and the value of movie
02:52:58.080 mark. overview and if you self close it
02:53:02.040 check this out immediately it looks
02:53:04.600 super nice let's also render one more
02:53:07.600 just beneath it this one will have a
02:53:10.239 movie info of jras and the value will be
02:53:14.800 movie mark.
02:53:17.439 genres question mark. map where we get
02:53:20.800 each individual G as in genre and then
02:53:23.720 we can say return g.n name and then
02:53:26.800 outside of that function we can say do
02:53:28.960 join them with something like a dash in
02:53:32.000 between like this or say na doesn't
02:53:36.000 exist so if you do this you'll see
02:53:38.439 action adventure drama looking good now
02:53:42.319 let's create one more view below this
02:53:45.200 movie info this one will have a class
02:53:48.160 named name of flex Flex D
02:53:52.560 row justify Dash between and a w of 1
02:53:57.239 over two so that is 50% of the width and
02:54:00.680 within it I'll show another movie info
02:54:03.120 component with a label of budget and a
02:54:06.800 value of dollar sign movie question
02:54:10.680 mark. budget and we can divide it by 1
02:54:15.840 million and then render the data in
02:54:18.600 Millions that'll look something like
02:54:20.720 this budget is 310 million for this
02:54:25.120 movie still within the same view but
02:54:27.640 just below this movie info we can also
02:54:30.080 show the revenue so the label of Revenue
02:54:33.640 and a value of we want to do the same
02:54:36.560 thing right here but we can round it up
02:54:38.279 a bit so we can say a template string of
02:54:41.560 math.
02:54:43.279 round movie question mark. revenue and
02:54:48.080 one once again we want to divide it by 1
02:54:50.560 million and save it and at the start we
02:54:53.800 can add a dollar sign as well right here
02:54:57.840 so now we can see that the revenue is
02:55:00.279 458 million which means that this movie
02:55:03.239 is already profitable finally we can go
02:55:05.800 below this view that wraps the two of
02:55:07.880 them and we can create one more movie
02:55:12.000 info this one will have the label of
02:55:15.239 production
02:55:17.120 companies and and it'll have a value
02:55:20.120 equal to movie question mark.
02:55:23.319 production
02:55:24.840 companies. map where we get each
02:55:27.560 individual company and for each one we
02:55:30.720 return its name and we can join them by
02:55:34.640 a dash which will look something like
02:55:37.120 this or if it doesn't exist we can
02:55:40.000 simply say na a there we go so now we
02:55:43.040 can see Paramount Pictures scotf free
02:55:45.319 production and more many people worked
02:55:47.840 on this movie movie finally just below
02:55:50.200 this entire scroll View at the bottom we
02:55:52.840 can render a touchable opacity a button
02:55:56.319 to go back to the previous page so it'll
02:55:59.880 have an
02:56:01.600 image that'll have a source equal to
02:56:05.160 icons.
02:56:06.720 arrow with a class name equal to
02:56:10.880 size-5 margin right of one margin top of
02:56:15.560 0.5 and rotate 180
02:56:18.840 and a tint color equal to # FFF so if
02:56:24.000 you render it you can't see it just yet
02:56:26.760 but below it I'll render a text that'll
02:56:30.399 say go
02:56:32.800 back and I'll give it a class
02:56:35.760 name equal to text- White font D
02:56:41.279 semibold
02:56:43.720 text-base and now you can see it but of
02:56:46.439 course we have to style this touchable
02:56:47.960 opat capacity a bit better by giving it
02:56:50.920 a class name of
02:56:53.920 absolute
02:56:56.279 bottom-5 left- 0 right- Z margin X of
02:57:03.279 five BG of
02:57:05.800 accent rounded
02:57:08.920 dlg padding y of
02:57:12.720 3.5
02:57:14.520 Flex Flex Das row items Das Center
02:57:19.479 justify Dash
02:57:20.840 Center and a z of 50 so it appears above
02:57:24.640 other elements and there you have it a
02:57:28.000 movie Details page with a Gob back
02:57:31.040 button of course to actually make it
02:57:33.560 work we can use the router
02:57:35.760 functionalities so let me give it an
02:57:38.200 onpress and call the
02:57:40.600 router which we can import from Expo
02:57:43.640 router dot back if you save it and click
02:57:47.800 go back back take a look at that it
02:57:50.120 actually goes back but you can also just
02:57:53.000 scroll or swipe from left to right on
02:57:56.479 iOS to go back as well and now you can
02:58:00.160 see the movie details for all of these
02:58:03.160 different movies not only the popular
02:58:05.520 ones or the trending ones but also the
02:58:08.520 ones that you search for so if you have
02:58:10.720 your favorite
02:58:12.600 movie I don't know which one it is once
02:58:15.080 again let me know down in the comments
02:58:17.399 well you can find it right here and see
02:58:19.760 all of its
02:58:20.920 details and I got to say the app is
02:58:24.000 super super responsive it works very
02:58:27.560 well and you can see as I swipe up and
02:58:30.040 down and as I open different pages it is
02:58:32.720 just super efficient and this brings us
02:58:36.200 to the end of the movie Details page and
02:58:39.439 we're almost done with the entire app
02:58:41.680 this is pretty amazing I got to say just
02:58:44.920 before we finish it off I want to make
02:58:46.680 sure that we have something on the saved
02:58:48.800 and profile Pages too because right now
02:58:51.560 they look super blank so let's head over
02:58:54.600 into those two pages starting with a
02:58:57.359 profile and I'll just tighten them up a
02:58:59.640 bit so we have a nice blank screen but
02:59:02.520 then if you want to you can go ahead and
02:59:04.760 Implement additional
02:59:06.560 functionalities this is an exercise for
02:59:09.520 you to improve this app even further and
02:59:12.920 to put the skills you've gained from
02:59:14.880 this video to the test first things
02:59:17.680 first let's get rid of this ugly white
02:59:20.800 screen by rendering a class name to this
02:59:24.920 View and giving it a BG
02:59:27.920 primary as well as a flex of one and the
02:59:31.319 padding X of 10 that's better within it
02:59:35.279 let's also render another view which
02:59:37.800 we'll use to Center our icon in the
02:59:40.200 middle so I'll give it a class name of
02:59:44.040 flex justify Das center items Dash
02:59:48.880 Center Flex D1
02:59:52.640 flex-all and a gap of five within it we
02:59:56.120 can render an image that'll have a
02:59:58.840 source equal to icons.
03:00:02.720 person and a class name equal to size of
03:00:06.840 10 as well as a tint color equal to # FF
03:00:12.479 oh and make sure to import the icons
03:00:14.640 from constants and then reload the app
03:00:18.520 while it's reloading we can also add the
03:00:21.120 text element right below it that will
03:00:23.640 simply say profile and we can style it
03:00:27.399 by giving it a text-
03:00:30.520 g-500 as well as
03:00:33.200 text-base so now if you head over to the
03:00:36.000 profile you see a little profile icon in
03:00:38.600 the middle waiting for you to implement
03:00:40.960 that profile screen what we can do is
03:00:43.920 also copy this entire view head over
03:00:46.920 into saved
03:00:48.439 and override the saved as well but this
03:00:51.680 time it's not going to be icons. person
03:00:54.560 it'll be icons. saave as well as it'll
03:00:57.920 say
03:00:59.160 save so now if you head over into the
03:01:01.880 saved you can see that it looks great as
03:01:04.880 well again I don't want to Simply give
03:01:08.319 you everything in this course because
03:01:10.520 then there's not going to be an
03:01:11.600 incentive for you to try some things out
03:01:14.560 so I invite you to go ahead and
03:01:16.920 Implement that save movie functionality
03:01:19.479 to save your favorite movies into a
03:01:21.600 collection you'll have to work a bit
03:01:23.319 with aight to have some persistent
03:01:25.200 storage and it'll be very similar to
03:01:27.600 tracking our metrics right now instead
03:01:29.880 of searches you'll be tracking the
03:01:32.040 clicks when somebody clicks a heart on a
03:01:35.120 specific movie for example and then
03:01:37.399 you'll have to create a second function
03:01:39.640 that will fetch all of the favorite
03:01:42.040 movies pretty cool right I know it might
03:01:45.040 sound difficult at first but trust me as
03:01:48.040 you get a hang of react native it'll all
03:01:50.560 start making sense very soon especially
03:01:54.080 if you dive into JS Mastery Pro where we
03:01:56.680 dive a bit deeper into how react native
03:01:59.200 Works under the hood as well as how we
03:02:01.600 can optimize it for bigger applications
03:02:04.520 great that's it for this lesson this was
03:02:07.800 a big
03:02:09.840 one and to finish this course off I want
03:02:12.800 to show you one little gotcha that I
03:02:15.160 found it's those little things that you
03:02:17.560 don't find in the documentation very
03:02:19.520 easily but rather it's a best practice
03:02:22.200 that you have to dig through GitHub
03:02:23.760 discussions to figure it out fully I
03:02:25.560 zoomed out this code so you get a better
03:02:27.720 understanding of the entire homepage
03:02:29.359 that we have right now notice a couple
03:02:31.279 of things we have a single scroll view
03:02:34.040 right here where we said show vertical
03:02:36.840 scroll indicator is set to false but
03:02:40.319 doesn't matter that we're hiding the
03:02:41.680 indicator this scroll view is a vertical
03:02:45.600 View and within that vertical view we
03:02:48.800 also have another flat list this one
03:02:51.840 right here which renders all the movie
03:02:53.840 cards those movies are also in a
03:02:56.760 vertical View and it is not generally
03:03:00.200 recommended to have two virtualized
03:03:02.600 lists or scroll views or flat lists in
03:03:05.800 the same orientation see this flat list
03:03:09.279 is not a problem this one is horizontal
03:03:11.960 and that's okay when it comes to the
03:03:13.239 performance but having two huge flat
03:03:16.680 lists that are of the same orientation
03:03:18.960 is generally not considered a good
03:03:21.560 practice we're using a scroll view to
03:03:24.080 render most of the movies and if you go
03:03:26.560 to the docs it's going to say scroll
03:03:28.760 view versus flatlist which one should
03:03:31.439 you use well scroll view renders all its
03:03:34.960 children components at once but this has
03:03:38.080 a performance downside imagine you have
03:03:41.359 a very long list of items you want to
03:03:43.560 display maybe several screens worth of
03:03:46.040 content creating Js components and
03:03:48.560 Native use for everything all at once
03:03:51.200 much of which may not be even shown will
03:03:53.319 contribute to slow rendering and
03:03:55.359 increased memory usage and this is where
03:03:58.279 the flatlist comes into play because
03:04:00.880 flatlist is smart IT renders items
03:04:03.960 lazily just before they're about to
03:04:05.960 appear and it removes the items that
03:04:08.239 scroll way off the screen to save memory
03:04:11.040 and processing time so in other words
03:04:13.960 when you have large lists of vertical
03:04:16.239 elements you want to use a flat list and
03:04:19.000 not a scroll View and in our case if you
03:04:21.640 look at the flat list we technically
03:04:23.840 didn't allow it to reach its full
03:04:25.560 potential because we have set scroll
03:04:28.040 enable to FSE which technically means
03:04:30.560 that we let the scroll view do its job
03:04:33.960 even though it is totally fine perfectly
03:04:36.640 fine for our use case as we don't have
03:04:38.960 many elements and we wouldn't even been
03:04:41.040 able to harness the power of the flat
03:04:43.359 list for bigger applications it makes a
03:04:46.479 big difference and that's exactly why I
03:04:49.520 wanted to leave this for the end of this
03:04:51.600 video while it is totally fine for
03:04:54.359 smaller apps for larger apps you just
03:04:57.399 got to be smarter and utilize everything
03:05:00.239 that the software allows you to do in
03:05:02.520 this case react natives built-in
03:05:04.319 components like the flatlist are super
03:05:07.080 powerful but you got to know how to use
03:05:09.520 them below this lesson I'll leave the
03:05:12.319 improved codebase for how the homepage
03:05:14.920 should have looked like if it had
03:05:16.960 hundreds or thousands of elements so if
03:05:20.040 you want to check it out you can go
03:05:21.520 ahead and do that but this is just one
03:05:23.720 little optimization out of hundreds or
03:05:26.399 thousands that we go over on JS Mastery
03:05:29.319 Pro so check it out cancel at any time
03:05:32.479 or get a refund if you don't like it but
03:05:35.200 given how many resources we have in our
03:05:37.160 knowledge base and within our pads it's
03:05:39.600 hard not to find something that you can
03:05:41.680 learned from and that'll help you
03:05:43.600 advance your career with that in mind
03:05:46.120 great job on coming to the end end of
03:05:48.160 this phenomenal project allowing users
03:05:51.160 to find their favorite movies search for
03:05:53.800 them and then the algorithm that
03:05:56.279 actually checks which movies have been
03:05:58.359 searched most often and therefore they
03:06:00.960 get displayed right here on the homepage
03:06:04.160 looking good feeling good it is
03:06:06.760 responsive and it is the best of mobile
03:06:09.359 development that react native offers so
03:06:12.680 thank you so much for watching and I'll
03:06:15.000 see you on Js mastery. proo have a great day

export const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
```

---

## 🗃️ 5. Initialize Database

### A. `initDB()` function in `server.js`

```js
import { sql } from './config/db.js';

async function initDB() {
  try {
    await sql`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

        created_at DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
      )
    `;
    console.log('✅ Database initialized');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('❌ Error initializing DB', err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

initDB().then(() => app.listen(port));
```

---

## ➕ 6. Create Transaction Endpoint

```js
app.post('/api/transactions', async (req, res) => {
  const { user_id, title, amount, category } = req.body;

  if (!user_id || !title || !category || amount === undefined) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'All fields are required' });
  }

  try {
    const transaction = await sql`
      INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, title, amount, category)
      VALUES (${user_id}, ${title}, ${amount}, ${category})
      RETURNING *;
    `;
    res.status(201).json(transaction[0]);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal error' });
  }
});
```

---

## 📥 7. Fetch Transactions by User

```js
app.get('/api/transactions/:user_id', async (req, res) => {
  const { user_id } = req.params;

  try {
    const transactions = await sql`
      SELECT * FROM transactions
      WHERE user_id = ${user_id}
      ORDER BY created_at DESC
    `;
    res.json(transactions);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal error' });
  }
});
```

---

## 🔐 8. Setup Authentication with Clerk

# 📱 Phase 2 – Mobile App with Expo, Clerk Auth, and Backend API Integration
... (PHASE 2 CONTENT HERE) ...

## 📦 Tech Stack (Frontend)

| Layer           | Tool/Library                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| App Framework    | Expo (React Native)                  |
| Navigation       | Expo Router                          |
| UI Styling       | NativeWind (Tailwind for RN)         |
| Auth             | @clerk/clerk-expo                    |
| HTTP Requests    | Fetch API or Axios                   |

---

## 🚀 1. Initialize Expo App

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest mobile -t with-router
cd mobile
````

Choose **TypeScript + Router** template.

---

## 🎨 2. Install NativeWind for Styling

```bash
npm install nativewind tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

### Update `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Update `babel.config.js`:

```js
plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
```

---

## 🔐 3. Install & Configure Clerk

```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
```

### Add `.env`

```
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
```

### Wrap App in `ClerkProvider` – `app/_layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

const CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = Constants.expoConfig.extra.clerkKey;

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <Slot />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 4. Add Auth Screens

### Sign In – `app/sign-in.tsx`

```tsx
import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';

export default function SignInScreen() {
  return <SignIn />;
}
```

### Sign Up – `app/sign-up.tsx`

```tsx
import { SignUp } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';

export default function SignUpScreen() {
  return <SignUp />;
}
```

### Redirect based on session (inside layout or screens):

```tsx
const { isSignedIn } = useAuth();

if (!isSignedIn) {
  router.push('/sign-in');
}
```

---

## 🧠 5. Fetch Clerk JWT for Backend

To secure backend requests:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';

const { getToken } = useAuth();

const token = await getToken();
fetch('https://your-api.com/api/transactions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    user_id: userId,
    title: 'Coffee',
    amount: 3.5,
    category: 'food'
  })
});
```

---

## 🧾 6. Add Transaction Form UI

### `app/index.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { TextInput, Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');
  const [category, setCategory] = useState('');

  const submit = async () => {
    await fetch(`http://<your-server>/api/transactions`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ title, amount, category, user_id: '<clerk_id>' })
    });
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput placeholder="Title" onChangeText={setTitle} />
      <TextInput placeholder="Amount" onChangeText={setAmount} keyboardType="numeric" />
      <TextInput placeholder="Category" onChangeText={setCategory} />
      <Button title="Add Transaction" onPress={submit} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

---

## 🔁 7. View Transactions List

Use `FlatList` to show user transactions:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { FlatList, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Feed() {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`http://<your-server>/api/transactions/<user_id>`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setTransactions);
  }, []);

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={transactions}
      keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <Text>{item.title}: ₹{item.amount}</Text>
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

const deleteTransaction = async (id: number) => {
  await fetch(`http://<your-server>/api/transactions/${id}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
  });
  refreshTransactions(); // Re-fetch list
};
```

```tsx
<Button title="Delete" onPress={() => deleteTransaction(item.id)} />
```

---

### B. Add Edit Transaction Modal

```tsx
const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
const [editData, setEditData] = useState({...item});

const updateTransaction = async () => {
  await fetch(`http://<your-server>/api/transactions/${item.id}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(editData),
  });
  setEditing(false);
  refreshTransactions();
};
```

```tsx
<Modal visible={editing}>
  <TextInput value={editData.title} onChangeText={t => setEditData({...editData, title: t})} />
  <TextInput value={editData.amount.toString()} onChangeText={a => setEditData({...editData, amount: parseFloat(a)})} />
  <Button title="Save" onPress={updateTransaction} />
</Modal>
```

---

### C. Display Total Balance

```tsx
const [balance, setBalance] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`http://<your-server>/api/balance/${userId}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setBalance(data.balance));
}, []);
```

```tsx
<Text className="text-xl font-bold">Total Balance: ₹{balance}</Text>
```

---

### D. Add Expense vs Income Pie Chart

#### Install Chart Library

```bash
npm install react-native-chart-kit react-native-svg
```

#### Component

```tsx
import { PieChart } from 'react-native-chart-kit';
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const screenWidth = Dimensions.get("window").width;

const chartData = [
  { name: 'Income', amount: totalIncome, color: 'green', legendFontColor: '#7F7F7F', legendFontSize: 15 },
  { name: 'Expenses', amount: totalExpense, color: 'red', legendFontColor: '#7F7F7F', legendFontSize: 15 }
];

<PieChart
  data={chartData}
  width={screenWidth}
  height={220}
  chartConfig={{
    backgroundColor: '#1cc910',
    backgroundGradientFrom: '#eff3ff',
    backgroundGradientTo: '#efefef',
    color: (opacity = 1) => `rgba(0, 0, 0, ${opacity})`,
  }}
  accessor={"amount"}
  backgroundColor={"transparent"}
  paddingLeft={"15"}
  absolute
/>
```

---

## 💡 3. Suggested State Hooks

# 🚀 Phase 4 – Advanced Features, Offline Mode, Notifications, and Deployment

## 1. Category Filtering (Client-Side)
... (PHASE 4 CONTENT HERE) ...

### A. UI Dropdown or Filter Chips
```tsx
const [categoryFilter, setCategoryFilter] = useState('all');

const filteredData = categoryFilter === 'all'
  ? transactions
  : transactions.filter(item => item.category === categoryFilter);
````

```tsx
<Button title="Food" onPress={() => setCategoryFilter('food')} />
<Button title="Travel" onPress={() => setCategoryFilter('travel')} />
```

---

## 📊 2. Budget Limits per Category

### A. Backend Table Extension (Optional)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS budgets (
  user_id VARCHAR(255),
  category VARCHAR(255),
  limit DECIMAL
);
```

### B. API Endpoint

```js
GET /api/budgets/:user_id
POST /api/budgets (user_id, category, limit)
```

### C. Client Usage Example

```tsx
if (totalSpent > limit) {
  alert('Budget exceeded for ' + category);
}
```

---

## 📤 3. Export to CSV or PDF

### A. Install CSV & PDF Packages

```bash
npm install react-native-csv react-native-html-to-pdf
```

### B. Generate CSV

```tsx
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';
import * as Sharing from 'expo-sharing';

const csvData = transactions.map(tx => `${tx.title},${tx.amount},${tx.category}`);
const fileUri = FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'export.csv';
await FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(fileUri, csvData.join('\n'));
await Sharing.shareAsync(fileUri);
```

### C. Generate PDF

Use `react-native-html-to-pdf` with transaction data in a template.

---

## 🌙 4. Dark / Light Theme Toggle

### A. Install NativeWind Plugin

Already handled with NativeWind. Add this logic:

```tsx
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';

const isDark = useColorScheme() === 'dark';
const theme = isDark ? darkTheme : lightTheme;
```

### B. Dynamic Tailwind Themes

Use conditional `className`:

```tsx
<Text className={isDark ? 'text-white' : 'text-black'}>Total</Text>
```

---

## 📴 5. Offline Mode with SQLite

### A. Install Expo SQLite

```bash
expo install expo-sqlite

```plaintext
/onboarding/
├── welcome.tsx
├── tutorial.tsx
└── preferences.tsx
```

### B. Conditional Routing

In root layout:

```tsx
if (!userOnboarded) {
  router.replace('/onboarding/welcome');
}
```

Store onboarding completion in SecureStore or Clerk metadata.

# Build a Full Stack Mobile Application with React Native & Expo - Beginner Friendly
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/vk13GJi4Vd0

00:00:00.080 In this video, we're going to build a
00:00:02.080 full stack mobile application that works
00:00:04.560 on your actual physical device that is
00:00:07.200 either Android or iOS. It even works in
00:00:10.240 the simulator on your laptop. This is
00:00:12.719 possible thanks to React Native and
00:00:15.120 Expo, which is something that we'll get
00:00:17.119 into the details a bit later in the
00:00:19.199 video. I cannot wait to start coding
00:00:21.199 this project with you. But first, let me
00:00:23.279 give you a quick walkthrough of the end
00:00:25.199 result so that you know what we are
00:00:26.880 building in this tutorial. So this is an
00:00:29.039 expense tracker app that I called as
00:00:31.439 wallet and in total we have five
00:00:34.000 different screens which are sign up,
00:00:36.239 login, verify email, home and create
00:00:39.200 screen. The first thing you need is to
00:00:41.200 sign up to be able to see the home
00:00:43.120 screen. Now for the sign up we have an
00:00:45.440 email verification step where you will
00:00:47.600 get a six-digit code in your inbox and
00:00:50.239 once you fill that correctly then you
00:00:52.000 will be redirected to the homepage and
00:00:54.079 initially you will not have any past
00:00:56.079 transactions. So you can visit the
00:00:58.239 create screen where you can add some
00:01:00.239 transactions that are either expenses or
00:01:02.960 income and we have couple of different
00:01:04.959 categories and depending on your
00:01:06.799 transactions your current balance will
00:01:09.040 be updated and you can delete these
00:01:11.040 transactions as well. I will also show
00:01:13.119 you how to add this classic refresh
00:01:15.360 functionality from scratch and finally
00:01:17.759 we can log out which will navigate us to
00:01:20.000 the login screen. So this is the entire
00:01:22.159 application. I'll explain every single
00:01:24.400 step so that you can easily follow along
00:01:26.560 with me from start until the end. Now,
00:01:29.040 you don't have to own a MacBook to be
00:01:31.119 able to follow along with this tutorial
00:01:33.200 because I'll show you how to run this
00:01:35.360 app on your physical device. First, we
00:01:37.759 are going to build our back end where we
00:01:39.840 have an express API that is connected to
00:01:42.640 a Postgress database on the cloud that
00:01:45.200 is provided by Neon. And once we build
00:01:47.680 our API, we're going to deploy it and
00:01:50.000 then we will start building our mobile
00:01:52.079 application with React Native and Expo.
00:01:54.640 For the authentication, we'll be using
00:01:56.399 Clerk with the email and password
00:01:58.640 combination. And in this tutorial, we
00:02:00.719 will talk about something called rate
00:02:02.560 limiting, which is a concept that you
00:02:04.719 should definitely know. And we will
00:02:06.399 implement that using Reddus as our
00:02:08.639 secondary database, which is also hosted
00:02:10.959 on the cloud. So overall, this is the
00:02:13.200 entire tutorial. I'll assume you have
00:02:15.360 never used React Native before so that
00:02:17.599 you can follow along with me from start
00:02:19.840 until the end without getting confused.
00:02:22.239 But of course, I'll assume you know the
00:02:24.080 basics of React like what is a
00:02:26.160 component, state, use effect, and JSX.
00:02:29.599 That's it. Everything we use in this
00:02:31.520 tutorial is completely free to get
00:02:33.599 started with. So, you don't have to pay
00:02:35.519 for anything that we use. So, with all
00:02:37.519 that being said, if you're ready, let's
00:02:39.200 get into it. This course doesn't cost
00:02:41.440 you anything. So, if you would like to
00:02:43.120 support my work, you can subscribe,
00:02:45.200 leave a like, and add a random comment
00:02:47.120 for the algorithms. I would really
00:02:48.879 appreciate it. And one last quick
00:02:50.560 announcement. If you're interested in
00:02:52.560 web development, I have a Udemy course
00:02:54.959 with over 100 hours of content that
00:02:57.519 includes 25 real world projects like
00:03:00.480 building a LinkedIn clone, Spotify,
00:03:03.040 Netflix, Tinder, Amazon, and even mobile
00:03:06.480 applications that work on both iOS and
00:03:09.360 Android devices. This is the cheapest
00:03:11.440 course that you can ever get and the
00:03:13.440 best part is I am updating this course
00:03:15.519 every single month with new projects.
00:03:18.080 The discount link will be in the
00:03:19.760 description. Thanks for watching and
00:03:21.519 let's get
00:03:22.519 started. So to get started with I have
00:03:25.599 created an empty folder on my desktop
00:03:28.239 called React Native wallet. You can call
00:03:30.640 this anything that you wish. Just go
00:03:32.400 ahead and open this up in VS Code. Now
00:03:35.120 we are going to need two different
00:03:36.480 folders. one for the back end and the
00:03:38.959 other one for the mobile application
00:03:41.599 right so the front end but I'd like to
00:03:44.239 call this as mobile so here we will
00:03:46.720 build the react native application but
00:03:49.120 that's going to be a bit later in the
00:03:50.879 video first we would like to build the
00:03:52.959 back end so here we'll build an API if
00:03:55.920 you don't want to watch the backend part
00:03:58.000 maybe you already know how to build it
00:04:00.159 you can just copy this entire folder
00:04:02.480 from the source code and skip to the
00:04:04.799 mobile section but I would say Please
00:04:07.360 stick around so that you can see the
00:04:09.280 entire process. Okay. Now we would like
00:04:12.000 to initialize a NodeJS application under
00:04:14.480 the back end. I will open up my terminal
00:04:16.720 and the shortcut is command J or control
00:04:19.918 J. Okay. I'll say cd into the back end.
00:04:23.040 If you type some part of it and press
00:04:24.960 tab, it'll be completed. Now let's say
00:04:27.360 mpm in it-y which is going to give us a
00:04:30.720 package json file where we can install
00:04:33.199 our packages. So I'll say mpm install
00:04:36.320 express which is the web framework that
00:04:38.479 we'll use. And if you don't know what
00:04:40.240 that means I'll explain in a second. But
00:04:43.040 by default this this is going to install
00:04:45.360 the version 5. So let's actually see
00:04:48.160 this in action. I will install it. Now
00:04:50.880 here you can see express version 5 has
00:04:53.919 been installed. But this version just
00:04:56.000 came out and I think it is not really
00:04:58.560 stable completely. So, what I'd like to
00:05:01.600 what I'd like to do is to use the
00:05:03.919 version 4, which is a lot more stable.
00:05:06.560 Now, don't ever feel like uh this
00:05:09.199 tutorial is outdated. Not at all. The
00:05:11.520 entire world still using Express version
00:05:14.400 4. Uh there isn't any much changes, but
00:05:17.280 I think we should be a little bit more
00:05:20.000 stable, right? We should use the stable
00:05:22.000 version so that this tutorial is working
00:05:25.120 completely as expected for a very very
00:05:28.080 long time. Okay? So I will clear up my
00:05:31.560 terminal and I'll say install express
00:05:34.400 but with the version
00:05:37.960 4.21.0.
00:05:39.560 Okay. So once again this tutorial is not
00:05:42.479 outdated. Don't ever feel like that. Uh
00:05:44.800 this is just a lot more stable version
00:05:47.360 that we'll be using. Okay. Just go ahead
00:05:49.600 and do this. Once you are done with it,
00:05:51.919 we can install other packages. So I will
00:05:54.880 get let's say mpm install.env env to be
00:05:58.000 able to access our environment
00:05:59.600 variables. If you don't know what that
00:06:01.360 means, we'll see this in action as well.
00:06:03.840 And then let's get the course to be able
00:06:06.000 to get rid of the course errors. And
00:06:08.560 then to be able to connect to our
00:06:10.240 database, we'll use neon
00:06:14.039 database. So just make sure to put uh
00:06:17.120 put at the beginning. So neon database
00:06:20.080 slash let's say serverless. And if you
00:06:23.680 wanted to add specific versions, just go
00:06:26.319 ahead say something like uh
00:06:29.960 1.0.0 and do the same thing for course.
00:06:33.360 Here I'll say um I think 8 sorry
00:06:39.240 2.8.5 and for the env we'll say
00:06:45.880 16.5.0. So this is the entire line.
00:06:49.039 Okay, just go ahead and run this. Now
00:06:51.199 you would like to install the same
00:06:52.800 versions as I do. So that if you're
00:06:55.039 watching this video in a future date,
00:06:57.360 your code should still work uh as I
00:07:00.840 have. Okay. So once you once you have
00:07:04.160 done this, we can get started with it.
00:07:06.880 First let's create a simple server.js
00:07:09.759 file. And here let's try to import
00:07:12.360 express. I'll say
00:07:16.039 const if I can type. Let's say express.
00:07:19.520 We'll say require the express package.
00:07:22.639 Now this is the old way of doing it. Uh
00:07:25.360 this is an old syntax. It's completely
00:07:27.840 fine. But instead of this, I'd like to
00:07:30.400 use this syntax. I'd like to say import
00:07:33.199 express from express. And to be able to
00:07:36.000 make this work, we need to visit package
00:07:38.000 JSON. And here at some point, you would
00:07:40.720 like to add the type to be module. By
00:07:43.440 default, it is common.js as you can
00:07:45.520 tell. But once you uh once you say it'll
00:07:48.720 be module, you can use import export
00:07:50.880 syntax. Now we don't really need to use
00:07:53.039 this one. Okay. Now let's say create an
00:07:55.919 express
00:07:57.479 app. And we can listen on a port. I'll
00:08:00.479 say app.listen. In my case, it'll be
00:08:04.039 5,01. And once we start listening, we
00:08:07.280 can say put a console log. Say server is
00:08:10.800 up and running on port. and let's put
00:08:14.879 the port next to it which is
00:08:17.879 501. Okay, let's try to run this file
00:08:20.720 under the back end. Just say run the
00:08:23.879 server.js with the node. Okay, so as you
00:08:27.840 can tell it is working correctly. Now
00:08:29.680 let's add a route. I'll say app.get. If
00:08:33.120 you visit localhost
00:08:35.479 501, we would like to run this function
00:08:39.519 where by default we get the request and
00:08:41.880 response and we can say raza send
00:08:45.360 something like it's
00:08:48.839 working. Now kill this withtrl c and
00:08:52.080 then run this
00:08:53.560 again and just test this out under
00:08:56.240 localhost
00:08:57.720 501. Okay, so it is working as expected.
00:09:01.040 Now we just said that Express is the web
00:09:03.200 framework. But what does that mean? So I
00:09:05.839 have some diagrams. Let's try to go over
00:09:07.760 them. Now a web framework is a readyto
00:09:11.040 use toolbox for building web
00:09:13.080 applications a lot faster and a lot more
00:09:16.000 easily. So basically at the end of the
00:09:18.560 day you don't really want to reinvent
00:09:20.480 the wheel, right? uh you would like to
00:09:22.560 use a web framework because it saves
00:09:25.360 time and it makes your code a lot more
00:09:27.920 cleaner and more organized and it
00:09:30.240 handles all the common tasks that you
00:09:32.399 can imagine like routing, error
00:09:34.640 handling, middleware, so on and so
00:09:36.959 forth. So someone already built a web
00:09:40.080 framework for you such as the Express
00:09:42.160 team. So we can just use it instead of
00:09:44.800 building our entire new web framework.
00:09:47.760 Okay, so I hope that makes sense. This
00:09:49.600 is exactly what we are trying to do. So
00:09:52.000 now that we know what a web framework
00:09:54.000 is, let's talk about the API pretty
00:09:56.399 quickly and then we'll get started by
00:09:58.640 building it. Right now you will probably
00:10:00.800 already know this but let's try to
00:10:02.560 remember it pretty quickly. So API
00:10:05.120 stands for application programming
00:10:07.200 interface which sounds a little bit
00:10:09.040 complicated but in simple terms it
00:10:11.600 allows two different applications talk
00:10:14.160 to each other right and APIs are all
00:10:17.200 around us. So when you send a mobile
00:10:19.519 payment, basically you are using an API
00:10:22.240 behind the scenes without even
00:10:24.519 realizing. So let's see. Okay. So we
00:10:26.959 have a client, we have a front-end
00:10:29.279 application that could be either your
00:10:31.519 mobile app or your desktop app, your web
00:10:34.800 application, whatever that is, right? So
00:10:37.600 you simply have a front- end app that
00:10:40.320 would like to talk with a back end. So
00:10:42.720 let's say you would like to fetch some
00:10:44.560 data. You would like to get some data
00:10:46.720 and you have the API in middle which is
00:10:49.519 going to talk with the database. So at
00:10:52.240 the end of the day you you have two
00:10:54.320 different apps, right? One front end and
00:10:56.800 one back end and API allows both of them
00:11:00.800 to talk to each other, right? So I hope
00:11:03.440 that makes sense. Probably this is
00:11:05.440 something that you already know but it's
00:11:07.839 it's nice to go over it. And we have
00:11:10.240 bunch of different requests. So we will
00:11:12.880 be building a rest API. So we have get,
00:11:16.079 we have post which is something that you
00:11:19.440 would use when you need to create
00:11:21.279 something. In this case we will create
00:11:23.360 some transactions. Then we have delete
00:11:25.920 method where you would like to delete
00:11:28.000 some data as the name suggests. And then
00:11:30.640 we have the put method. You could use it
00:11:33.519 when you want to update some data in the
00:11:36.160 database.
00:11:37.560 Okay. So I hope all that makes sense.
00:11:40.240 Now let's get started with it under the
00:11:43.160 server.js file. Now if you have realized
00:11:46.480 every single time we change something we
00:11:48.880 need to kill the server and rerun this
00:11:51.200 again. This is really annoying. Instead
00:11:53.440 we could install a package. I'll say npm
00:11:57.079 install-d nodeman. So this is going to
00:12:00.000 be like dashd means development sorry uh
00:12:04.320 yeah development dependency right dev
00:12:06.800 dependency. So we installed nodebun. So
00:12:09.440 here now we can add a script. Let's say
00:12:12.160 dev delete this part. We will say you
00:12:15.680 are going to run the server.js
00:12:18.680 file but this time with nodemon. Now
00:12:22.880 let's see what that means. You can open
00:12:24.880 up your terminal. Let's clear this up.
00:12:27.839 I'll say mpm rundev. So this is going to
00:12:31.120 run it with nodeband which means it is
00:12:33.360 watching for changes whenever you change
00:12:36.000 something. So I'll say 1 2 3 save this
00:12:38.560 file. It is going to restart all over
00:12:41.079 again. So you don't really need to kill
00:12:43.360 this and restart again. I hope that
00:12:45.600 makes
00:12:47.240 sense. Now what I'd like to do is to
00:12:50.639 create myv file so that I can put my
00:12:54.079 port and my environment variables. So
00:12:56.720 here I'll say
00:12:58.360 501. Um to be able to use it we can say
00:13:02.760 process.env. Let's first console lock
00:13:04.880 it. I'll say
00:13:07.160 process.env.port. But now this will be
00:13:09.120 undefined. So I'll just say my
00:13:13.639 port. If you take a look at the
00:13:15.760 terminal, it'll be undefined by default.
00:13:18.240 To be able to get the value, you need to
00:13:20.560 use this package that we have installed
00:13:22.880 which is called env. So you would say
00:13:27.959 importv from the env package and then
00:13:31.680 you would call the config method. So
00:13:34.399 once you have done this, you can
00:13:35.920 actually get that value from the file.
00:13:38.800 Right now this is not really undefined.
00:13:41.120 If you change it and save this file,
00:13:43.680 it'll be
00:13:45.160 updated. Okay. Now let's go and put the
00:13:48.079 previous value. And here instead of
00:13:50.440 50,0001, I'd like to use my port here.
00:13:53.600 I'll say const
00:13:55.800 port, let's say process.v.port.
00:14:00.860 [Music]
00:14:02.399 In here, I'll just put the port
00:14:04.240 environment
00:14:05.639 variable. And let's say this is going to
00:14:08.160 be
00:14:11.260 [Music]
00:14:12.360 dynamic. Okay. And just in case if this
00:14:15.519 is undefined, we can fold this back with
00:14:19.399 50,01 just like this. But as you might
00:14:22.160 know already, the main usage of the env
00:14:24.800 file is for secrets, right? Let's say
00:14:27.680 you have your database connection URL,
00:14:30.079 which is something that we will have. So
00:14:32.160 you would like to put it right here.
00:14:34.000 Let's say database URL and then whatever
00:14:37.199 the value is. You don't really want to
00:14:39.440 put this database connection string to
00:14:42.160 your codebase. So you don't really want
00:14:44.480 to say something like connect database
00:14:47.600 and then put your connection string. So
00:14:49.839 whatever that is, you don't really want
00:14:51.760 to put it as a string. Instead, you
00:14:53.920 would like to get it from the
00:14:55.760 environment variables so that when you
00:14:58.000 push your code to GitHub, nobody can see
00:15:00.880 it. it is under yourv file and you don't
00:15:03.839 really push this code to GitHub, right?
00:15:06.399 This is only like this is locally placed
00:15:09.360 in your machine in your back backend
00:15:12.000 folder. Um, we'll just see this in
00:15:14.240 action. But for now, this is going to be
00:15:16.399 it for this section. Let's try to delete
00:15:19.120 this one from here. In the next section,
00:15:21.680 we are going to connect to our database.
00:15:24.320 And by the way, it's 700 a.m. in the
00:15:27.279 morning. I just got my coffee recording
00:15:29.600 this video. So you have no reason to be
00:15:32.440 unmotivated. With that, I'll see you in
00:15:34.639 the next
00:15:35.560 section. Okay. So this is where we left
00:15:38.399 in the previous section. We built the
00:15:40.560 server.js file and now we would like to
00:15:43.199 connect to our database which is going
00:15:45.519 to be a Postgress database that is
00:15:47.920 provided by Neon. You can find the link
00:15:50.320 in the description. We'll go ahead and
00:15:52.320 sign up. They have a free plan. So this
00:15:55.120 is exactly what we'll be doing. They are
00:15:57.519 the Postgress provider. they will give
00:15:59.759 us a free Postgress database that we can
00:16:03.360 use and it is already hosted on the
00:16:06.000 cloud. So we'll just get a connection
00:16:08.399 string that we can connect to it. And as
00:16:11.279 I said they have a really generous free
00:16:13.600 plan. We can get up to 10 projects
00:16:16.639 without paying anything. And if you
00:16:19.360 would like to scale your projects you
00:16:21.600 can obviously go with the paid plan.
00:16:25.199 Now, what I'll be doing is to go ahead
00:16:27.839 and log in. I already have an account.
00:16:30.880 So, I'll log in with my GitHub account
00:16:33.759 and let's create a new project. Now, I
00:16:36.480 am on the paid plan, but it's completely
00:16:38.639 fine if you're on the free plan. You
00:16:40.639 don't need to upgrade at all for this
00:16:43.120 project at least. Okay. So, I'll say
00:16:45.519 create a new project. We can call this
00:16:47.920 anything. I'll just say wallet or let's
00:16:50.720 say React Native wallet. I'll leave
00:16:53.600 everything as it is. I'll say
00:16:56.040 create and we can say connect to our
00:16:59.160 database. So we got the connection
00:17:01.440 string that I'd like to copy. Please
00:17:03.759 don't try to use mine because I'll
00:17:05.520 delete it once I publish this video. Um
00:17:08.559 I'll go ahead under the env file and
00:17:11.280 I'll say
00:17:12.760 database URL and paste this
00:17:15.959 in. Okay, just save this. Uh this should
00:17:19.199 be good to go. Now I will create a
00:17:21.880 config folder and under this we'll have
00:17:24.799 the db.js file. So this is the file
00:17:28.160 where we can connect to our database. Um
00:17:31.600 here I'll go ahead first import the neon
00:17:34.799 from the package that we have installed
00:17:36.799 in the first section. So it is this
00:17:39.840 package and we would like to get the env
00:17:43.200 as well. So I'll say
00:17:47.400 importv/config. So this is another way
00:17:49.520 of using it in the previous file. We
00:17:52.640 just imported that and then called the
00:17:54.480 config method. So this is the exact same
00:17:57.200 thing. Now they both have different
00:17:59.360 usages but in this case this this will
00:18:02.000 work as expected. And then we can create
00:18:04.559 a SQL connection using our environment
00:18:08.000 variable. So I'll say export const SQL.
00:18:11.679 And this is something that we'll be
00:18:13.200 using a lot. For now, just say call the
00:18:15.520 neon function with the
00:18:19.559 process.v
00:18:21.559 database URL. Okay, that should be it.
00:18:25.120 We'll be using this. And let me just add
00:18:27.440 a comment. So I'll say this will create
00:18:31.440 let's say creates. So this creates a SQL
00:18:34.400 connection using our database URL. And
00:18:36.960 this is a function that we'll be using
00:18:38.799 to be able to write some SQL queries
00:18:41.559 safely. Okay. So let's save. we'll go
00:18:44.160 into the server.js file and we can
00:18:46.640 import it. So before we start our app,
00:18:49.440 we can create a function. So I'll just
00:18:52.000 go right here. Maybe we can delete this
00:18:54.400 or maybe above that I'll say create an
00:18:58.240 async
00:18:59.480 function. Uh the name could be something
00:19:02.000 like init database, right? Initialize
00:19:04.640 the database. We don't really need to
00:19:06.480 get any parameters. So we'll just delete
00:19:08.640 that. And now let's have a try and catch
00:19:11.280 block. under the try we would like to
00:19:14.160 create a transactions table right we
00:19:17.120 will store things like the amount
00:19:19.520 category title so on and so forth so I
00:19:22.640 will say a wait because this will take a
00:19:25.039 little bit of time and let's import the
00:19:27.039 SQL just make sure to put JS at the end
00:19:30.559 now it is worth mentioning that in this
00:19:32.799 tutorial we'll not be using any RMS we
00:19:36.000 will just write some row SQL code so we
00:19:38.799 are not going to be using something like
00:19:40.400 Prisma or Drisel We'll just you we'll
00:19:43.039 just write some row SQL code and the
00:19:45.280 reason for this is that most of the
00:19:47.280 tutorials would use something like ORM
00:19:49.600 and I want this to be a little bit
00:19:51.120 different where we can use some row SQL
00:19:54.400 and just see how that work. Now it
00:19:56.960 doesn't really mean that ORMs are bad.
00:19:59.440 They're actually really convenient. In
00:20:01.520 my previous tutorials I have used Prisma
00:20:04.160 a lot u so you can check them out if you
00:20:06.640 are really interested. So this tutorial
00:20:09.039 will be a little bit more simple where
00:20:10.799 we can write some row SQL code as your
00:20:14.400 projects get larger. I wouldn't really
00:20:16.880 recommend this. So it it could be really
00:20:19.280 really hard but in this case it's going
00:20:21.840 to be really convenient for us and we
00:20:24.559 don't really need to you know go into
00:20:26.559 the steps to set up an RM like Drizzle
00:20:29.919 or Prisma. So I hope that makes sense
00:20:32.480 and it is worth mentioning that. So if
00:20:34.799 you have used something like MongoDB in
00:20:37.520 the past, it is a NoSQL database which
00:20:40.320 means you store the data under the
00:20:42.400 collections but in this case we'll be
00:20:45.120 using Postgress which is a SQL database
00:20:47.760 and instead of collections we have
00:20:49.679 tables. So basically we store the data
00:20:52.720 under the tables where we have rows and
00:20:56.159 columns right. So this is an example
00:20:58.799 screenshot that that I took. So this is
00:21:01.200 the products table and we have some
00:21:04.159 columns such as ID, name, price, so on
00:21:07.600 and so forth and then we have some rows
00:21:11.039 and every single row is a different
00:21:13.520 document, right? So this is a product,
00:21:16.559 this is another one, another one so on
00:21:18.880 and so forth. Okay, so I hope that makes
00:21:21.200 sense. I just wanted to mention this
00:21:23.280 before we get
00:21:25.320 started. Okay, so let's go into the
00:21:28.159 server.js JS file and get started with
00:21:30.480 our very first SQL code. So you would
00:21:33.600 like to open up these back takes. So
00:21:35.600 this is not quote. Okay. So they are
00:21:38.000 back takes and let's say something like
00:21:41.960 create all uppercase. We'll say create
00:21:45.440 table which is going to be
00:21:48.520 transactions. Now we'll take to create
00:21:50.799 this only if if it not exists already.
00:21:54.000 Right? So I'll say if not exists only
00:21:57.760 then create it. We don't really want to
00:21:59.840 create this again and again. Now here
00:22:02.240 I'll say every single transaction will
00:22:04.720 have an ID and this could be in the
00:22:07.520 serial as well as the primary key. I'll
00:22:10.640 say primary key. So that means uh we can
00:22:14.880 identify a transaction with their ids.
00:22:17.840 Okay. And then we can have a user ID.
00:22:20.640 That means every transaction will be
00:22:23.360 will be associated with a user right so
00:22:26.000 if you create a transaction I don't
00:22:28.240 really want to see it I only want to see
00:22:30.720 the transactions that are created by me
00:22:34.480 right so that's why we'll say user ID
00:22:37.280 and this is going to be type of string
00:22:39.360 we can say v char and we can put this
00:22:42.720 value and we'll say this cannot be null
00:22:45.919 and then we will have the title for
00:22:48.159 every single transaction it'll be
00:22:50.320 basically the same thing. So I would
00:22:52.000 like to copy it and paste it. We can
00:22:54.640 duplicate this. Now we'll have the
00:22:58.440 amount. So let's say this will be
00:23:00.880 amount. Instead of string, this could be
00:23:03.720 decimal and we'll say 10. Uh and then
00:23:07.760 we'll just put two next to it. Then we
00:23:10.159 can get the category. Uh I'll go ahead
00:23:12.880 and say every transaction will have a
00:23:15.520 category. This is going to be bar chart
00:23:18.240 as well, right? It'll be a string and we
00:23:21.039 can put this value. So at maximum it can
00:23:23.679 get this amount of characters and then
00:23:26.240 finally we can add a created at field
00:23:30.000 and let's say this will be type of date.
00:23:32.480 It cannot be null and then we'll say by
00:23:35.280 default it'll just take the current
00:23:37.760 date. So whenever you create a
00:23:39.919 transaction this field will be
00:23:42.080 automatically created and it'll be
00:23:44.640 whatever the current date is. Okay. And
00:23:48.000 then we can say something like console
00:23:50.320 log uh
00:23:52.039 database
00:23:53.720 initialized
00:23:56.840 successfully. And then in the catch of
00:23:59.200 course we can just say error
00:24:02.360 initializing
00:24:04.280 initializing database and we can put the
00:24:07.200 error message. So whatever that is and
00:24:09.919 then we can exit the process with
00:24:12.480 failure. So say exit the status code one
00:24:16.159 means failure right. So say status code
00:24:19.600 one
00:24:21.159 means failure and zero means success
00:24:25.360 since we are in the catch block it'll be
00:24:27.600 one which means failure right and then
00:24:30.400 we can now call this function because
00:24:32.880 this by itself doesn't do anything we
00:24:35.440 just created it but we need to call it
00:24:37.760 and I'll say first just cut this for a
00:24:40.480 split second and I'll say initialize the
00:24:42.720 database once it is done successfully
00:24:45.840 then just go ahead run this function
00:24:49.279 where we have like where we are
00:24:52.000 listening for the uh this application
00:24:54.880 right we are starting it only if the
00:24:57.440 database initialized okay let's save
00:25:00.240 open up the terminal looks like database
00:25:03.039 initialized successfully and let's see
00:25:05.679 this under the tables so just go ahead
00:25:08.880 click to the
00:25:10.600 tables and let's see if we are going to
00:25:13.120 get any tables looks like we got this is
00:25:15.760 called this is called as transaction
00:25:17.440 actions and we have all these fields. So
00:25:20.159 we have ID, user ID, title, everything
00:25:23.679 up until the created ad and we are able
00:25:26.880 to see the type for all of them. So uh
00:25:30.559 the serial for ID means is that it's
00:25:33.440 going to be incremented one by one. So
00:25:35.760 the very first document is going to be
00:25:38.480 ID of one and then two three so on.
00:25:42.080 Okay. Now let's try to create an error.
00:25:44.720 I'll go ahead under the env for my
00:25:47.760 password. So this is your password. This
00:25:49.840 is your username here. I'll just put a
00:25:52.559 character so that my password is wrong.
00:25:55.120 And let's save this. We're going to hit
00:25:57.200 the error case. And let's scroll to the
00:25:59.600 top. It says error initializing the
00:26:02.080 database, right? And the error is the
00:26:05.200 authentication failed basically. Okay.
00:26:08.159 So this is something I wanted to
00:26:09.760 mention. If you don't really put the
00:26:11.679 correct database URL, it's going to
00:26:13.840 fail. But if you put the correct one and
00:26:16.400 save your file, it should be good to go.
00:26:18.720 And just one more thing. So here I just
00:26:21.279 said decimal 10 and comma 2. Now what
00:26:24.640 does that mean? Let me just add a
00:26:26.159 comment and read it out loud. Let me
00:26:28.960 format this. Okay. So this basically
00:26:31.200 means a fixed point number with 10
00:26:34.400 digits in total and two digits after the
00:26:37.760 decimal point. So basically this means
00:26:40.240 that the maximum value it can store will
00:26:42.799 be this value. So we have eight at
00:26:45.679 maximum in the like before the decimal
00:26:48.559 and in total it is going to be 10 uh
00:26:51.840 digits right here we have 10 digits the
00:26:55.600 decimal point could be up to two and
00:26:58.640 then in total it is 10. So I hope that
00:27:01.360 makes sense. This is something that you
00:27:03.679 just you can keep in mind and just
00:27:06.159 before we end this section. So now that
00:27:08.320 we got our environment variables, let's
00:27:10.720 set up the clerk as well, which is the
00:27:13.279 authentication
00:27:14.880 uh the authentication service, the
00:27:16.720 authentication provider that we'll be
00:27:18.640 using. So I'll go ahead and visit. You
00:27:20.880 can find the link in the description. So
00:27:23.200 clerk will be our user management
00:27:25.440 platform and they have really cool
00:27:27.679 components that we can use without
00:27:29.840 really doing that much. So we can
00:27:32.480 basically add all kinds of
00:27:34.120 authentication options to our
00:27:36.400 application. And in our case, we'll be
00:27:38.720 using email and password. So just go
00:27:41.679 ahead create an account. I think I
00:27:43.919 already have. So I'd like to log in. Let
00:27:46.880 me just loging in with the Google
00:27:48.640 account that I have. And we can create
00:27:51.600 an application. So I'll say create the
00:27:53.919 app. Name could be something like React
00:27:58.039 Native Wallet or just wallet. It's not
00:28:01.520 really that important. And for the
00:28:03.760 options, you can add anything that you
00:28:05.679 wish. I'll just go with the email
00:28:07.840 password combination. Okay, let's say
00:28:10.559 create the app. And they have all kinds
00:28:13.919 of SDKs. We'll be using the Expo. But
00:28:17.279 for now, just go ahead get the
00:28:19.520 environment variable. In the incoming
00:28:21.840 sections, we'll go through these steps
00:28:24.960 under the mobile application, right
00:28:27.600 under the mobile folder. But for now,
00:28:30.159 I'd like to put the environment variable
00:28:32.720 right here. And this is something that
00:28:35.679 we'll use later in the video. Okay, so
00:28:38.720 with that, I think that's going to be it
00:28:40.320 for this section. I'll see you in the
00:28:42.000 next one. All right, so this is where we
00:28:44.640 left. Now, we would like to go ahead and
00:28:46.640 get started with the API. Right, so we
00:28:49.679 have this function where we initialize
00:28:51.440 the database and connect to it. But now
00:28:53.919 it is time to add our endpoints. So I'd
00:28:56.880 like to delete this one. Instead of get
00:28:59.039 request, let's say we'll have a post
00:29:01.600 method, right? a post request where we
00:29:04.159 can create a transaction. So the
00:29:07.360 endpoint is going to be /
00:29:09.720 API/
00:29:12.200 transactions where we'll get the request
00:29:14.880 and
00:29:15.880 response and we'll do something right
00:29:18.480 and that something will be creating
00:29:20.640 something in the database and
00:29:22.640 specifically creating a transaction in
00:29:24.960 the database. Now I will mark this as
00:29:27.520 async. And one more thing to mention
00:29:30.080 first we will do this in the most
00:29:32.240 beginnerfriendly way. Okay. So we'll put
00:29:34.799 everything under the server.js file.
00:29:37.279 Once you are done with it we'll go ahead
00:29:39.360 and optimize our codebase where we can
00:29:42.240 have a better file and folder structure.
00:29:45.360 For now I'll just keep it simple and
00:29:47.279 just put everything on this file and
00:29:49.360 then we will optimize it. Okay. So first
00:29:52.159 let's create the try and catch block. In
00:29:54.720 the try we can try to get the uh get the
00:29:58.960 fields that user wants to send. So if
00:30:02.000 user wants to create a transaction they
00:30:04.480 would like to send the title right they
00:30:07.039 would like to send the amount the
00:30:09.640 category as well as the user ID. So we
00:30:13.440 would like to get all these values and
00:30:16.320 we can get this from
00:30:18.200 request.body and we'll say basically
00:30:20.720 dstructure all these values. Let's say
00:30:23.440 title, amount,
00:30:26.679 category, as well as the user ID. Now,
00:30:30.640 we would like to get these values, but
00:30:33.600 we can only do so if we use this
00:30:35.840 middleware. So, let's say app do use and
00:30:39.360 just go ahead call the
00:30:42.679 express.json. So, this is what we call a
00:30:45.200 middleware. This is a built-in
00:30:47.120 middleware actually. Now, you might be
00:30:49.279 asking, what does that mean? This sounds
00:30:51.279 really complicated. I have never heard
00:30:53.200 of it. So let's try to see it pretty
00:30:55.480 quickly. I have some diagrams right
00:30:58.399 here. So middleware is just a function.
00:31:01.760 So nothing else. It is just a function
00:31:04.320 but it runs in the middle between the
00:31:06.720 request and response. So let's say you
00:31:09.279 send a request from the client from your
00:31:11.840 mobile application, web application,
00:31:14.320 whatever that is. You send a request,
00:31:17.840 right? And just before you get a
00:31:19.840 response back, they can do something in
00:31:22.159 middle. This could be an authentication
00:31:24.399 check. It could be some console log. It
00:31:27.120 can be anything. And let's try to
00:31:29.600 actually build our own simple
00:31:31.919 middleware, right? So uh like first I
00:31:36.159 will delete this, right? Comment this
00:31:38.080 out and I'll get the app.get. So you
00:31:41.519 don't have to follow along. I'm just
00:31:43.039 trying to show you this. So I'll say
00:31:45.760 we'll get the request and response and
00:31:48.000 just say something like
00:31:50.360 res.end it's
00:31:53.320 working. Just before we get this
00:31:55.600 response, we can put something on the
00:31:58.000 terminal. So I'll say use this
00:32:00.080 middleware. This is our custom simple
00:32:02.880 middleware. Okay. So we'll get the
00:32:04.880 request and response as well as what we
00:32:07.120 call the next function. So here I'll say
00:32:10.480 just console log. Hey, we hit an we hit
00:32:15.519 a request and here is the method. So say
00:32:20.000 the method is and we can put request
00:32:23.679 method next to it. Once we console log
00:32:26.640 this, we can call the next function. So
00:32:29.760 let me pretty quickly
00:32:31.559 explain. When we send a get request,
00:32:34.720 let's do it. I'll
00:32:36.360 save. So this will make sense just in a
00:32:38.880 second. Let's say localhost
00:32:41.720 501 when we send a get request just
00:32:44.799 before we get the response back we would
00:32:47.600 like to put a console log right once we
00:32:50.080 have the console log we are going to
00:32:51.679 call the next function which is this one
00:32:54.640 that is going to send the response right
00:32:57.679 so just before you send the response you
00:33:00.080 would like to do something which is this
00:33:02.240 console log here we can see so I'll just
00:33:04.720 refresh again we sent the request just
00:33:07.440 before we get the response Once we are
00:33:09.440 going to hit this console log which is
00:33:11.919 coming from our middleware. I'd like to
00:33:14.480 put this as a comment. Let's say our
00:33:17.039 custom simple middleware. And this is
00:33:20.480 exactly what is happening in this case
00:33:23.120 just before uh just before you send the
00:33:26.159 response you are basically accessing the
00:33:29.159 request.body. If you don't add this
00:33:31.840 middle layer these are going to be
00:33:35.240 undefined. So I hope all that makes
00:33:37.519 sense. This is something that you should
00:33:39.760 keep in mind. And once again, middleware
00:33:42.399 is really important when you want to
00:33:44.480 have an authentication check. So let's
00:33:46.640 say user sent a request, they would like
00:33:49.279 to create something, right? Let's say
00:33:51.360 you are on Instagram, they would like to
00:33:53.360 create a post. First you need to check
00:33:55.840 if they are authenticated or not. So you
00:33:58.159 would have your oath check right here
00:34:00.399 under under the middleware function. If
00:34:02.880 they are not authenticated, you'll say,
00:34:04.399 "Hey, sorry, you cannot create the
00:34:06.080 post." But if they're authenticated,
00:34:08.079 then they can create the post. So I hope
00:34:11.359 that makes sense. This is something that
00:34:13.040 you can keep in mind. And I'll delete
00:34:16.520 these
00:34:18.679 drawings. Okay. Now uh now that we got
00:34:22.239 all these values, we can just check if
00:34:24.320 they are provided or not. So we'll say
00:34:26.399 if there is no title or if there is no
00:34:30.159 user ID. And let's do the same thing for
00:34:32.239 the rest. Let's say no
00:34:34.359 category or let's say if there is no
00:34:37.280 amount but now this could be equal to
00:34:39.520 zero right maybe amount is zero so
00:34:42.000 instead of saying not we'll say if it is
00:34:44.320 equal to
00:34:45.879 undefined in this case we'll just say
00:34:48.960 throw an error right I'll say return out
00:34:51.520 of this function send a response back
00:34:54.719 with the status code of 400 which means
00:34:58.160 there is an error and I'll say JSON the
00:35:01.599 message could be something like all
00:35:04.839 fields are
00:35:08.200 required. Okay, now let's save and we
00:35:11.760 can get like move on with it. And under
00:35:14.320 the catch, I'd like to
00:35:17.079 say, you know, error in the let's say uh
00:35:22.960 I don't know, let's just say error
00:35:25.200 creating the
00:35:27.560 transaction and we can put the error
00:35:30.000 into the terminal and since we hit the
00:35:32.400 catch block probably it means that there
00:35:35.040 is an error on the server side. plus a
00:35:37.200 res status the status code will be 500
00:35:41.200 and let's say JSON we can say something
00:35:43.880 like internal
00:35:46.460 [Music]
00:35:51.720 error okay so we just got the message
00:35:54.480 itself and let's move on in the case
00:35:56.960 that we created successfully so here
00:35:59.520 I'll say await get the SQL function and
00:36:02.880 again some back tick we'll basically say
00:36:05.760 insert inert into let's say insert into
00:36:09.440 the transactions
00:36:11.560 table and we would like to add these
00:36:14.560 values right we would like to update the
00:36:16.640 user ID column we would like to update
00:36:19.040 the title let's say amount as well as
00:36:21.760 the category now we don't need to put
00:36:24.240 the created at it'll be added
00:36:26.200 automatically because here we said by
00:36:28.560 default just get the current
00:36:31.880 date okay so these are the fields But
00:36:35.760 let's say the values will be whatever
00:36:38.400 user passes right. So here I'll say just
00:36:41.680 get the user ID and just make sure that
00:36:45.599 it is in the same order that you have
00:36:47.520 here. So user ID, title, amount and
00:36:52.280 category. So I'll say title put a comma
00:36:55.520 and then let's say get the
00:36:58.359 amount and then the category
00:37:02.680 itself. Okay. So once we insert it, we
00:37:05.920 would like to assign this into a
00:37:07.680 variable called
00:37:09.480 transaction. And to be able to get this,
00:37:12.079 you need to say
00:37:13.350 [Music]
00:37:14.599 returning just return every single
00:37:17.040 field,
00:37:18.280 right? Every single column. And then we
00:37:21.040 can say res
00:37:23.340 [Music]
00:37:24.760 status 201 which means something
00:37:27.839 created. And then we'll say as the
00:37:30.560 response we'll say JSON transaction.
00:37:33.520 This will be an array. So we would like
00:37:35.119 to get the first value which is the
00:37:37.200 created transaction. So if you don't
00:37:39.359 know what I mean, let's put the
00:37:40.800 transaction into the terminal and now
00:37:43.599 test this out. So to be able to test
00:37:45.760 this out, I'll be using a desktop
00:37:48.000 application called Postman. So you can
00:37:50.640 install it or use something
00:37:53.560 else. This is the one that I'll be
00:37:55.680 using. You don't need to sign up. Just
00:37:57.920 go ahead click to this button where you
00:38:00.400 will create a new request. It'll be get
00:38:03.280 request to let's say
00:38:05.880 HTTP
00:38:07.720 localhost
00:38:09.320 50,01 and /
00:38:13.320 API/transactions and I think I just said
00:38:15.599 get request but it should be a post
00:38:17.920 request because we are trying to create
00:38:20.440 something. Um here I'll go ahead say
00:38:22.880 post request under the body just choose
00:38:26.960 row and JSON where you would like to add
00:38:29.599 all these fields. So for now for the
00:38:32.160 user ID I'll put something random. Later
00:38:34.800 in the video this is going to be coming
00:38:36.400 from clerk. So let's say user ID. Let's
00:38:39.280 add a
00:38:40.359 title. Uh let's say something like maybe
00:38:45.079 salary and the category could be
00:38:51.400 income. And what else do we have? I
00:38:54.240 think it is description. No, it's
00:38:57.400 amount. Okay. So let's say we'll have
00:38:59.839 the amount could be something like
00:39:02.200 2,000. I think it it's going to be a
00:39:05.440 number, right? So let's not wrap it with
00:39:07.680 the quotes. Okay, I'll just send the
00:39:10.680 request. Looks like it has been created.
00:39:13.119 We got 201. Let's take a look at the
00:39:16.760 database. So here under the dashboard,
00:39:19.920 I'll say refresh. We should have our
00:39:22.320 very first document. Okay, that means it
00:39:25.040 is working correctly. Now if we try to
00:39:27.680 create something else without passing
00:39:29.920 the amount. So I'll say send the request
00:39:32.880 it says all fields are required and this
00:39:35.680 this would be the case if we don't add
00:39:37.760 any of these fields. Okay. Now let's
00:39:40.560 bring this back and once again let's
00:39:42.800 just try to pro this. If I don't add
00:39:45.280 this middleware these values will be
00:39:47.920 equal to undefined. Okay. So let's test
00:39:50.800 this
00:39:51.720 out. Okay. So it says internal error.
00:39:55.200 Let's see why this is the case because
00:39:57.440 it says we cannot read these values,
00:40:00.079 right? It says that title from the
00:40:02.480 request body is undefined. This is the
00:40:05.119 first thing that we have. So it cannot
00:40:06.960 destructure that. So let's say Ctrl Z
00:40:09.920 bring this back. Save. Now it should be
00:40:12.320 working out as expected. And when we
00:40:14.960 create something, so we put the console
00:40:17.359 log which is this one. Let me scroll to
00:40:21.040 the bottom. Okay. So it is this
00:40:23.119 transaction that we have. I said that
00:40:25.280 this will be an array. We would like to
00:40:27.040 get the first value. So this is exactly
00:40:29.920 the case. We have the array. The first
00:40:32.400 object is the created transaction. Okay.
00:40:37.119 So this was the income. Now we can
00:40:39.280 create an expense. So let's say category
00:40:42.560 could be something like expenses
00:40:46.079 uh or expense maybe. For the title let's
00:40:48.800 say
00:40:51.400 groceries. User ID could be the same.
00:40:54.160 amount let's say will be
00:40:57.079 200. Um sorry if it is an expense it's
00:40:59.920 going to be negative right? So just put
00:41:02.000 minus at the beginning. Uh just send the
00:41:04.440 request. Let's take a look at the
00:41:06.480 database. I'd like to refresh
00:41:16.200 this. Okay. So we got that as well. Same
00:41:19.119 user different amount and it is expense.
00:41:22.720 Okay. So that's it for this section
00:41:24.480 where we can create a transaction. In
00:41:26.880 the next section, maybe we can add the
00:41:29.040 get request where we can fetch a
00:41:31.119 transaction by the user ID. So I'll see
00:41:34.079 you in the next section. All right. So
00:41:36.400 this is where we left. Now I'd like to
00:41:38.400 add a get request where we can fetch the
00:41:40.960 transactions by a user ID. Just before
00:41:43.920 we do so, I will create one more
00:41:45.839 transaction. So here I'll say user ID
00:41:48.400 will be something else, right? and
00:41:51.520 category could be expense. Let's say
00:41:53.440 this will be minus 500 and let's say
00:41:56.240 something like AirPods. Okay, I'll just
00:41:59.520 say send. Um I just change the user ID
00:42:02.480 because I'll show you something in this
00:42:04.400 section. Okay, now let's get started
00:42:06.560 with the get request. I'll say app.get
00:42:09.680 and maybe I'll just put it before the
00:42:11.520 post request like absolutely not
00:42:14.240 important but this is what I'd like to
00:42:16.079 do so that I have my get request at the
00:42:18.480 very top again. absolutely not really
00:42:21.200 needed. Let's say API
00:42:25.640 transactions transactions we will fetch
00:42:28.720 the transactions by the user ID. Right?
00:42:31.440 So here I'll say whatever the user ID
00:42:34.319 we'll say uh colon this will be dynamic
00:42:36.960 that's why we put colon and then we can
00:42:39.280 put user
00:42:41.560 ID. Now what does that mean? So we will
00:42:44.720 say create a new request that will be
00:42:47.920 get let's say localhost API transactions
00:42:51.280 but only fetch the transactions of this
00:42:54.000 user let's say which has the ID of 45
00:42:57.359 right so this value will be dynamic it
00:43:00.079 could be 1 2 3 or whatever the user ID
00:43:02.960 is so that's why we say you know colon
00:43:06.960 user ID and again we'll have the async
00:43:09.920 function get the request and response
00:43:13.040 and then Right here we'll have the try
00:43:15.280 and catch block. So let me kill the left
00:43:17.680 hand side and handle the catch.
00:43:19.560 Initially I will copy this basically and
00:43:23.520 paste this in. I'll say error uh getting
00:43:27.680 the
00:43:29.240 transactions and then internal error.
00:43:32.160 Now under the try first we would like to
00:43:34.720 get the user ID from the URL right? So
00:43:38.720 you can say request.ps pram and then you
00:43:41.599 can dstructure this value. So I'll say
00:43:44.160 user ID. If you call this as something
00:43:47.040 like you know X or hello that would be X
00:43:50.240 as well right? So whatever you have here
00:43:52.800 it should be the exact same thing. And
00:43:54.880 let's try to console log it. I'll say
00:43:57.440 user ID. Save and try to send a
00:44:02.119 request. Now it'll just pend right. It
00:44:05.359 is pending because we don't really send
00:44:07.200 a response back. That's fine. Let's just
00:44:09.440 scroll to the top. This is the URL.
00:44:11.839 Sorry. This is the user ID that we got
00:44:13.680 from the pars. So if you put something
00:44:16.599 different let's say cancel send it
00:44:19.720 again. This is going to be that
00:44:22.359 value. Okay. But now let's try to
00:44:25.280 actually do something instead of console
00:44:27.520 logging it. I would like to say await
00:44:30.560 SQL and add the back tick. So I will say
00:44:35.319 select everything right every column
00:44:38.400 from the transactions
00:44:41.480 table where the user ID is matching with
00:44:46.200 the with the URL right whatever user
00:44:49.280 sends so I'll say user ID is equal to
00:44:51.920 this
00:44:54.440 value and we can say order this I'll say
00:44:58.160 order by the create that field right
00:45:02.319 create that date and we can say in the
00:45:05.200 descending order. This is something
00:45:07.280 optional. You don't have to put it but
00:45:09.040 I'll have it. And then let's say
00:45:11.359 whatever you return we can uh assign
00:45:14.240 this into a variable called transactions
00:45:17.280 that is going to be an array as you can
00:45:19.520 tell type of array and we can say res
00:45:24.760 status of
00:45:27.400 200 and then JSON is going to be what
00:45:30.800 whatever the transactions are right okay
00:45:33.599 let's save and give it a go. So I'll put
00:45:36.560 1 2 3 or let's put an ID that doesn't
00:45:39.680 exist in the database. So I'll say send.
00:45:42.240 This should be an empty array. But we
00:45:44.400 have two different transactions with
00:45:46.480 this ID. So we're going to get both of
00:45:49.440 them, right? And we have one transaction
00:45:53.119 with this user ID. So we're going to get
00:45:56.240 that. Okay. So I hope that makes sense.
00:45:58.640 Depending on the ID, you are going to
00:46:00.480 get the transactions. And if we don't
00:46:02.560 have that kind of ID, so we don't have
00:46:05.280 this ID in the database. So we'll get an
00:46:07.599 empty array. So let's put the correct
00:46:10.680 ID. Okay. So it is working as expected.
00:46:13.599 Now I'd like to add one more route. So
00:46:16.720 this section was really short. Let's try
00:46:18.880 to add one more endpoint. I'll say
00:46:21.560 app.de where we'd like to basically
00:46:23.839 delete a transaction by the transaction
00:46:26.640 ID. Right? So I'll say it'll be SL
00:46:31.079 API/transactions and to be able to check
00:46:33.920 which transaction that we would like to
00:46:35.680 delete we can get the ID and again we'll
00:46:38.640 say request and response let's say it'll
00:46:40.800 be
00:46:42.260 [Music]
00:46:43.800 async and then here we'll have the try
00:46:46.560 and catch block just like previously
00:46:49.200 I'll get the
00:46:51.400 catch and then paste this in let's say
00:46:54.319 error deleting the transaction
00:46:57.359 And then in the try we can first get the
00:46:59.839 ID. I'll say grab the ID from the
00:47:05.079 URL. So from the pmps and then we'll say
00:47:08.720 await SQL here we would like to delete
00:47:12.560 something. So I'll say delete from the
00:47:15.040 transactions table where the ID is
00:47:19.440 matching with the ID we have in the URL.
00:47:22.640 And we would like to get the all the
00:47:25.119 fields. So I'll say returning asterisk
00:47:27.760 basically everything so that we can
00:47:30.000 assign this to a variable. So I'll say
00:47:32.720 transaction or I'll just say result and
00:47:35.680 here I'll say if
00:47:38.760 resultlength is equal to zero that means
00:47:41.760 we couldn't delete anything we couldn't
00:47:43.760 find it. So here I'll say return the res
00:47:47.599 status of 404 which means not found. And
00:47:50.960 let's say JSON this is going to be
00:47:54.319 message of something like transaction
00:47:57.440 not
00:47:58.150 [Music]
00:48:00.440 found but in the else case that means we
00:48:03.200 could delete it successfully. So I'll
00:48:04.960 say resa status of 200 which means
00:48:08.720 success. um we'll say JSON and our
00:48:12.240 message could be something
00:48:13.960 like deleted successfully right I'll say
00:48:18.350 [Music]
00:48:19.480 transaction deleted successfully so
00:48:23.040 first let's try to create an error here
00:48:26.480 I'd like to delete that I'll say add one
00:48:29.200 more request and we can close these by
00:48:31.760 the way let's say delete method to API
00:48:35.240 transactions let's put an ID that
00:48:37.520 doesn't really exist I'll say send a
00:48:39.760 request
00:48:42.200 uh why did we got an error let's
00:48:45.559 see it is delete method to API
00:48:49.200 transactions it should be so here error
00:48:53.200 message basically said we cannot find it
00:48:55.760 that's why I thought do we have a typo
00:48:58.400 right that was my thought process I just
00:49:00.960 wanted to mention that now let's send
00:49:02.960 the request so here it says internal
00:49:06.319 error do we have any typos
00:49:09.880 or so invalid input syntax. Okay, so
00:49:14.240 since ID should be uh type of number,
00:49:18.000 this is going to crash. Let's put a
00:49:20.640 number that we don't really have like
00:49:22.359 999. We don't have this in the database.
00:49:25.839 So here it says transaction not found.
00:49:28.319 But if we try to delete a transaction
00:49:30.400 that we already have such as ID of two,
00:49:34.000 which is the groceries. So let's try to
00:49:36.480 delete that one.
00:49:39.359 Okay, it has been deleted successfully.
00:49:41.440 Let's double
00:49:43.640 check. Okay. And of course, we had we
00:49:46.800 had the AirPods. So, I forgot to
00:49:48.880 refresh. But looks like it has been
00:49:50.640 deleted. Let's try to delete this one as
00:49:52.720 well, which is the ID of
00:49:56.440 three. And let's
00:49:58.520 refresh. Okay, it's gone. That means it
00:50:01.280 is working correctly. Now, what's up
00:50:04.079 with this error? when you have the
00:50:06.160 string, right? When you don't have the
00:50:08.960 number on the URL, our server crashes.
00:50:12.480 Let's try to fix
00:50:14.119 it. So, what we can do is basically
00:50:17.920 first let's just say console log and I'd
00:50:20.000 like to walk you through it like my
00:50:21.839 thought process. So, first I'll say type
00:50:24.800 of ID and just put this in the terminal.
00:50:29.760 So, here I'll just send a request. Oops.
00:50:32.720 Let's open this up. center
00:50:35.960 request type should be string, right?
00:50:39.280 And if we put number, I think it should
00:50:41.680 still be string because whatever you put
00:50:44.559 in the URL, it'll be string. So, I'll
00:50:46.480 put five, maybe
00:50:48.920 55. Now, it says transaction not
00:50:52.119 found, but it doesn't fail, right? And
00:50:56.319 by the way, if you have realized, even
00:50:58.400 though we put like 55, type is still
00:51:02.160 string. This is not the case like this
00:51:04.319 is not the problem. The problem is
00:51:06.400 happening here. When you put the DSA
00:51:09.200 which is coming from the URL, this is
00:51:11.280 going to crash. So what we would like to
00:51:13.280 do before we call this before we call
00:51:16.160 this query, we can just add an if check.
00:51:19.599 So just before the result, I'll go ahead
00:51:21.760 to delete the console log and I'll say
00:51:23.960 if let's say if it is not a number,
00:51:26.880 right? So I'll say if id is not a
00:51:29.040 number, but this is string. So let's try
00:51:31.599 to convert it to uh convert it to the
00:51:35.280 number right to the integer. So I'll say
00:51:37.520 parse int. So once it is not a number we
00:51:41.359 would like to say
00:51:43.480 return rest dot status and do I have a
00:51:46.800 typo by the way. Um maybe we should have
00:51:50.800 one more parenthesis. Okay. So I'll say
00:51:53.200 res status of 400 and I'll say JSON. We
00:51:58.079 could say something like invalid
00:51:59.920 transaction ID, right? Or maybe not
00:52:02.800 found. In this case, I'll just say
00:52:04.800 invalid
00:52:10.119 ID. Okay, let's try to give it a go.
00:52:13.200 I'll put a string in the URL. Okay, it
00:52:16.880 says invalid transaction ID. This time
00:52:19.520 our server did not crash because we
00:52:22.079 didn't really hit this query, right? So,
00:52:24.640 this did not crash the server. First we
00:52:27.599 hit the if check where it is not a
00:52:29.680 number. We got this message with the
00:52:32.160 status. Okay. So I hope that makes
00:52:34.240 sense. That's going to be for the delete
00:52:36.400 method. In the next section we are going
00:52:38.480 to build one more uh one more endpoint
00:52:41.599 and then I think it should be good to
00:52:43.280 go. So I'll see you in the next section.
00:52:46.000 Okay. So this is where we left. So far
00:52:48.400 we have built three different endpoints
00:52:50.559 where we can get the transactions,
00:52:53.119 create one and delete one. So these are
00:52:55.839 the things that will be calling from the
00:52:58.480 homepage as well as the create page. So
00:53:00.880 we can create an expense or income. We
00:53:03.760 can fetch them and we can delete them.
00:53:06.400 But now we are missing one thing that is
00:53:08.880 to get the summary. Right? So we would
00:53:11.680 like to get the total balance, the
00:53:13.920 income as well as the expenses that we
00:53:16.160 have. So let's try to build that
00:53:18.280 endpoint here. I'll go under the
00:53:20.640 server.js JS file and I'll add a get
00:53:23.119 request at the very bottom. So I'll say
00:53:26.599 app.get and it'll be
00:53:32.359 /appi/transactions. Let's say it'll be
00:53:34.400 slash summary and then the user ID so
00:53:38.160 that we know which user summary that we
00:53:40.559 get right here. I'll say it'll be an
00:53:43.599 async
00:53:45.079 function. Get the request and response.
00:53:48.000 And let me shrink the left hand side.
00:53:50.160 Okay. Okay, so we're going to call this
00:53:52.720 uh controller function. Let's have the
00:53:54.880 try and catch. I'd like to get our catch
00:53:57.920 as
00:54:01.079 always. Let's say error getting the
00:54:05.590 [Music]
00:54:06.839 summary and then the internal error. So
00:54:09.839 whatever that is first, I'd like to get
00:54:12.319 the user ID from the
00:54:15.559 request.prams and then we'll get three
00:54:18.000 different results. So as I said the
00:54:20.319 balance the income as well as the
00:54:22.200 expenses. So first uh let's get started
00:54:24.960 with the balance. I'll say balance
00:54:26.960 result and we'll say a rate call the SQL
00:54:30.240 function with this query. Oops. Let's
00:54:32.880 say double back and then within this
00:54:35.440 I'll say select. Now we'll use something
00:54:37.920 different called class. Uh let's
00:54:41.400 say I think this is how we type it. Um
00:54:44.880 all right. So here we'll put two
00:54:46.960 different values. The first one will be
00:54:49.359 the sum the total of amount and let's
00:54:52.480 make this to be all uppercase. We're
00:54:54.960 going to sum the amount. But now if this
00:54:57.280 is undefined, we would like to get the
00:54:59.680 zero value, right? So just think about
00:55:02.720 it. You just signed up. You don't have
00:55:04.800 any transactions in the database. This
00:55:07.520 is going to be equal to undefined,
00:55:09.440 right? In this case, you would like to
00:55:11.200 get the zero as the fallback value. So
00:55:14.640 this is exactly what we are doing. And
00:55:16.800 then we'll say call this as balance. You
00:55:19.599 can call this anything like like hello
00:55:21.760 as well. But of course it should be
00:55:23.680 something makes sense such as balance.
00:55:26.079 We'll say select those from the
00:55:28.079 transactions table
00:55:30.680 where the user ID is equal to this value
00:55:34.559 that we have. So if you think about it,
00:55:36.800 this feels like an English sentence,
00:55:39.040 right? So we have either the total
00:55:41.200 amount if it is undefined, we'll get the
00:55:43.680 zero. Let's call this as balance and
00:55:46.640 select everything from the transactions
00:55:49.359 where the user ID is matching with this
00:55:52.480 one. Okay. So this is the total balance
00:55:55.520 and then I'd like to do the same thing
00:55:57.359 for the income. I'll say income result
00:56:01.359 and then let's
00:56:02.599 say
00:56:05.000 SQL and call the function. Okay. So one
00:56:09.040 thing I'd like to mention now income is
00:56:11.680 plus right it is positive and
00:56:14.599 expenses are negative. So we will say if
00:56:18.160 amount is greater than zero it means it
00:56:21.040 is an income and if it is an expense
00:56:23.599 amount is less than zero right. So just
00:56:26.559 keep this in mind because we'll be using
00:56:28.319 it here. I'll say select once again I'll
00:56:32.240 get the exact same thing because it
00:56:34.559 could be undefined. We would like to get
00:56:36.400 the zero value in that case. And you can
00:56:39.119 format this if you really wanted to.
00:56:41.200 Then we'll say call this as income and
00:56:43.920 let's say from transactions put the
00:56:46.960 table name. You can go to the next line
00:56:49.200 and then we'll say where the user ID is
00:56:52.400 equal to this value. Again I'm too lazy
00:56:55.440 to type this out. So I'll go ahead copy
00:56:57.440 and paste. But one more thing we'll say
00:56:59.920 and the amount is greater than zero.
00:57:03.599 Okay, that means this is our income
00:57:05.440 result. I'd like to duplicate
00:57:08.680 this. I
00:57:10.760 think I'll just give a space and I'll
00:57:13.440 say
00:57:15.710 [Music]
00:57:17.240 expenses. Okay. So, I'll say amount
00:57:19.599 zero. Let's call this as expenses from
00:57:22.960 the transactions. Everything will be the
00:57:25.200 same but amount will be less than zero.
00:57:28.240 If this is the case, these are going to
00:57:30.240 be our expenses. And now we can
00:57:32.559 basically say res
00:57:35.319 status of 200 and then put the
00:57:39.319 JSON here. I'll put three different
00:57:41.760 values. The
00:57:43.559 balance, let's say it'll be balance
00:57:46.000 result. This is going to be an array.
00:57:47.920 Let's get the first value and then
00:57:49.960 balance. So here if you said balance 1 2
00:57:53.200 3 here you need to say 1 2 3 as well.
00:57:56.640 Okay. So this is whatever you put right
00:57:58.559 here in all these fields. Let's
00:58:01.760 duplicate this. This is going to be
00:58:03.760 income and we'll say income result do
00:58:08.119 income. Duplicate that. This is going to
00:58:10.640 be
00:58:12.520 expense or even expenses. This is how I
00:58:15.839 called it. Let's say expenses result.
00:58:19.440 And then here we could say
00:58:23.960 expenses. Okay. Let's save and give it a
00:58:26.640 go. We have Let's take a look at the
00:58:29.680 database. I think we only have one
00:58:31.920 transaction. So, let's try to create
00:58:34.400 another one. I'll go find the post
00:58:37.160 method. Get the body. So, these are all
00:58:40.559 the fields. I would like to add
00:58:42.079 something like I don't know, let's say
00:58:44.920 freelance work. It is also an income.
00:58:47.680 Let's say it is 1,000.
00:58:50.400 So for the same user and let's add an
00:58:54.440 expense here I'd like to call this as I
00:58:57.839 don't know let's say minus 1,500 uh
00:59:01.520 let's say
00:59:04.200 rent okay send the request now we would
00:59:06.960 like to get the summary here I will
00:59:10.079 create one more
00:59:12.119 request API transactions it was summary
00:59:16.480 and then the user ID so that it'll be 1
00:59:18.880 2
00:59:20.040 three sent the request. Okay, so this is
00:59:22.880 the total balance, the income and the
00:59:25.680 expenses, right? So in total we have
00:59:28.720 3,000 income. Let's double
00:59:31.480 check. So 2,00 1,000 it is three in
00:59:35.520 total and then minus 1,500 which makes
00:59:39.359 our balance to be 1,500 as well. So
00:59:42.880 again how that work is completely
00:59:45.599 depending on the amount field. So if it
00:59:48.160 is greater than zero, it's going to get
00:59:50.400 it as an income and if it is less than
00:59:52.400 zero, it'll get it as an expense and
00:59:54.799 then depending on that we will get this
00:59:56.799 output. Okay, so I hope that makes
00:59:58.960 sense. Now that's going to be it for the
01:00:00.799 section where we build the transaction
01:00:03.359 summary endpoint depending on the user
01:00:05.760 ID and these are all the endpoints that
01:00:08.400 we're going to have. We are not going to
01:00:10.079 add anything else but there is one
01:00:12.240 concept that I'd like to talk about
01:00:14.480 which is called rate limiting. It is
01:00:16.880 something that you should definitely
01:00:18.319 know as a beginner. I think it'll just
01:00:20.319 make a huge difference and I'd like to
01:00:22.640 talk about it in the next section. So
01:00:24.880 I'll see you there. So we are going to
01:00:27.520 talk about something called rate
01:00:29.200 limiting. But before we do so, let's try
01:00:31.440 to see the problem that we have in the
01:00:33.359 first place. So why do we need rate
01:00:35.599 limiting? So imagine this. You have a
01:00:38.240 really toxic user, right? So all he
01:00:40.880 wants to do just break your application.
01:00:43.680 They visit homepage and non-stop they
01:00:46.000 refresh this page. So they are sending
01:00:48.319 constantly requests, right? Or they go
01:00:51.119 into the create page constantly they are
01:00:53.599 just creating something. So it is as if
01:00:56.559 they are like spamming nonstop, right?
01:00:59.440 At some point your server might crash
01:01:02.400 and imagine bunch of different users
01:01:04.960 doing this. So your server is definitely
01:01:07.839 will be overloaded, right? it'll be
01:01:10.280 overwhelmed. And this is where rate
01:01:12.400 limiting comes into play. Let's read it
01:01:14.640 out loud and we'll see the example. So
01:01:17.040 rate limiting is a way to control how
01:01:19.280 often someone can do something on a
01:01:21.359 website or on the application like how
01:01:24.000 many times they can refresh a page, make
01:01:26.559 a request to an API or try to login. And
01:01:30.880 like we can put some limits like only
01:01:34.000 100 requests per user every 15 minutes,
01:01:37.680 right? So they can send only 100
01:01:40.280 requests per user and every 15 minutes.
01:01:44.799 If you wanted to, you can increment it,
01:01:46.640 decrement it depending on your use case.
01:01:49.440 And here is how it'll work. Just before
01:01:52.000 our API right in front of it, we will
01:01:54.799 put the rate limiter so that we can uh
01:01:58.680 basically control the amount of requests
01:02:01.520 that we process. So here let's say we're
01:02:04.640 going to get first 100 requests. So they
01:02:08.079 all will be responded successfully. But
01:02:10.720 then for the 101 right 101st request
01:02:15.680 it's going to be cancelled. We'll say
01:02:17.839 something like you send too many
01:02:19.839 requests please try again later. And the
01:02:23.200 status code for this is 429 which means
01:02:26.799 too many requests. And here also I have
01:02:29.440 some notes where the rate limiting helps
01:02:32.000 with preventing the abuse and you know
01:02:35.119 protecting your servers from getting
01:02:37.839 overwhelmed right
01:02:40.359 overloaded. Okay. So these this is
01:02:42.880 basically what rate limiting is and can
01:02:45.839 you can you tell where can we implement
01:02:48.079 it? So just in front of your API right
01:02:51.119 just before you send a response back
01:02:53.760 which is going to be as a middleware
01:02:57.040 right. So we are going to get their
01:02:58.720 request. We will check if they should be
01:03:01.119 rate limited or not. So this is a
01:03:03.280 perfect use case for a middleware as
01:03:05.440 well. Right? So we'll put the middleware
01:03:07.920 as our rate limiter and then we will
01:03:10.640 send a response back depending on
01:03:13.040 depending on the status. Right? Either
01:03:15.599 success or it'll be failed. And we can
01:03:18.799 implement this by using a radius
01:03:21.119 database as well as a rate limiting
01:03:23.599 package. And these are going to be
01:03:25.839 provided by Upstash. So you can find the
01:03:28.640 link in the description. Again, they
01:03:30.640 have a free plan that we can use. I'll
01:03:32.880 go ahead and visit. So here we can see
01:03:35.280 there are a bunch of different products.
01:03:37.440 We'll be using the Reddus with the rate
01:03:39.559 limiting. So I already have an account.
01:03:42.480 I'll just go ahead and log in. And I'd
01:03:45.119 like to create a Reddis
01:03:47.400 database. Um let's give it a name like
01:03:50.319 wallet or let's say React Native wallet.
01:03:54.160 the region. I'll select the one that is
01:03:56.400 closest to me. You can choose any of
01:03:58.799 these. And I'll leave everything as it
01:04:00.880 is. I am on the free plan just like you.
01:04:03.280 I didn't pay anything. Let's say next.
01:04:06.319 Create it. And we'll get some
01:04:08.480 environment variables. Let's scroll down
01:04:11.039 a little bit. It's going to be the
01:04:12.880 up-ash radius. Let me zoom in. So, it'll
01:04:16.240 be up stradd URL. Let's copy it. Visit
01:04:20.079 the env file. paste this in and then
01:04:25.119 we'll get the actual value. So, copy
01:04:28.520 this. Paste this in and then do the same
01:04:31.839 thing for the pressed
01:04:41.319 token. Let's say equal to to this value.
01:04:45.039 Now, we'll be using them and maybe we
01:04:47.520 can optimize our codebase a little bit.
01:04:50.720 uh we will absolutely optimize this
01:04:53.119 entire file. So we will actually extract
01:04:56.160 these you know functions to these routes
01:04:58.720 to different folders maybe in the next
01:05:00.880 section. Okay. So I'll just dedicate an
01:05:02.880 entire section for the code
01:05:05.720 organization. But for now let's say
01:05:08.799 create the middleware folder and we will
01:05:11.680 add the
01:05:13.559 rate
01:05:15.319 limiter.js file. So this is the
01:05:18.480 middleware we'll go in and then config
01:05:21.839 here. Let's try to configure the upst.
01:05:24.559 So I'll say upstach.js. So here we'll
01:05:27.280 just create an instance and it'll be
01:05:30.240 looking like this. So it'll be coming
01:05:31.920 from the database. Actually I'd like to
01:05:34.160 copy this and paste this in. So here
01:05:37.920 instead of putting the URL and token as
01:05:40.640 these values we can grab them from the
01:05:43.119 env file. So I will actually delete
01:05:45.520 those and I'll say the radius instance
01:05:49.039 will be created depending on our env
01:05:52.480 file. So I'll say radius from
01:05:55.960 env method and then we can put the
01:05:58.880 limiter itself. So I'll say call the
01:06:01.839 rate limit and I think we haven't
01:06:04.640 installed this package as well as the
01:06:06.880 rate limit. So let's type this out and
01:06:09.039 we'll install it. I'll say import the
01:06:11.280 rate
01:06:12.760 limit from let's say at upstach. So
01:06:17.440 upstach / rate limit. Go ahead save this
01:06:20.960 file and we can delete those because we
01:06:23.200 don't really want to like this is for
01:06:25.039 testing purposes. They have in the
01:06:26.880 documentation like we can give it a go
01:06:28.960 but for now let's try to install these
01:06:31.440 packages. I'll kill the back end. Clear
01:06:34.079 the terminal and in windows you can say
01:06:36.400 cls to clear the terminal. in wind in
01:06:39.440 Mac it is either clear or command K.
01:06:42.960 Okay, so that was something that I
01:06:44.720 wanted to mention. Now let's say npm
01:06:46.720 install at stash / Reddus and let's do
01:06:51.280 the same thing for the rate limit also I
01:06:53.520 would like to put some specific
01:06:54.960 versions. So I'll say
01:06:59.160 1.34.9 and then for the rate limit. So
01:07:02.960 for the rate limit first let me kill the
01:07:05.200 left hand side so that we can see it
01:07:06.880 clearly. It'll be
01:07:10.039 2.0.5. Okay, just go ahead and install
01:07:15.160 them. So, it's been installed. Now, we
01:07:17.839 can kill the
01:07:20.480 uh actually let's start it. Not kill
01:07:23.039 let's say mcam rundev. It is started. We
01:07:26.000 can delete those. We don't really need
01:07:28.720 it. This is just for testing purposes
01:07:30.880 just to check if it is working or not.
01:07:33.119 But instead of doing this, we would like
01:07:35.039 to uh configure the rate limit. So here
01:07:38.559 we can use the sliding window. So this
01:07:42.160 is a algorithm that we can use. And then
01:07:45.280 we'll say something like 100 requests
01:07:48.559 per minute, right? We can say 60
01:07:51.039 seconds. This is how many requests that
01:07:53.599 we can handle. And you could definitely
01:07:55.760 update these if you really wanted to. So
01:07:57.920 you can go a little bit more extreme
01:08:00.160 like only one request per 10 seconds but
01:08:03.760 in this case your application would be
01:08:05.760 unusable right you can go with like 100
01:08:09.280 per 30 seconds 60 seconds however you
01:08:12.640 wanted to right so you can even check uh
01:08:15.760 a quick research what are the best
01:08:17.839 values all right so I think we have some
01:08:20.880 uh typos in our code this should be rate
01:08:23.679 limit all lowercased after the r um I'll
01:08:27.198 go ahead head update this one as well.
01:08:29.040 So I think that's why we couldn't get
01:08:30.719 the auto completions right now. We can
01:08:33.439 get that and then this is not going to
01:08:35.198 be right. So let's say it'll be new rate
01:08:38.158 limit instance just like
01:08:41.319 this rate limit and let's say rate
01:08:45.080 limiter and I'd like to basically delete
01:08:48.000 those. I'll say export default this rate
01:08:51.759 limiter instance. We'll be using it in a
01:08:54.479 in a second. Now to be able to get the
01:08:57.600 environment variables, we need to import
01:09:00.238 the
01:09:01.950 [Music]
01:09:03.080 env. Let's call the config module. So
01:09:06.560 that's the entire configuration. I just
01:09:08.479 went pretty slowly, but in total it's
01:09:11.359 only eight lines of code. That's all you
01:09:13.839 need with the spaces. It is 11 lines of
01:09:16.640 code. Okay. So that's it for the
01:09:18.880 upstigation.
01:09:20.560 We'll be using this rate limiter to
01:09:22.479 check if user can successfully send
01:09:25.040 their request or should like should they
01:09:27.679 be rate limited and this is where this
01:09:30.158 file comes into play. I'll say import
01:09:32.319 the rate limiter that we have and just
01:09:34.719 make sure to put the extension at the
01:09:36.719 end since we are using type of module
01:09:40.080 right you have to put the extension at
01:09:43.120 the end for the local imports okay I'll
01:09:46.880 create a function let's say con rate
01:09:50.080 limit or rate limiter however you would
01:09:52.880 like to call it maybe we can call this
01:09:54.880 as rate limit so this will be the
01:09:58.000 instance for rate limit the name is not
01:10:00.400 really important But I think this looks
01:10:02.320 a little bit more cleaner so that we can
01:10:04.560 have the right limiter as our
01:10:06.400 middleware. Right? So I'll say this is
01:10:08.239 the async function where we would like
01:10:10.239 to get the request response as well as
01:10:13.280 the next function. Since this is a
01:10:15.760 middleware once we are done with it,
01:10:17.440 we'll call the next function. So here
01:10:20.159 I'll say maybe first try and catch. In
01:10:23.600 the catch we can just say console log
01:10:26.320 rate limit error and put the error and
01:10:31.199 then we can call the next function with
01:10:33.199 the error itself. Now in the try we can
01:10:36.320 get the success case. So we'll just
01:10:38.560 check if it is success or not. We can
01:10:41.199 say await write limit dot limit and you
01:10:46.159 would like to put an identifier. So this
01:10:49.199 could be something like user ID or it
01:10:51.760 could be IP address depending on this
01:10:54.159 value user will be identified and they
01:10:57.040 would be rate limited. Now in our case
01:10:59.280 we don't really have the authentication
01:11:00.800 on the backend side. So for now I'll
01:11:03.120 just put something like my rate
01:11:06.120 limit but as I said in production grade
01:11:09.360 applications you would like to have
01:11:11.360 something like uh let's say either user
01:11:14.679 ID you could have IP address so on and
01:11:18.159 so forth. uh in our case let's just keep
01:11:20.480 it simple just to understand this
01:11:22.320 concept and just leave the like a
01:11:25.600 hard-coded uh key a hard-coded
01:11:28.760 identifier and then we'll say if it is
01:11:31.440 not success right we can say return res
01:11:37.320 status and you already know it is port
01:11:40.320 29 which means too many
01:11:42.840 requests we'll say send this
01:11:48.760 message please try again
01:11:52.760 later and then we can uh like in the
01:11:56.159 else case if it is not if it is success
01:11:59.440 sorry if it is success we can call the
01:12:01.360 next function successfully but if it is
01:12:03.679 not success we'll just return a status
01:12:05.920 code with the error message and then at
01:12:09.199 the very end we can say export
01:12:12.000 uh
01:12:12.920 this as a default
01:12:16.719 let's say rate limiter. So this is the
01:12:19.040 middleware. We would like to put it in
01:12:20.880 front of our API, right? This is our API
01:12:23.679 just in front of it where we have the
01:12:26.000 middle layers. We can basically say app
01:12:28.560 do
01:12:29.400 use rate limiter. Okay. Now let's
01:12:33.520 actually try to test this out. I'd like
01:12:35.920 to be a little bit more extreme. So I'll
01:12:38.320 say only four requests per minute. And
01:12:41.440 I'll send my requests. So
01:12:44.679 one it is successfully done. Let's say
01:12:47.600 two three four. Now the fifth one should
01:12:52.080 fail. Too many requests. Please try
01:12:54.800 again later. So basically we cannot send
01:12:57.360 any more requests. And if you take a
01:12:59.679 look at the
01:13:01.159 database you will be able to see that we
01:13:03.760 are rate limited. So we have sent four
01:13:06.120 requests. Now we are rate limited. And
01:13:08.800 this was our key. Now this will block
01:13:11.679 the entire application right all the
01:13:14.320 users but as I said you would like to
01:13:16.800 make it um per user and to be able to
01:13:20.159 make that you would either add the user
01:13:22.719 ID or something like IP address in this
01:13:26.080 case I'd like to keep it simple my goal
01:13:28.320 with this uh with this section is to
01:13:31.600 teach you the rate limiting so for that
01:13:33.679 reason I'll keep it simple so here I'll
01:13:36.000 just put a comment here we
01:13:39.960 list kept it
01:13:42.280 simple. So in a real world application,
01:13:45.120 you would like to put the user ID or the
01:13:47.360 IP address as your key. Okay, so I hope
01:13:50.320 that makes sense. That's going to be for
01:13:52.719 this section as well. Let's try to fix
01:13:54.560 this. I'll put 100 per 60 seconds. Um in
01:13:58.960 the next section, we can basically
01:14:01.360 organize our files and folders and then
01:14:04.159 we can get into the mobile application.
01:14:06.480 So I'll see you in the next section. All
01:14:09.040 right. So let's try to organize the
01:14:11.320 server.js file. Currently it looks like
01:14:14.080 a complete mess because we we have
01:14:16.480 everything right here in this file. Now
01:14:19.040 what you would like to do basically take
01:14:21.360 every one of these routes and put it
01:14:23.600 under a folder. So I will create the
01:14:26.800 routes folder and let's try to see how
01:14:29.440 we can get started with it. So
01:14:31.760 everything is related to transactions.
01:14:33.760 Right here we can see we have API
01:14:35.760 transactions for the summary you know to
01:14:38.239 delete create get everything is related
01:14:41.199 to transactions. So we will create a
01:14:43.600 route for that. I'll say
01:14:46.920 transactions
01:14:48.440 route.js file and then we can create a
01:14:51.520 router. So just follow along with me.
01:14:53.840 It'll make sense in a second. Let's say
01:14:55.840 import the express from express and we
01:14:58.480 would like to create a router and I'll
01:15:01.440 say express.outer router and just make
01:15:04.719 sure that this R is capitalized. Then
01:15:07.360 I'll say export default this router
01:15:11.280 here. We'll put all of our routes. So
01:15:14.000 just save. Go ahead. Get everything that
01:15:16.880 you have seen here. Right? Just cut
01:15:19.239 that. Paste this right here. And instead
01:15:22.880 of app, we don't really have app, right?
01:15:25.120 We have router. So we'll say
01:15:28.120 router.get. We'll say
01:15:30.760 router.post router. need and one more
01:15:34.080 get. Now let's try to import the
01:15:37.800 SQL we'll say JS at the end. Okay. Now
01:15:42.320 to be able to use the transactions to be
01:15:44.560 able to use this file we need to import
01:15:46.719 it. So if you have realized every one of
01:15:49.600 these routes has the /
01:15:52.600 API/transactions right. So this is
01:15:54.960 something common that we have on all of
01:15:57.440 our routes. So we can put it right here.
01:15:59.920 I'll say app.use. This is a middleware
01:16:02.960 that we'll add. Let's say slap
01:16:08.600 API/transactions. If we got a request to
01:16:11.760 this endpoint, we basically want to
01:16:14.080 import this route. So let's say maybe
01:16:17.280 import it and put it right here. I'll
01:16:20.000 say import
01:16:24.840 transactions route from this file. So
01:16:28.560 we'll go into the routes and get this
01:16:30.960 one. Just make sure to put the js at the
01:16:33.800 end and we'll just put it right here.
01:16:36.880 Now since we have /
01:16:39.640 ai/transactions, we can delete them from
01:16:42.000 here. So if it is only /
01:16:45.000 ai/transactions, we can just put slash,
01:16:47.520 right? And here this field already
01:16:50.719 added. So this has been prefixed. We can
01:16:53.199 delete that. Do the same thing for this
01:16:55.840 one.
01:16:57.679 And I think for the very first
01:17:01.719 one so let me just put them side by side
01:17:04.480 and try to explain what we have done.
01:17:07.360 I'll just do mod
01:17:11.960 alapi/transactions which is going to be
01:17:13.840 prefixed with every single one of these
01:17:16.000 routes. So we are basically saying that
01:17:18.640 if we get a request to /
01:17:22.040 API/transactions go ahead and run this
01:17:24.159 file where we have the get request post
01:17:27.199 delete and then this one. So if we get a
01:17:30.080 request to /
01:17:32.600 API/transactions / summary and then a
01:17:35.280 user ID just go ahead run this function
01:17:38.320 and same for these ones. Okay so let's
01:17:40.960 open up the terminal. Looks like nothing
01:17:43.280 has crashed right it is working as
01:17:45.360 expected and we can give it a go like
01:17:48.000 I'll send a request we should get a
01:17:50.080 response back as exactly as it was
01:17:53.080 before so that's the very first thing
01:17:55.280 that we have done right this is the
01:17:57.120 first optimization that we can add now
01:17:59.600 one more thing I'd like to mention let's
01:18:01.679 say later at some point you add some
01:18:04.000 products to this application so you
01:18:06.320 would say create a rod under the API
01:18:09.440 under the
01:18:10.679 products and you would create a route
01:18:13.280 for that as well. So products route and
01:18:15.920 you could put every single route that is
01:18:19.120 that is about products. Okay, so just
01:18:21.600 keep that in mind. This makes it really
01:18:23.600 really convenient because let's say 1
01:18:26.400 month later you come back to this
01:18:28.000 codebase, you would like to update
01:18:30.400 something that is related to products.
01:18:32.640 You don't need to visit this file at
01:18:34.400 all, right? You don't have anything to
01:18:36.320 do to do with it. You'll just visit the
01:18:39.040 product routes and update that file and
01:18:41.280 you are done. But of course we don't
01:18:43.440 have any products. One more thing now
01:18:47.040 this file could get really messy because
01:18:49.440 we have bunch of different functions.
01:18:51.520 They could be 50 lines of code, 100
01:18:53.920 lines of code, so on and so forth. What
01:18:56.400 you can do is take these functions and
01:18:59.120 put them under uh a specific folder as
01:19:02.480 well. So this is what we call a
01:19:04.400 controller. So I'll go ahead create the
01:19:06.480 folder called controllers. So these are
01:19:09.120 some best practices that you can keep in
01:19:11.120 mind and I'll say
01:19:13.080 transactions
01:19:16.440 controller.js file. Okay. So this is
01:19:19.360 what we call the get transactions by
01:19:21.920 user ID. Right? So I will cut this and
01:19:24.560 create a function. Let's say it'll be an
01:19:27.360 async function where we can say get
01:19:31.239 transactions by user ID. You can call
01:19:34.320 this anything but this is the name that
01:19:35.920 I'll be going with and then I'll paste
01:19:38.080 this in. Let's try to delete this part
01:19:41.560 completely and this one. Okay, so this
01:19:44.719 should be good to go. Now we can add
01:19:46.480 this function right here. Let's say get
01:19:48.679 transactions by user ID. Let's try to
01:19:52.159 import it.
01:19:57.690 [Music]
01:20:01.120 So, we need to go one up under the
01:20:03.880 [Music]
01:20:05.080 controllers. Oops. Let's say controllers
01:20:07.760 and get this
01:20:09.320 file. Okay. Now, let's do the same
01:20:11.679 thing. And do we have a typo? Get
01:20:14.719 transactions by user
01:20:17.719 ID. So, since this is not highlighted, I
01:20:20.560 thought it is not working. Let's open up
01:20:22.239 the
01:20:23.080 terminal. Okay, it looks like Okay, so I
01:20:26.320 think we forgot to say export this,
01:20:28.080 right? So, I'll say export. Now we can
01:20:30.159 get that. Now it's been highlighted.
01:20:32.159 Okay. The other thing is to create one.
01:20:35.120 So I will basically cut this entire
01:20:37.719 function. You can make it as an arrow
01:20:40.000 function as well. But I'll just be
01:20:42.080 consistent. I'll say async function.
01:20:45.280 Paste this in. The name could be let's
01:20:48.640 say create
01:20:51.050 [Music]
01:20:52.679 transaction. And this is not an error
01:20:54.960 function. So we can delete this.
01:20:59.679 and try to import
01:21:01.800 it. Okay, now let's get the delete
01:21:07.430 [Music]
01:21:09.320 one. So I'll cut that. Let's say delete
01:21:14.110 [Music]
01:21:17.480 transaction export async
01:21:20.440 function. It's kind of boring. You can
01:21:22.880 skip this section. I mean just pretty
01:21:25.360 quickly uh speed up here. I'll say
01:21:28.920 delete
01:21:31.640 transaction and I think we should be
01:21:34.080 good to
01:21:36.040 go. And then very last one is to get the
01:21:39.360 summary. Right. I'll cut that. Oops.
01:21:57.199 And I'll just paste this in. Let's try
01:21:58.960 to fix
01:21:59.960 [Music]
01:22:02.760 it. Okay. So, let's save and try to see
01:22:07.199 the terminal if we have any errors or
01:22:09.480 not. In this file, I think we are using
01:22:12.679 SQL, but we haven't really imported.
01:22:15.840 Let's try to import that and put the js
01:22:18.719 at the
01:22:20.040 end. Delete this.
01:22:23.440 Okay, so everything should be working
01:22:24.960 out. Let's take a look at the terminal
01:22:26.639 and try to give it a go. Looks like we
01:22:29.040 don't have any errors. Let's send a post
01:22:31.520 request to create something like an
01:22:35.280 income of let's say second
01:22:38.040 salary. Let's say
01:22:41.320 4,000. We can create it successfully.
01:22:43.840 Now let's try to get a transaction. I
01:22:46.800 mean get the transactions for a profile.
01:22:50.400 Um, looks like it failed. Let's
01:22:55.960 see. Res is not
01:22:59.480 defined. What do you mean? We sent a
01:23:03.440 request to API
01:23:07.639 transactions. Okay. So, here we need to
01:23:09.840 put the request and response. And again,
01:23:13.120 my thought process was we sent a
01:23:15.280 request. Let me just find it. It is the
01:23:17.440 get request to this endpoint. Let me
01:23:19.840 find the controller. We don't really
01:23:21.679 have the response. So let's paste this
01:23:24.040 in. Send the request. Now we can get the
01:23:28.239 response back. And we can try to delete
01:23:31.440 one. So I'll go ahead delete the one
01:23:33.840 with the ID of
01:23:36.120 four. So I'll put
01:23:38.920 ID4. It's been deleted. Let's put
01:23:41.360 something that we don't really have in
01:23:42.960 the database and put something that is
01:23:47.000 invalid. Okay, so everything is working
01:23:50.000 as expected. We can add something, get
01:23:52.239 them and let's get the summary as
01:23:55.880 well. Okay, so it is working completely
01:23:59.199 fine and we have just organized our
01:24:02.639 entire codebase, right? We have our
01:24:04.719 controller functions for the
01:24:06.520 transactions. We have our middleware
01:24:08.800 folder. We have the config. We have the
01:24:11.920 routes and server.js file looks a lot
01:24:14.800 more cleaner.
01:24:16.440 Right? And we can I think delete this
01:24:18.960 one as well. One of the conventions is
01:24:21.840 to have a route for the health check. So
01:24:24.960 you would basically say uh I don't know
01:24:27.760 maybe
01:24:29.400 API/alth or just health check or just
01:24:33.840 health you know something similar and
01:24:35.920 then you would send a response back. you
01:24:38.000 would uh send your request just to check
01:24:40.560 if your API is up and running. But in
01:24:43.120 this case, I'll just delete it to keep
01:24:44.960 it simple. And I think we can take this
01:24:48.480 function and put it right here under the
01:24:51.239 database. So here I'll paste this in and
01:24:54.239 let's say export this function and we
01:24:57.600 can call it right
01:24:59.239 here by importing it. We can delete the
01:25:02.400 SQL. We are not using it. It is coming
01:25:05.520 right here. Right. Open up the terminal.
01:25:08.400 Let's see. It is working as expected. If
01:25:11.120 we try to break this. So, I'll try to
01:25:14.239 break
01:25:16.199 that. You know, let's change the
01:25:18.920 password and save this file. Now,
01:25:22.159 authentication failed. But if we put the
01:25:24.400 correct one, everything is working as
01:25:26.159 expected. All right. So, with that, I
01:25:28.320 think that's going to for the entire
01:25:30.400 backend part where we have built the
01:25:32.480 entire API. We even implemented
01:25:34.960 something called rate limiting. Um, I
01:25:37.360 hope you enjoyed the entire section. In
01:25:39.120 the next one, we're going to get started
01:25:40.800 with the React Native mobile
01:25:42.679 application. So, I'll see you there. So,
01:25:45.120 I already said goodbye, but just a
01:25:47.360 second. I'd like to do one more quick
01:25:49.400 optimization where I'd like to take
01:25:51.679 everything that is related to
01:25:53.120 application and put it under a folder
01:25:55.760 called source. So, if you have ever used
01:25:58.320 React, Nex.js JS or any other production
01:26:01.520 grade framework. Uh probably you have
01:26:04.000 seen this folder, right? The entire
01:26:06.000 application logic is within this folder.
01:26:09.040 So this is what I'd like to do. I'll
01:26:10.880 just get the config controllers
01:26:13.120 middleware routes but not the node
01:26:15.840 modules. So let me first grab all of
01:26:18.159 these and put it under the source. I'll
01:26:21.440 do the same thing for the routes. And
01:26:23.679 finally the server.js file. So these are
01:26:26.960 the actual application logic but things
01:26:29.840 like you know package JSON orv file or
01:26:33.520 you know our dependencies could be
01:26:35.840 outside of this folder. So this is just
01:26:38.080 a commission that I wanted to follow.
01:26:40.320 But if you open up the terminal you'll
01:26:42.560 see that it's going to crash. It's
01:26:44.560 because here we said just go ahead run
01:26:47.040 the server.js file but now it is not
01:26:50.400 really right here right it is under the
01:26:52.639 source. So we'll say now it is under the
01:26:55.679 source folder. Save this and kill this
01:26:58.960 and re restart it. Now it is working
01:27:02.400 correctly. And I'll add one more script.
01:27:05.120 So this is something for the production.
01:27:08.000 Here I'll just say run the server.js JS
01:27:10.719 file but uh with the node right in
01:27:14.320 development we would like to run it with
01:27:16.000 nodemon but in the production we'll just
01:27:18.880 run it with
01:27:20.760 node which is something that uh which is
01:27:23.840 something that is not going to listen
01:27:25.760 for the changes. Okay. So this is
01:27:27.760 something that we'll be using when we
01:27:29.440 deploy this API. Okay. I think that's
01:27:32.880 going to uh under the main. This is one
01:27:35.520 more optimization that we could add. I
01:27:37.520 just feel like this section is never
01:27:39.600 going to end. But here we go. The
01:27:42.080 starter file is not index.js. In our
01:27:44.880 case, it is server.js, right? And it is
01:27:48.000 under the source folder. So, let's go
01:27:50.480 ahead uh add this. And now everything
01:27:53.600 should be working correctly. Okay. So,
01:27:56.719 that's going to be it for this section.
01:27:58.159 I'll see you in the next one. All right.
01:28:00.480 So finally we can get started with the
01:28:02.800 mobile folder where we can initialize
01:28:05.199 our React Native application. Currently
01:28:07.440 we don't really have anything and before
01:28:09.760 we write any code I'd like to you know
01:28:12.239 just give you a quick crash course on
01:28:14.320 React Native. So these are the things
01:28:16.159 that I have explained in my previous
01:28:18.000 tutorials but just in case if you are
01:28:20.159 new here I'd like to go over it pretty
01:28:22.800 quickly. Okay so you might be asking
01:28:25.040 what is React Native in the first place.
01:28:27.440 It is a framework that allows you to
01:28:29.600 build mobile applications using React.
01:28:32.320 So that's it. It is just a framework
01:28:34.719 that allows you to build mobile
01:28:36.400 applications using React. You can use
01:28:39.120 either JavaScript or TypeScript. And
01:28:41.760 there is a really common term called
01:28:44.080 crossplatform development, which means
01:28:46.880 writing code once that can run on
01:28:49.280 multiple platforms. And this is exactly
01:28:51.840 what React Native allows you to allows
01:28:54.320 you to do. uh because it is a
01:28:56.280 cross-platform framework. Sorry, it's a
01:28:59.040 cross-platform framework because you can
01:29:01.440 write one codebase in JavaScript and you
01:29:04.080 can deploy it to both iOS and Android.
01:29:07.440 So, this is exactly what we'll be doing.
01:29:09.679 We'll just write one codebase in
01:29:11.520 JavaScript and it'll work both on iOS
01:29:14.400 and Android. And it can even work in web
01:29:18.080 thanks to Expo, which is something that
01:29:20.400 we'll get into. But this wasn't really
01:29:22.639 the case back in the old days. So if you
01:29:25.920 want to build a mobile application, you
01:29:28.480 had to build it. You had to build it
01:29:30.639 twice. So one for the app store and then
01:29:33.600 one for the play store. And assuming you
01:29:37.199 don't really know any of these
01:29:38.239 languages, it would be really slow
01:29:40.400 because you first had to learn Swift,
01:29:42.719 build it. Once it is done, just go back
01:29:45.040 and learn Cotlin uh and you know, build
01:29:48.000 it, deploy it, so on and so forth. It
01:29:50.239 was really expensive as a founder as
01:29:52.480 well because you had to hire two
01:29:55.280 different engineering teams,
01:29:57.639 right? One team would build this uh part
01:30:00.880 of the app and then the other one this
01:30:03.600 app. So it's like really cumbersome and
01:30:06.080 expensive and before CIFT I think there
01:30:08.880 was objective C like sift is a little
01:30:12.239 bit more simplified version of it. I
01:30:14.480 have never used any of them but these
01:30:16.480 are the things that I have just
01:30:17.600 researched and you know just keep that
01:30:20.080 in mind and then before cotlin you had
01:30:22.320 to build it with java you can still do
01:30:24.800 it but I think cotlin is a little bit
01:30:26.880 more abstract like abstraction on top of
01:30:29.280 it um yeah so I think developers mostly
01:30:33.360 let's say they prefer this over
01:30:36.600 java and then if you wanted to build it
01:30:39.280 with you know if you wanted to build it
01:30:41.600 for the app store you have to have a
01:30:43.840 MacBook which is to be honest pretty
01:30:46.400 expensive. But now thanks to React
01:30:48.639 Native, you can just skip everything and
01:30:50.960 just learn JavaScript and build it which
01:30:53.360 is pretty cool. And there is something
01:30:55.120 called Expo on top of it which is
01:30:57.520 something that React Native teams I mean
01:31:00.000 React Native team uh recommends. So this
01:31:03.120 is a screenshot from their documentation
01:31:05.440 that you can take a look as well. So
01:31:07.600 just check out the ReactNative.dev. This
01:31:10.560 is the entire documentation for React
01:31:12.400 Native. Uh so they basically say that
01:31:15.600 they believe the best way to experience
01:31:17.760 React Native is through a framework and
01:31:21.120 their optional choice is Expo which is
01:31:23.760 something that we'll be using. It's
01:31:25.280 incredible. We'll just see it for in
01:31:27.440 this tutorial. Okay. So our go framework
01:31:29.920 for React Native is Expo. But now don't
01:31:32.639 get confused. React Native is not the
01:31:35.120 same thing as Expo. So Expo is built on
01:31:38.560 top of React Native. Okay. So it is like
01:31:40.960 additional toolbox that we have that
01:31:43.280 makes react native development a lot
01:31:45.360 more easier and we'll see that as I
01:31:48.199 said. So it's like Nex.js that is built
01:31:51.440 on top of react in web development
01:31:53.760 right. So you get additional
01:31:55.520 optimizations like let's say server site
01:31:58.320 rendering uh server actions, SEO
01:32:01.280 optimizations, image optimizations,
01:32:03.760 links, so on and so forth, right? We
01:32:05.679 could just talk about it for hours, but
01:32:08.960 let's move on. So here I just put five
01:32:11.360 different comparisons that you can take
01:32:13.199 a look. Like I think there is nothing to
01:32:15.760 explain. Just pause the video and take a
01:32:17.760 look at it even though I'll I'll go over
01:32:20.000 it. So this is the web react. Okay, so
01:32:22.960 this is just ReactJS and this is React
01:32:24.960 Native. So the component structure is
01:32:27.679 exactly the same, but instead of having
01:32:30.000 divs and H1 and P, we have like Wu and
01:32:33.760 text. So it doesn't really matter if you
01:32:35.920 use H1, P, you know, span, uh, let's say
01:32:40.080 H6, H3, any kind of text, it should go
01:32:43.840 under the text component, which is
01:32:46.480 coming from React Native. And div is
01:32:49.120 just a view. Okay, so we just have view
01:32:51.760 for
01:32:52.679 boxes. Okay, so we'll just get into it a
01:32:55.280 lot in the like a lot more in the coding
01:32:58.000 like in a couple of minutes. But these
01:32:59.760 are some examples to keep in mind. And
01:33:02.159 when it comes to styling here in web, we
01:33:05.760 would have a class name and then uh
01:33:08.400 define it in our CSS file, right? So we
01:33:11.120 have like card class with some padding,
01:33:13.679 border radius, etc. And then we put it
01:33:16.320 right here. But instead in React Native
01:33:19.040 we create a stylesheet. Okay. So just
01:33:21.280 import it, create a styles object where
01:33:24.800 you have your classes. So cart is
01:33:27.280 basically an object. You would give the
01:33:29.199 padding all the styles and then just
01:33:31.840 come back to here and say styles.cart.
01:33:34.880 We're just going to apply these styles
01:33:37.280 to this view. So same for this one. So
01:33:39.679 on and so
01:33:41.480 forth. Let's see what do we have else.
01:33:45.040 The event handling. Okay. So we don't
01:33:46.880 really have a button in React Native. We
01:33:49.360 have things like touchable opacity or
01:33:52.000 pressable which are the equivalent of a
01:33:54.480 button right and on web we have like on
01:33:57.760 click on mouse over uh but since in
01:34:01.040 mobile development we don't really have
01:34:02.639 a mouse there are events like on press
01:34:05.760 on long press so on and so
01:34:08.040 forth. Okay so we have lists. So in
01:34:12.000 React you would do something like
01:34:14.480 array.mmap and for each item you would
01:34:17.760 you know render something. This is
01:34:19.600 something that you can do in react
01:34:21.199 native as well but uh the better option
01:34:24.080 is to use something called flat list. It
01:34:27.280 has a lot more optimization on top of
01:34:30.480 this usage. Okay. So this is something
01:34:32.880 that we'll be using as well. Just keep
01:34:34.960 that in mind. you would say here is my
01:34:37.199 item sorry here's my array and for each
01:34:40.080 item go over and run uh this function.
01:34:44.159 So it'll basically take every single
01:34:46.159 item and return this part. Okay, so this
01:34:49.600 might look a little bit weird but we'll
01:34:51.120 see that in the tutorial in the incoming
01:34:54.080 sections. And then finally we have the
01:34:56.400 forms. So instead of a input right
01:34:59.600 instead of an input we have text input
01:35:02.239 component which is almost the exact same
01:35:04.480 thing. with some syntax differences and
01:35:07.600 we don't really have a form element. So
01:35:10.239 in web we have on submit but here
01:35:12.719 basically when we click to the button we
01:35:15.120 would just submit that. Okay. So these
01:35:17.440 are just some examples that I wanted to
01:35:20.239 put here so that you can just get a bit
01:35:22.679 motivated that react is not really
01:35:25.520 different than react native or vice
01:35:27.760 versa. There are just some syntax
01:35:29.679 differences and a couple of different uh
01:35:32.400 let's say concepts, right? Okay. Now,
01:35:35.920 how are you going to follow along with
01:35:37.679 this tutorial? Let's try to go over it
01:35:39.840 pretty quickly. So, basically, you have
01:35:42.080 two different options. Uh you can either
01:35:44.719 install Expo on your phone, right? So,
01:35:47.280 this is a screenshot that I took. So,
01:35:49.520 you you could install it from either App
01:35:51.679 Store or Play Store and then scan a QR
01:35:55.199 code. This is something that we'll see
01:35:56.880 in a second. Or you could install a
01:35:59.360 simulator on your machine. So if you're
01:36:01.760 using Windows, you can install Android
01:36:03.840 Studio. And if you're on Mac, you can
01:36:06.000 use Xcode. Like this will take a little
01:36:08.639 bit longer because you're installing a
01:36:11.199 huge simulator. But if you want to get
01:36:14.159 started pretty quickly, you can install
01:36:16.080 the XOGO application. It'll just be
01:36:18.400 installed in like couple of minutes. And
01:36:21.120 here, as I said, this is really quick
01:36:22.800 and convenient to get started with, but
01:36:25.600 this is a lot more slower and this could
01:36:28.639 be pretty cool if you are going to build
01:36:30.960 more applications in the future, right?
01:36:33.199 In the long run, it could be fun because
01:36:35.600 you would just have your simulator in
01:36:37.920 your laptop. So, you don't really need
01:36:39.920 to check your phone every single time.
01:36:42.400 So, in either case, you are going to
01:36:44.000 build the application. So I think I
01:36:45.920 would recommend you to go with this
01:36:47.679 option to be Ela fast but it's
01:36:49.840 completely up to you. In this video I'll
01:36:51.760 be using the simulator so that I can
01:36:54.080 just show you the output as we go. Okay.
01:36:56.560 So let's go ahead and get started with
01:36:58.320 the actual application. I'll open up the
01:37:01.440 terminal. Now I just killed the back end
01:37:03.360 for now. We don't really need it. So
01:37:05.119 I'll cd into the mobile folder and I'll
01:37:08.080 say mpx
01:37:12.760 create-expo@ latest and we're going to
01:37:15.360 put dot at the end. So we'll be using
01:37:17.600 expo for the you know initialization. Uh
01:37:20.800 like as I said it it is the let's just
01:37:23.840 go through it pretty quickly. I think I
01:37:25.760 haven't really talked about it expo
01:37:27.679 enough. So it is the framework that is
01:37:30.719 built on top of React Native and it's
01:37:33.440 like all the toolbox all the necessary
01:37:35.600 APIs that would let you to build a
01:37:38.800 production ready application and you can
01:37:41.040 take a look at the entire documentation.
01:37:43.520 They actually have a pretty cool uh
01:37:45.840 tutorial right here within the
01:37:47.560 documentation but uh in this video I'd
01:37:50.239 like to walk you through it. Okay. So
01:37:52.239 we'll just run this command to
01:37:53.920 initialize the expo app.
01:37:59.520 So this is going to get you a
01:38:02.400 boilerplate expo application and we're
01:38:05.199 going to go ahead delete everything and
01:38:06.880 just get started from
01:38:08.920 scratch. Okay, so it's done. Now this is
01:38:11.920 pretty much a React codebase. So we have
01:38:14.880 things like components, we have custom
01:38:17.119 hooks, we have some constants. So these
01:38:19.679 are the colors, but we're going to
01:38:21.040 change it and build it from scratch. So,
01:38:23.199 it's it should be pretty uh let's say
01:38:25.440 pretty uh familiar to you, but we'll
01:38:28.480 delete everything and get started from
01:38:30.400 scratch. But first, I'd like to just run
01:38:32.719 this app on my simulator. Okay. So, I'll
01:38:35.280 just put them side by side. Now, let's
01:38:37.840 say clear the terminal and MPX Expo.
01:38:41.679 Now, in a second, I'll show you how to
01:38:43.679 run this on your physical device. But
01:38:46.320 first, now if you're on iOS or if you're
01:38:49.600 on Mac, just press I. But if you are on
01:38:52.000 Windows, press A. So I'll press I. It's
01:38:55.360 going to get started with
01:38:58.119 it. Okay. So this is the boilerplate
01:39:00.960 application that Expo gives you. We'll
01:39:03.119 delete everything and get started from
01:39:04.880 scratch. But first, let me open up the
01:39:07.320 camera and show you how to open this up
01:39:11.199 on your phone. So I have both an Android
01:39:14.239 device and an iOS device. So first,
01:39:16.880 let's just from here say scan the QR
01:39:19.600 code. I'll click to it. In here, we
01:39:22.239 should be able to have a, you know, QR
01:39:24.719 code that I'd like to scan pretty
01:39:28.360 quickly. Okay, now it is building the
01:39:31.360 application. We're going to get the
01:39:33.040 exact same output that we have right
01:39:35.960 here. Okay, let's do the exact same
01:39:38.159 thing on my, you know, iOS
01:39:42.679 device just to double check it is
01:39:45.040 working correctly.
01:39:48.159 Okay. So, if you don't have the uh iOS
01:39:50.719 simulator, you can follow along with
01:39:52.880 your actual phone. Okay. Now, let's try
01:39:55.600 to update something. So, here I'll go
01:39:58.000 ahead update this welcome text which is
01:40:00.239 under the app tabs and index. So, we'll
01:40:03.440 delete everything and explain
01:40:05.000 everything. Do not worry at the moment.
01:40:07.520 Here I'll say welcome one 2 3 let's say.
01:40:11.520 And once I save, notice how it'll be
01:40:14.679 updated. Okay. So that means everything
01:40:17.199 is working correctly. Um I'll delete
01:40:20.000 these applications, right? I'll just
01:40:21.920 kill them and instead I would like to uh
01:40:25.600 explain it from the simulator so that we
01:40:28.080 can see it side by
01:40:30.520 side. Okay. So now that you know how you
01:40:33.280 can follow along with your phone, let me
01:40:35.920 maximize this and just zoom out a bit.
01:40:38.159 So there is so much like so much going
01:40:40.480 on at the moment. what we would like to
01:40:42.400 do just delete everything and get
01:40:44.320 started from scratch. And thankfully
01:40:46.960 React Native the expo expo team gives
01:40:50.080 you a script where you can reset the
01:40:52.239 project. So these are the things that we
01:40:54.400 don't really understand at the moment.
01:40:56.400 So that's why I'll go ahead kill the
01:40:58.639 application with Ctrl C and then I'll
01:41:01.119 say mpm run reset-
01:41:04.840 project. So this will basically reset
01:41:07.440 the project. And here it ask me it asks
01:41:10.719 me a question where it says do you want
01:41:13.520 me to delete everything or should I take
01:41:16.000 everything and put it a folder called
01:41:19.320 app-ample. So I'll just say press enter.
01:41:22.719 So it'll take everything that we had and
01:41:24.639 it'll put it under the app-le folder.
01:41:27.760 Right? So we had the components
01:41:30.239 constants hooks. But for now, I'd like
01:41:32.880 to ignore this and take a look at the
01:41:35.639 index.tsx
01:41:37.159 file with a super basic content. So,
01:41:41.040 I'll just run the app once
01:41:43.800 again. So, let's say MPX expo and I'll
01:41:47.040 say just press I. Let's put them side by
01:41:50.880 side and go over it. Now, this is the
01:41:52.960 old version. I'll press R to reload
01:41:57.000 it. Here we can see it says reload the
01:41:59.440 app. Now this is the this is the output.
01:42:01.920 Now I'd like to go a little bit slowly
01:42:04.239 at the beginning, right? So I'll just go
01:42:06.000 really slowly just to make sure we
01:42:08.159 understand the fundamentals and then we
01:42:10.800 can speed up the process. Okay. So
01:42:13.440 everything starts from the app folder
01:42:16.000 and specifically from the layout file.
01:42:18.960 So this is a special file called
01:42:20.960 underscore layout. It's using TypeScript
01:42:24.159 but in this tutorial we'll be using
01:42:25.679 JavaScript just to keep it beginner
01:42:27.840 friendly. So here they have something
01:42:30.159 called stack navigator. I'll explain
01:42:32.560 this but for now let's go into the
01:42:34.960 homepage which is called
01:42:37.159 index.tsx. Again a special file name.
01:42:40.080 Okay. So this is the homepage the home
01:42:42.080 screen that you would have. Now let's
01:42:44.159 try to change
01:42:46.520 something. Save. It's been updated.
01:42:49.360 Okay. Now let's get started with some
01:42:51.760 components. So we said that view is
01:42:54.239 equivalent of dev, right? It is just a
01:42:57.199 simple box. And then we have some
01:42:59.600 styles. So here, let's say the
01:43:01.760 background color is going to be
01:43:04.400 something like red. It'll be updated. So
01:43:07.600 this is how you would add some styles.
01:43:09.600 There are different ways that we'll see.
01:43:11.760 You could either put it like uh inline.
01:43:14.159 Let's do it actually on this one. So you
01:43:16.400 would say style, open up this object,
01:43:18.880 and you would say color. Let's say I'll
01:43:21.520 say it'll be blue. Okay, it's been
01:43:24.320 updated. I don't really know if you can
01:43:26.080 see it, but it's definitely blue. And
01:43:29.520 then let's try to put a component like a
01:43:32.639 link. Let's say it'll take us to the
01:43:35.280 about screen, which is something that we
01:43:37.360 don't have, but we'll create it. Now,
01:43:40.400 for the link, you have either expo
01:43:42.159 router, right? Link coming from export
01:43:44.400 router or react navigation. I would
01:43:46.560 recommend you to use expo. It is a lot
01:43:48.480 better than the other one. So, let's say
01:43:51.360 href. Once we click to it, it'll take us
01:43:54.239 to the about page. But we don't really
01:43:56.320 have this one. So let's try to create
01:43:58.239 it. I'll say about
01:44:02.040 jsx. Now I'll use a snippet called
01:44:06.119 rnf which which is going to give you a
01:44:08.800 react native functional component. And
01:44:11.199 let's say this will be called as about.
01:44:14.320 Now if you cannot get this snippet, you
01:44:16.719 can install this extension.
01:44:21.199 Um just go ahead and install this one
01:44:23.119 and you can say things like
01:44:25.960 rnf and you can get the exact same
01:44:28.320 output that I have. Okay, let's save and
01:44:31.199 try
01:44:32.040 to save this file as well. Now it says
01:44:34.880 we cannot see it but it's actually
01:44:37.600 there. I'll refresh this. I'll say R to
01:44:40.639 reload
01:44:42.600 this. Now I'll click it. We can go into
01:44:45.920 that page. So if you if you're getting
01:44:48.320 this error probably VS Code is buggy.
01:44:50.800 Just press
01:44:52.199 commandshiftp or control shiftp and say
01:44:55.199 developer reload
01:44:57.159 window. So this is a pro tip that you
01:44:59.760 can keep in mind. But looks like this
01:45:02.000 does not work. Let's try to make
01:45:04.320 everything
01:45:07.320 JSX. Let's say yes. And I'll update this
01:45:10.560 one as well. Let's go with a
01:45:13.400 JavaScript. Save this file and close
01:45:15.520 that as well. Okay, now we don't really
01:45:17.040 have any errors. But now as you can tell
01:45:20.159 the navigation is working. Now if you
01:45:23.280 can see this is what we call the stack
01:45:25.320 navigator. So when you click to it new
01:45:27.840 pages will be coming from the right hand
01:45:29.840 side and the previous pages will go from
01:45:33.040 the left hand side. Right? So this feels
01:45:35.440 like a stack and this is possible thanks
01:45:38.719 to this component that we just put in
01:45:41.199 into the root layout. So almost always
01:45:43.920 you would like to have this component in
01:45:45.920 your applications unless you are
01:45:47.920 building only a single page mobile app.
01:45:51.840 Okay. So we're going to have that right
01:45:56.199 here. And now you might be asking I
01:45:58.800 don't really want to see this screen
01:46:00.880 header right. So it's really basic
01:46:03.280 really simple to get rid of. We'll go
01:46:05.199 under this tag. We'll say screen options
01:46:08.159 where we would like to say the header
01:46:10.239 shown is going to be equal to false
01:46:12.719 save. Now it is gone. Okay. So this is
01:46:14.880 something that you can keep in mind in
01:46:16.639 your notes. But in this case I'd like to
01:46:18.960 have it. But in this case it is
01:46:20.639 something that I'd like to have it. So
01:46:22.159 I'll just delete that. Now let's see
01:46:23.920 another component. So here I'll just say
01:46:26.239 the image component. Again use the one
01:46:28.719 that is coming from expo image. It's a
01:46:30.800 lot more optimized. Here we can put the
01:46:33.119 source. Now, this could be either a
01:46:35.360 local image or a remote image. So, let's
01:46:38.159 see what I mean. I'll just put the URI
01:46:40.800 and let's grab an image from
01:46:43.639 Unsplash. Okay. So, I'll just get this
01:46:45.920 keyboard image. Let's say copy the image
01:46:49.920 address or link address. What should we
01:46:52.080 do? I'll just say copy the link
01:46:55.400 address. I'll paste this in. Let's put
01:46:57.840 them side by side. Now if I save I
01:47:00.320 cannot see anything because we don't
01:47:01.920 really have any width or height. So
01:47:04.080 let's say
01:47:07.320 style let's put the width I'll say 100.
01:47:10.960 And let's do the same thing for
01:47:15.480 height. Okay. So for some reason we
01:47:18.080 cannot still see that. I think we should
01:47:20.800 get the image address. So here I'll say
01:47:23.119 copy the image address instead of
01:47:29.480 link. Okay, now we can see it. So you
01:47:32.480 would use URI if you want to get a
01:47:35.360 remote image. But let's say you want to
01:47:37.520 get this local image from the images. Uh
01:47:41.280 let's say you would like to get the
01:47:42.719 React
01:47:43.880 logo.png. So here instead of this I'll
01:47:46.560 comment this out for the reference.
01:47:49.360 Let's say you would create the image
01:47:51.199 component once
01:47:52.600 again. Now for the source you would like
01:47:55.760 to import it. So here I'll say
01:47:58.360 require I'll put at which means you are
01:48:01.119 in the root. Okay. So you are in the
01:48:03.360 mobile folder. From here we'll go under
01:48:05.840 the assets. Let's say /
01:48:09.239 assets. Go under the images and then get
01:48:12.639 the react
01:48:17.480 logo.png. And of course, I'd like to get
01:48:19.840 my styles. So, let's paste this in.
01:48:22.239 Okay. So, we can import that as well. It
01:48:24.239 is working correctly. So, these are the
01:48:26.400 things that you can keep in mind. I
01:48:28.719 think we'll be using we'll be using them
01:48:30.719 later in the
01:48:32.119 video. So, I know that we are going
01:48:34.400 slowly, but I really want to make sure
01:48:36.320 that you understand the basics. So,
01:48:38.480 let's give another example. I'll create
01:48:40.880 a view. Basically, it is a div. If you
01:48:43.440 put some text like hello, what do you
01:48:46.000 think will happen? Well, I think we'll
01:48:48.159 get an error. Let's save. As we can
01:48:50.639 tell, whenever you have a text, it has
01:48:53.520 to be under the text component. So, here
01:48:56.080 I'll just put text. And now, let's say
01:48:58.639 hello. Save. The error is gone. Now, you
01:49:01.679 might be asking, hey, we had a text here
01:49:04.159 under the link, but it is not wrapped
01:49:06.400 with a text component. Well, if you
01:49:08.960 hover over the link, they will tell you
01:49:11.119 that we are wrapping it under a text
01:49:14.080 component by default so that you don't
01:49:16.320 have to. Okay. So, even though it looks
01:49:18.480 like we don't have it, like we
01:49:20.960 definitely have that under the hood. So,
01:49:23.360 this is one more thing that you can keep
01:49:25.040 in mind otherwise you'll get like you'll
01:49:29.199 get errors just like this one. Okay. So,
01:49:31.679 let's delete this view. And other thing
01:49:33.920 that I'd like to talk about is the
01:49:35.960 styles here. I'll go ahead create a
01:49:39.600 let's say we'll create an object I'll
01:49:41.440 say post styles this is the convention
01:49:44.239 most of the time this is what we call it
01:49:46.400 we'll say from the stylesheet so just
01:49:49.440 import that from react
01:49:51.560 native let's do it style sheet here we
01:49:55.040 would like to create one not compose
01:49:58.000 let's say create and we'll pass an
01:50:00.639 object so here let's say I want to call
01:50:03.280 this as the container class right so I
01:50:06.480 can say container container and put
01:50:08.239 these styles in which is flex of one and
01:50:11.679 let me copy and paste the rest. Okay,
01:50:14.880 now instead of putting it in line I'll
01:50:16.800 say delete this and grab it from the
01:50:19.199 styles. So I'll say styles container.
01:50:22.159 Okay, now let's save everything is going
01:50:24.400 to be the same. Here you can add more
01:50:26.400 things like background color is going to
01:50:29.360 be let's say purple. It's going to be
01:50:32.320 updated. That means these styles are
01:50:34.960 actually being updated, right? They are
01:50:37.040 being applied. So you can do the same
01:50:38.880 thing for the rest. Just cut this out
01:50:41.520 from here. I'll say styles dot let's say
01:50:46.080 I don't know let's say
01:50:49.480 heading. You would go ahead create this
01:50:52.159 one. Uh let's say font size is going to
01:50:55.920 be something like huge, right? And let's
01:50:59.040 say color is going to be blue as well.
01:51:03.199 Okay, as you can tell, these are the
01:51:04.960 things that you would do. This is a
01:51:06.800 different way of using it. Now, this is
01:51:08.800 really cool actually because if you
01:51:11.600 think about it, you will have like 20
01:51:14.159 lines of code for a single class, right?
01:51:17.119 For a single style. And if you put
01:51:20.040 it right here in line, so let's pretty
01:51:22.639 quickly do it. Imagine you have this one
01:51:25.840 like at some point this component will
01:51:27.840 be really really ugly because here you
01:51:30.159 will have another 20 lines of code right
01:51:33.199 here you would have maybe 50 lines of
01:51:35.360 code so everything would be styles
01:51:37.440 instead of doing it in this way we would
01:51:39.440 create our own object and we can even
01:51:42.320 take it put it into a different file so
01:51:44.880 that we don't really we don't really
01:51:46.960 have to see any styles in the JSX file.
01:51:50.480 So I just did some Ctrl Z and bring this
01:51:52.880 back to the previous state. Now I think
01:51:55.440 we can leave this section here. Let's
01:51:57.440 talk about the app.json file as well.
01:52:00.320 This is the configuration file for your
01:52:02.960 mobile app. Here we can see like we have
01:52:05.360 the entire expo configuration. You have
01:52:07.920 your icon for Android you know for web.
01:52:10.880 These are the things that you would have
01:52:12.880 and then let's say for the iOS you know
01:52:16.400 for plugins like everything right this
01:52:19.440 is the configuration file most of the
01:52:21.599 time you don't really work with it but
01:52:23.520 once you once you're about to deploy
01:52:26.080 this app to Apple store or play store I
01:52:29.280 think this is the this is the file that
01:52:30.880 you would be updating now one more thing
01:52:33.440 if you press W it's going to open up
01:52:36.719 this application on
01:52:38.440 web okay so you can just put it into the
01:52:42.320 web view, right? So, you just shrink the
01:52:45.199 screen and you can test this out or you
01:52:47.360 can build a web application with Expo.
01:52:50.560 But we are not really interested with
01:52:52.159 this option. So, we'll move on with the
01:52:54.400 mobile phone that we have, right? So,
01:52:56.639 I'll leave this section here. We just
01:52:58.480 learned the basics of React Native,
01:53:00.719 right? In the incoming sections, we can
01:53:02.960 get started with the authentication so
01:53:05.119 on and so forth. Maybe just one more
01:53:06.960 thing I could explain pretty quickly.
01:53:09.520 Now there is something called tab
01:53:11.440 navigator. So this is an example that I
01:53:13.920 have. So if you can see at the very
01:53:16.000 bottom of this file or at the bottom of
01:53:18.320 this pawn right here we have couple of
01:53:21.599 different tabs. Whenever you click to
01:53:23.679 one of them the UI will update. So this
01:53:25.920 is what we call the tab navigator right.
01:53:28.960 So, it is a navigation pattern that
01:53:31.520 creates a tap bar, usually at the bottom
01:53:34.400 of the screen that allows users to
01:53:37.679 switch between different screens. In
01:53:39.760 this application, we are not going to
01:53:41.199 have the tab navigation. As you can
01:53:43.679 tell, we don't really have this tab at
01:53:46.320 the bottom. Instead, we have the stack
01:53:48.760 navigator. But just to mention, if you
01:53:51.119 wanted to create a tab navigator under
01:53:53.920 the app folder, you would create this
01:53:56.159 special folder called tabs. and then you
01:53:58.880 would put your tabs within this folder.
01:54:01.760 This is something that we have done in
01:54:03.199 the previous React Native tutorials. You
01:54:05.760 can check them out. But in this video,
01:54:07.920 we'll not be using it. Okay? So, this is
01:54:10.480 something to keep in mind. Uh with that,
01:54:13.599 that's going to be it for this section.
01:54:14.960 I'll see you in the next one. Okay. So,
01:54:17.599 this is where we left. We just learned
01:54:19.280 the basics of React Native, but now it's
01:54:21.840 time to set up our codebase. So to keep
01:54:25.280 everything simple and a lot more easier
01:54:27.360 for the incoming sections, we can add
01:54:29.679 our CSS files, our colors, some images,
01:54:33.840 so on. Right? So here I have prepared an
01:54:36.560 entire GitHub gist. So just uh I'll just
01:54:39.520 put the link in the description. You can
01:54:41.040 find it. So here we'll have couple of
01:54:43.520 different CSS files that we would like
01:54:45.599 to copy and paste instead of typing them
01:54:48.000 out because this is not a CSS course.
01:54:50.560 really like to focus on the actual React
01:54:53.360 Native concepts. Right? So here we have
01:54:56.239 things like flex, background colors,
01:54:58.960 paddings, you know, width, height, super
01:55:01.360 super basic CSS. So in this case, I'd
01:55:04.000 like to just copy and paste those. Here
01:55:06.560 I'll copy the very first file which is
01:55:09.040 for the oath. So here I'll go ahead
01:55:11.280 paste this in under the let's say mobile
01:55:15.159 create the styles folder under the
01:55:19.480 assets and then create this file called
01:55:23.800 oath.styles.js. So I'll go ahead paste
01:55:25.760 this in 100 lines of code. We'll be
01:55:28.239 using them. So these are basically the
01:55:30.320 class names that you would need to get a
01:55:33.119 beautiful output like these ones. So
01:55:36.080 this is the you know styles for the oath
01:55:38.719 pages and then we have the homepage as
01:55:41.119 well as the create page and then we are
01:55:43.280 going to need some colors so that I can
01:55:45.599 give you all these different themes. So
01:55:48.639 we have the coffee theme, we have the
01:55:50.880 purple theme, the green and then the
01:55:53.679 blue ocean theme. Right? So for this
01:55:56.320 once again you can find the colors.js
01:55:58.800 file. Go ahead copy it. Again I'll
01:56:02.159 explain how this works.
01:56:04.560 just put it under the
01:56:06.280 constants. So here under the mobile
01:56:09.280 create the constants and then let's say
01:56:13.159 colors.js file paste this in. So
01:56:17.280 basically we have let's say four
01:56:19.760 different themes right they have the
01:56:21.599 exact same thing like primary background
01:56:24.719 so on and so forth but the values are
01:56:27.040 different. And then at the very bottom
01:56:29.440 we have this themes object. If it is
01:56:32.000 coffee, it'll use the coffee theme. If
01:56:34.560 it is forest, we'll use the forest
01:56:37.440 theme. So on and so forth. And then
01:56:39.440 here, this is the actual colors. Let's
01:56:42.159 say you would like to use the coffee
01:56:43.679 theme. Here you would just say, give me
01:56:46.159 the coffee. If you would like to use the
01:56:47.840 ocean theme, you would put this and your
01:56:50.560 application will change the theme. And
01:56:53.040 you will see this. By default, I'd like
01:56:55.599 to go with the coffee theme. Okay. So
01:56:58.159 just save that. and under the oath
01:57:00.159 styles here we can see for the colors we
01:57:02.960 are just grabbing them from the colors
01:57:05.639 object. Okay, so this is a pretty basic
01:57:08.800 JavaScript trick that we almost always
01:57:11.360 do when it comes to themes and then I'll
01:57:14.560 create the
01:57:16.840 homestyles.js file and then let's create
01:57:20.480 the create styles.js file as well. Let's
01:57:24.320 try to copy and paste
01:57:27.719 them. So, this is the create page.
01:57:30.320 Pretty long, but that's
01:57:33.400 fine. Paste this in. And that's it. Now,
01:57:37.280 we'll get the exact same
01:57:39.560 thing. So, this is another thing we'll
01:57:42.000 get into a bit later in the video, but
01:57:44.320 for now, just get the home
01:57:49.719 styles. Okay. So super super basic CSS.
01:57:53.840 Again, please don't get like don't get
01:57:56.159 mad. This is super basic CSS and I just
01:57:59.040 assume you already know this. So we have
01:58:01.119 things like width, height, legs, flex
01:58:03.280 direction, you know, colors, nothing to
01:58:05.920 explain. Otherwise, this tutorial would
01:58:07.840 be too many hours and we don't really
01:58:09.760 want to have something like that.
01:58:11.760 Finally, I'll create one more thing
01:58:14.239 under the let me see I think under the
01:58:16.960 library. So I'll create the lib and I'll
01:58:20.000 say utils.js file here. We'll just have
01:58:23.760 a utility function a helper function
01:58:26.960 that will basically format the date. So
01:58:30.239 we'll copy that paste this in. This is
01:58:32.400 something that we'll use later in the
01:58:33.920 video. Basically we're going to get the
01:58:36.000 date from our database which is in this
01:58:38.320 format and we would like to convert it
01:58:40.320 to be in this format. Right? So let me
01:58:42.719 pretty quickly display this is what we
01:58:45.119 have in the database. This is the format
01:58:47.920 and then this is what actually we want
01:58:50.320 to see the formatted version of
01:58:53.000 it. Okay. So it'll be possible thanks to
01:58:56.400 this function. And then very last thing
01:58:59.920 will be the images. So I have generated
01:59:02.800 these images with the help of AI with
01:59:05.840 chat GPT. So I paid $20 per month just
01:59:09.199 to create this image for you guys as
01:59:11.280 well as this icon. So let's try to
01:59:13.760 actually get those. So I'll provide them
01:59:16.320 for free. Let me just find the GitHub
01:59:18.639 repo for that. I think it is this one.
01:59:21.599 You can find the link in the
01:59:22.800 description. Currently it is private but
01:59:25.280 while you're watching it'll be
01:59:27.400 free. And I have even added some
01:59:30.159 different variations. So you can use any
01:59:32.560 of them that you wish. So this is
01:59:34.159 something that I'll not be using but I
01:59:36.080 just created that in case you want to
01:59:38.159 use it. So, we have all of
01:59:42.360 these and I think we are missing this
01:59:45.280 icon, this logo. Let me upload it as
01:59:48.080 well. All right. So, I just uploaded
01:59:49.679 that one as well. Just go ahead and
01:59:51.760 install them. And we would like to put
01:59:53.520 them under the assets folder. So, here
01:59:57.040 under the images, I'll just go ahead and
01:59:59.520 put them. Okay. So, I just pasted all of
02:00:01.840 these. I got the logo and then four
02:00:04.320 different illustrations that I called
02:00:06.480 I1, I2 all the way up to
02:00:09.000 four. Okay, so I think that's going to
02:00:11.280 be it for this quick setup section where
02:00:14.000 we just got the images, the colors, and
02:00:16.080 then the styles. I think we can delete
02:00:18.320 everything at the moment. I'll just get
02:00:20.159 rid of the styles. Let's just for now
02:00:23.119 put a text without any styling. And
02:00:27.360 actually, before we end the section, I'd
02:00:29.199 like to show you something else here.
02:00:31.280 Here I'll delete everything and notice
02:00:33.360 how we are going to get an error. First
02:00:35.440 let me do Ctrl + Z pretty quickly. So
02:00:37.840 under the container we had these
02:00:39.800 classes. I'd like
02:00:41.800 to just delete everything but leave this
02:00:45.360 container
02:00:46.840 class. Okay. So let me put them side by
02:00:51.480 side and reload my application. I'll
02:00:54.400 press
02:00:56.280 R. Okay. So if we delete the flex one,
02:00:59.760 notice how what'll happen. Actually,
02:01:01.520 I'll delete
02:01:03.400 everything and maybe we could get rid of
02:01:06.599 the say screen options. The screen
02:01:10.239 header I should say let's say show
02:01:15.159 header wait is it called header shown.
02:01:18.960 Okay, here I'll say uh you know hide
02:01:21.440 this say false. Okay. Now, as you can
02:01:24.960 tell, the content is out of the safe
02:01:27.760 area view. So, this is what we call the
02:01:30.080 safe area view. Anything within the, you
02:01:33.040 know, outside of the status bar, right?
02:01:35.520 So, here user cannot really see it
02:01:37.679 because it is behind the camera, it is,
02:01:39.920 you know, it is in the status bar. So,
02:01:42.239 to fix this, we we are going to create a
02:01:44.560 component. I'll go under the mobile just
02:01:47.280 shrink everything. Create the components
02:01:51.400 folder and I'll create a component
02:01:54.320 called save screen. Let's say JSX and
02:01:58.719 I'll get
02:02:00.520 RNF. Let's give elit spit space and get
02:02:04.080 started with it. So I'll just kill the
02:02:06.000 left hand side and let me just tell you
02:02:08.719 what we'll be doing. We will basically
02:02:10.719 take our entire application which is
02:02:12.719 this one and wrap it with the let's say
02:02:16.400 save
02:02:18.840 screen. So this is something we will
02:02:21.119 import. Let's save
02:02:24.599 it. Put this tag and then we will import
02:02:28.400 the save
02:02:32.520 screen. I know that this might look a
02:02:34.719 little bit weird but it'll make sense. I
02:02:36.639 promise just in a second. So we'll get
02:02:38.639 that under the components under the save
02:02:40.880 screen. Okay, let's save. Currently it
02:02:43.440 doesn't work but we're going to make
02:02:44.719 that work. So here basically we said
02:02:47.679 that everything in our app should be
02:02:50.480 under the save screen where we would
02:02:52.719 like to you know put the content within
02:02:55.360 the save area view. So here is what
02:02:57.840 we're going to be doing. We will take
02:02:59.599 the children which is our entire
02:03:02.080 application right the stack. So we'll
02:03:04.400 take the children and display
02:03:07.080 it. And then we'll add some styling.
02:03:10.560 I'll say style. Now we'll be using a
02:03:13.440 custom package or I should say just an
02:03:16.719 external package that has already been
02:03:18.960 installed when we create the expo
02:03:21.360 application. So you can double check
02:03:23.119 that under the package JSON. And the
02:03:25.840 package name is this one react native
02:03:29.199 save area context. So from here we'll
02:03:32.000 get a hook say insets and use save area
02:03:37.800 insets. Now you'll see the output here.
02:03:40.480 I'll say just give some padding from the
02:03:42.960 top. Let's say petting top. It'll be
02:03:45.440 inserts top. And let's give the flex to
02:03:49.199 be one. And then I'll say background
02:03:52.440 color could be from the colors.
02:03:57.199 Let's say it's going to be coming from
02:03:59.800 this constant that we have. I don't know
02:04:02.239 why we cannot see it. Let's try to
02:04:04.400 import it manually. I'll say
02:04:07.320 import the
02:04:09.320 colors
02:04:10.430 [Music]
02:04:12.679 from constants and colors
02:04:16.840 file. Okay. So why this does not
02:04:23.890 [Music]
02:04:25.000 work? Okay. So, I think my VS code is
02:04:27.599 kind of buggy. Let me fix
02:04:30.280 that. So, under the
02:04:32.840 mobile constants. Okay. Really, really
02:04:36.080 weird. But let's try to save it and give
02:04:39.520 it a go. I'll say colors do use the
02:04:42.199 background. Okay, let's save. Now, as
02:04:44.880 you can tell, the content is within the
02:04:47.520 save area view. If we didn't have this,
02:04:50.000 let me delete this petting top. Now, it
02:04:52.719 is outside of it. So this will by
02:04:54.800 default make sure that your content is
02:04:57.679 within the safe area view right which is
02:05:00.880 this container right. So it is right
02:05:03.520 here. So I hope that makes sense. This
02:05:05.360 is a component that I almost always use
02:05:08.159 in my react native applications uh to
02:05:10.880 get rid of this kind of effect right. I
02:05:13.840 don't really want my content to be
02:05:15.560 invisible. So this is a component that I
02:05:18.480 previously used as well in my previous
02:05:21.119 React Native tutorial. Now, this is kind
02:05:23.760 of not kind of, but literally annoying.
02:05:26.719 Okay, so I just paused the video and
02:05:28.320 take a look at it. I think it's because
02:05:30.320 we already have the colors coming from
02:05:32.639 the app example and we don't really need
02:05:35.119 this folder. We can delete it. That was
02:05:37.360 the previous the boiler plate
02:05:40.159 application from Expo. So, we could
02:05:42.320 literally delete that now probably and
02:05:45.520 hopefully it should work out. Okay, so
02:05:48.239 you can just delete that and bring this
02:05:49.920 back. Now, we don't really have that
02:05:51.360 there. You can delete the text. Here we
02:05:54.320 go. Okay. So, that's going to be it for
02:05:56.239 this section. Just keep this component
02:05:58.080 in mind. You can even put it in your
02:06:00.080 notes because probably in your next
02:06:02.560 applications, you would like to use
02:06:04.719 something like this, right? And we have
02:06:06.719 another option. You can put the petting
02:06:09.360 bottom as well. If your content is
02:06:12.239 overlapping with the you know with the
02:06:14.719 at the very bottom I don't know how to
02:06:16.639 call this but you can just say petting
02:06:20.599 bottom is going to be inserts bottom as
02:06:24.159 well and I think we have left and right
02:06:27.239 two okay so here I'll just have the top
02:06:30.480 only and hopefully I'll see you in the
02:06:32.960 next section so this is where we left
02:06:35.520 now let's try to set up the
02:06:36.960 authentication using clerk so you can
02:06:39.440 find the link in the description. I'll
02:06:41.280 go ahead and visit my
02:06:42.920 dashboard. Okay. So, if you go right
02:06:45.719 here, click to the dashboard and then
02:06:48.400 you should be able to see your
02:06:49.840 application. Just select that. This is
02:06:52.000 the one that we have created. I'll
02:06:53.920 select expo and we have already got the
02:06:57.040 public key. First, let's import the
02:07:00.079 package. I'll copy that. Open up my
02:07:02.880 terminal and just make sure that you are
02:07:05.040 under the mobile. So kill this paste
02:07:07.760 this in and at the same time you can set
02:07:10.800 up your env file. So I'll say env I
02:07:14.960 think they also call it as local. Let's
02:07:17.280 see. Not this is just not really that
02:07:20.079 important but like I'll just put it as
02:07:23.360 so that we have the exact same thing as
02:07:25.400 documentation. And just make sure to put
02:07:27.679 this file under the get ignore so that
02:07:30.239 you don't really push it to GitHub. Um
02:07:33.360 let's see. Just scroll to the very
02:07:35.480 bottom just put
02:07:37.719 env so that it is also
02:07:40.840 ignored. Okay. So I'll copy it and paste
02:07:44.719 this in. I think we can delete it from
02:07:46.639 the env file under the back end. We
02:07:50.000 don't really need it here on this file.
02:07:52.960 Okay. Now that we got the package, we
02:07:55.440 can start the app with MPX
02:07:58.840 expo. Let's say reload.
02:08:02.800 kill this
02:08:03.880 file and let's move on with the steps.
02:08:07.599 Okay, so they say update the layout, the
02:08:10.239 root layout, right? So I will get
02:08:13.719 this
02:08:15.320 and update that
02:08:17.800 file. So under the root layout we use
02:08:20.480 the stack instead this time we will put
02:08:23.440 the slot component which is like the
02:08:25.760 outlet if you have used it in react
02:08:28.400 right we have
02:08:29.880 outlet. So in react router DOM or react
02:08:32.960 router we had this component which
02:08:35.520 basically says put whatever page user in
02:08:38.480 right. So we'll get the slot from expo
02:08:41.159 router and then let's get the clerk
02:08:44.000 provider from this
02:08:48.679 import. And then I think we forgot to
02:08:52.159 like I accidentally delete the save
02:08:54.239 screen. Let me put that because we still
02:08:56.880 want to have our page to be under the
02:08:59.760 save area view. Okay. So that's it for
02:09:03.360 this step. Now we'll get this
02:09:06.920 package. So basically I am at the moment
02:09:09.679 doing everything the documentation
02:09:13.560 says import the expo secure store and
02:09:17.199 rerun the app. We can update the token
02:09:20.639 cache. So these are some configurations
02:09:23.199 that we are adding that clerk needs
02:09:25.440 behind the scenes to add a really robust
02:09:29.960 authentication. I'll get this import as
02:09:32.320 well. Paste this in. And I think we
02:09:35.360 should be good to go. Now we need to set
02:09:37.199 up our files. So here we will create a
02:09:40.800 group route or route group. Under the
02:09:43.679 app folder I will create this folder
02:09:46.400 with the brackets. So we'll create this
02:09:49.119 oath. Right? I will call this as oath
02:09:51.760 and we can put our authentication
02:09:53.679 screens within this file within this
02:09:56.320 folder. So here I'll have
02:10:00.040 sign-in.jsx and then I'll do the same
02:10:02.079 thing for sign
02:10:04.440 up and then we will create a layout
02:10:08.840 file
02:10:10.920 layout.jsx. So you might be asking can
02:10:13.199 we create more than one layout? Yes
02:10:15.360 absolutely. This is the root layout and
02:10:17.760 then this is the oath layout and you can
02:10:20.000 create more and more for every single
02:10:22.880 route that you have or every single
02:10:25.040 group right and then now let's copy this
02:10:28.000 for the layout this is what they say in
02:10:30.079 the documentation so under here I'll
02:10:32.880 paste this in basically this will check
02:10:35.040 if user is signed in or not if they are
02:10:37.760 signed in it will take them to the
02:10:39.360 homepage but else we will show them the
02:10:42.480 you know signin page or the signup page
02:10:45.360 okay So let's save and then the other
02:10:48.000 step is to set up the signup file as
02:10:50.800 well as the sign in. Let's put them one
02:10:53.679 by one. I'll basically copy and paste
02:10:56.159 and we will update these
02:10:59.960 files. Let's do the same thing for the
02:11:02.719 sign
02:11:03.880 in. Okay. So this is what I have. I'll
02:11:06.320 just paste this in. And then they have a
02:11:09.360 sign out button. Let's copy it.
02:11:12.880 create that under the
02:11:22.199 components. So we'll see everything just
02:11:24.560 in a second. For now, follow along with
02:11:26.880 me. And then finally, they have the
02:11:29.040 homepage, which is the page if user is
02:11:32.000 signed in or not. Right? It'll like if
02:11:34.480 they are signed in, they will see a
02:11:36.719 hello text with the user email. I'll
02:11:40.560 copy it. Now instead of calling it as
02:11:42.639 home I will say
02:11:44.760 root. So under the mobile under the app
02:11:48.000 I'll say create this root route and then
02:11:51.920 I'll put the so I will put the index.jsx
02:11:55.760 file which is my homepage. So we can
02:11:58.079 delete this one now that was just for
02:12:00.239 testing purposes. Let's put
02:12:03.480 this let's say get the sign out button.
02:12:07.280 So here we have an error because our
02:12:09.679 components are not under the app folder.
02:12:12.000 We can delete that. Now it should be
02:12:14.239 working out. And then I'll create
02:12:16.159 another file called underscore
02:12:19.880 layout.jsx. So here we'll put something
02:12:22.320 else that is going to check if user is
02:12:24.639 signed in or not. So let me just pretty
02:12:26.880 quickly provide this. I'll just paste
02:12:29.040 this in. Let me walk you through it. So
02:12:30.880 I just paste this in. Let me walk you
02:12:32.880 through it pretty quickly. This is just
02:12:34.560 a layout file where we check if user is
02:12:37.679 signed in or not. If they are not signed
02:12:39.760 in, we will take them to the sign-in
02:12:41.520 page, but else we'll show them the
02:12:43.599 homepage, right? Or whatever page they
02:12:45.920 are in. So, let's save and take a look
02:12:48.000 at the output. Hopefully, it'll work as
02:12:50.599 expected. Um, I'll reload my page. Well,
02:12:54.239 first let's delete the uh the
02:12:56.599 about.jsx and reload it
02:12:59.320 now. So, we are not authenticated.
02:13:02.239 That's why we are in the sign-in page.
02:13:04.480 So let's say sign
02:13:06.119 in. So here like there is no styles at
02:13:10.000 all but we have a text input. Let me put
02:13:12.960 my name or my
02:13:15.000 email. So I think like this is email and
02:13:18.239 this is password. I know that it's not
02:13:20.239 really visible but this is just for
02:13:22.639 testing purposes that clerk gives you.
02:13:25.119 We will change it
02:13:27.079 completely. So here we are in the signin
02:13:29.760 page. Let's go into the sign up. If you
02:13:31.760 click to it now, we are in the sign up
02:13:34.760 page. So let's take a look at the UI. We
02:13:38.719 have a text input. This is for the
02:13:41.159 verification. And then this is for the
02:13:43.280 sign up. We have a text input where we
02:13:46.159 can put the email and then the password.
02:13:48.639 And then we can submit that on press.
02:13:51.280 It'll call this
02:13:54.199 function. We're just going to call the
02:13:57.360 create method with the sign up and sign
02:13:59.920 up is coming from clerk, right? And then
02:14:03.040 we say prepare email address
02:14:05.079 verification and strategy is to send an
02:14:08.239 email code, a six-digit verification
02:14:10.719 code. And then this is going to update
02:14:13.599 the state so that we can see the
02:14:15.360 verification UI. So let's pretty quickly
02:14:17.679 go over it. I'll put the email that I
02:14:20.639 have for testing purposes. Let's get
02:14:23.360 this add
02:14:25.400 symbol. Paste this in. And I'll say
02:14:29.159 gmail.com. Now for the password, I'll
02:14:31.360 put something like 1 2 3 4 5 6. It
02:14:35.119 should fail because this is a really
02:14:36.800 weak password. If you open up the
02:14:39.360 terminal, it says it should be at least
02:14:41.760 six characters. Now, let me put an
02:14:44.719 actual secure
02:14:49.159 password. Okay. So, I'll just say
02:14:51.199 continue.
02:14:52.719 Now we got the verification code. Let's
02:14:55.360 take a look at it from my inbox. So this
02:14:57.840 is what we just got 0 minutes ago. And
02:15:00.079 this is the verification code. Let me
02:15:02.000 copy that and paste this
02:15:04.920 in. And then I'll say
02:15:07.719 verify. Okay, now we are logged in. We
02:15:10.400 can see the homepage, right? And if you
02:15:13.040 take a look at the dashboard, if you
02:15:15.040 just refresh that, you should be able to
02:15:17.520 see that this user just signed up. So
02:15:20.159 that means our authentication our
02:15:22.639 authentication system works
02:15:25.159 correctly. And by the way when we like
02:15:29.360 when we had the verification page this
02:15:31.760 is what we have seen. It says just put
02:15:34.480 your input which is coming from the
02:15:36.960 code. This is the state. Now this is
02:15:38.880 super basic react code. I don't really
02:15:41.119 know if you if you get confused but
02:15:43.679 basically we have some states. It is use
02:15:46.719 state. We have you know user router just
02:15:50.320 like in Nex.js or react router DOM you
02:15:53.280 navigate the user depending on the
02:15:55.119 actions and then we got some values and
02:15:58.239 functions from
02:16:00.520 clerk. So for the verification process
02:16:04.079 here it says just attempt email address
02:16:06.679 verification by passing the code. So if
02:16:09.440 you put the wrong code it is going to
02:16:12.159 fail right and we will even check for
02:16:14.480 that.
02:16:16.079 Okay, so here it says if it is complete
02:16:18.800 just activate the account and take user
02:16:21.040 to the homepage. This is exactly what
02:16:23.360 happened. But in the else case you can
02:16:25.280 handle this. They just put a console
02:16:27.880 log. Okay. So I hope all that makes
02:16:30.239 sense. Now we will go ahead and actually
02:16:32.558 completely change the UI so that we
02:16:35.040 could have this beautiful UI for these
02:16:37.280 pages. So this is the sign up, the
02:16:39.760 create account page, the sign in and
02:16:42.240 then the verification page.
02:16:45.439 Okay, so this is what we'll be doing
02:16:47.040 next. And just before we get into the
02:16:49.120 next section, I think we forgot to save
02:16:51.040 this file. Let's save it and try to you
02:16:54.000 know log out which is coming from the
02:16:56.240 sign out button file here. Once you
02:16:59.840 click to this button, once you click to
02:17:01.760 this touchable opacity, it'll call this
02:17:04.160 function called handle sign out and it
02:17:07.200 basically calls the sign out coming from
02:17:09.599 clerk and then it'll just redirect you
02:17:11.840 to the redirect to your desired page.
02:17:14.478 This is not really important. It'll take
02:17:16.160 you to the signup page, right? So, let's
02:17:18.638 save and click to it. Now, we are in the
02:17:22.398 signin page. So, that means everything
02:17:24.959 works correctly. Now, I just logged in
02:17:27.120 once again. And even if you don't have
02:17:29.040 this line, it should still work. It
02:17:30.959 should still navigate you to the sign-in
02:17:33.040 page. So, I'll go ahead click to it.
02:17:35.599 Now, we are signed out. Immediately, we
02:17:37.519 are in the sign-in page. And how does
02:17:39.679 that work? Well, basically under the
02:17:42.000 homepage we have this layout, right? We
02:17:44.558 say if user is not signed in, just take
02:17:47.040 them to the sign-in page immediately.
02:17:49.280 Use the redirect component coming from
02:17:52.080 expo router. Okay, so this is something
02:17:54.959 that we should keep in mind and with
02:17:57.519 that in the next section we will improve
02:18:00.080 our pages. All right, so this is where
02:18:02.638 we left. In the previous section, we
02:18:04.558 implemented the authentication in the
02:18:06.638 most basic way. Now let's try to fix our
02:18:09.840 pages because currently they look really
02:18:12.080 really ugly. So first we'll get started
02:18:14.478 with the signup page. Here we'll keep
02:18:17.280 all these states and functions. But here
02:18:20.080 I'd like to add one more state for the
02:18:22.638 error. Right? I'll say error set error.
02:18:26.638 Initially it could be an empty string.
02:18:29.200 So I'll say use state import that. And
02:18:33.439 you know instead of react use state let
02:18:35.760 me delete every one of
02:18:37.879 them. I'll just import use state from
02:18:40.638 react.
02:18:45.120 Okay, now we'll be using this. But
02:18:47.439 first, let's shrink everything and say,
02:18:50.558 you know, update the pending
02:18:52.160 verification UI. So, if you say like
02:18:55.280 this is
02:18:56.359 true, let me refresh our
02:19:00.200 page. So, I think we should visit the
02:19:03.040 signup page because this is where it'll
02:19:05.359 happen. Okay, if this is true, this is
02:19:07.679 what you're going to see. Now, we'll fix
02:19:09.599 this. Normally you don't really want to
02:19:11.359 put true but for now just to see the
02:19:13.519 output just to see the UI this is what
02:19:16.080 we're going to have. So we will return a
02:19:18.398 div which is a view component and then
02:19:21.359 we'll say style is going to be equal to
02:19:24.920 styles. Now this styles will be coming
02:19:27.599 from the oath styles file.
02:19:32.879 So let's say import the styles
02:19:36.840 from. So why my VS code doesn't really
02:19:39.679 work for the suggestions I don't really
02:19:42.000 know. So from the mobile folder we'll go
02:19:45.840 under the
02:19:48.359 assets. From here we'll go under the
02:19:50.720 styles and then we will get this folder
02:19:53.840 or the file which is oath.styles.js
02:20:00.040 JS where we have the styles import
02:20:04.200 right okay let's
02:20:06.439 save and shrink the left hand side now
02:20:09.359 here I'll say styles
02:20:12.120 doverification
02:20:19.160 container okay once you save it'll be
02:20:21.680 updated and then for the text I'll put
02:20:24.160 the verification title class let's save
02:20:27.280 UI is just getting better, right? And
02:20:29.840 then now we'll just check if we have an
02:20:32.080 error or not. What I'd like to do just
02:20:34.399 copy and paste and walk you through it.
02:20:36.560 Super simple. Five lines of code. So we
02:20:39.280 say if there is an error, display this
02:20:41.600 UI, but else don't show anything, right?
02:20:44.640 Let's import the colors. So this is
02:20:46.960 absolutely annoying. Let me just say
02:20:49.040 reload the
02:20:50.439 window so that hopefully it
02:20:53.319 works. Okay, it doesn't now. That's
02:20:56.080 fine. we'll import it manually but here
02:20:58.560 we are using an icon right so this is
02:21:01.120 coming from expo icons let's scroll to
02:21:03.920 the top so here I'll bring the import it
02:21:08.240 is coming from vector icons from expo so
02:21:11.760 we have bunch of different options so
02:21:13.840 like we are using ion icons but we have
02:21:16.399 like ant design let's see do we have any
02:21:20.240 other icons so we have evil icons
02:21:23.840 material icons bunch of different
02:21:25.760 options
02:21:26.560 This is the one that we'll be using in
02:21:28.240 this file. And let's import the colors
02:21:30.880 as well from the
02:21:34.120 constants. Okay, let's try to save. And
02:21:36.800 I'll just say let's have an
02:21:38.760 error. This is the container that you
02:21:41.200 would have for the error. Let's say, you
02:21:44.240 know, something went
02:21:47.080 wrong. This is how it would look like.
02:21:50.160 And you can close that. Obviously, for
02:21:52.000 now, it doesn't really work, but we'll
02:21:54.240 make that work because this is currently
02:21:57.640 hardcoded. So, basically, when you click
02:22:00.160 to this close icon, it will set the
02:22:02.720 state to be null so that this container
02:22:05.680 is just disappears, right? Okay. I hope
02:22:09.120 that makes sense. So, that was for the
02:22:11.439 error UI. Now, let's move on here. For
02:22:13.920 the text input, we would like to update
02:22:16.000 it. So, we'll keep the value, the
02:22:17.840 placeholder, the own change. But for the
02:22:21.760 you know for the styles we can add some
02:22:23.520 classes here. I'll do something else
02:22:25.840 that you have never seen before. I'll
02:22:28.000 say style. Now instead of an object this
02:22:30.880 will be an array. Now why this is the
02:22:33.040 case? Let's see. I'll say styles
02:22:36.120 doverification input. So let me pretty
02:22:39.120 quickly copy and paste. So this will
02:22:41.600 always be applied right. But we will say
02:22:44.640 if we have an error actually this should
02:22:48.080 be a comma. I'll say if we have an error
02:22:51.280 only then apply this which is the styles
02:22:54.399 do error
02:22:57.080 input. So you would use this array
02:22:59.520 syntax whenever you have something like
02:23:02.200 dynamic. So if we don't have an error we
02:23:04.880 will not get this class. Since this is
02:23:07.040 false we don't really get anything. But
02:23:08.960 if it was true the UI would be
02:23:13.080 updated. Okay. So in this case we're
02:23:15.600 going to put the error as the state. So
02:23:17.760 let's save the UI will be updated. Now
02:23:20.240 I'd like to change the placeholder text.
02:23:22.880 It is not really visible. So let me put
02:23:25.840 this value. Now it looks pretty cool.
02:23:28.319 And finally we would like to update the
02:23:30.240 button, right? The touchable opacity
02:23:32.640 here. I'll just say this style will be
02:23:34.800 the button that we have under the styles
02:23:37.600 so that we can get this output. And then
02:23:40.080 for the button text, I'll say style is
02:23:43.680 going to be styles dot button
02:23:48.680 text. Okay. So notice how if I visit the
02:23:52.479 colors file and if I wanted to use the
02:23:55.120 forest, everything is going to update
02:23:57.600 easily, right? I can change to be
02:24:00.920 ocean and purple.
02:24:03.920 Okay, so this is how easy it is to
02:24:05.760 update our theme thanks to this like
02:24:08.800 thanks to these files, right? As well as
02:24:11.600 the styles. Let's go into the old
02:24:15.000 styles.js. We are just using the colors,
02:24:18.240 right? That could be background, that
02:24:20.560 could be the white color, the border
02:24:22.479 color, text color. Everything is coming
02:24:24.800 from these objects. So I hope that makes
02:24:27.840 sense. I'll be using the copy by
02:24:29.760 default. And now I also want to get rid
02:24:32.800 of this header under the oath
02:24:37.319 file. Um here I'll just say screen
02:24:40.920 options header shown to be false.
02:24:44.560 Hopefully we'll get rid of that. Here we
02:24:47.880 go. So that was the verification UI. But
02:24:51.439 of course this is not going to be true.
02:24:53.200 It is going to be pending verification
02:24:56.160 only. In this case you are going to see
02:24:57.920 that UI by default. we would see the
02:25:00.640 signup page, the signup screen. And now
02:25:03.120 let's try to fix it. First, we can get
02:25:05.840 rid of this fragment that we don't
02:25:07.680 really need. And in this view, we'll
02:25:10.319 have some
02:25:11.479 classes. I think for now, we can just
02:25:13.840 say style is going to be flex of one so
02:25:17.520 that it is taking the entire screen. And
02:25:19.920 then maybe we can center that. I'll
02:25:23.640 say like
02:25:25.880 align content center. It should be
02:25:30.479 Maybe just apply content as
02:25:32.760 well.
02:25:34.280 Okay, maybe this should be align items.
02:25:37.439 Okay, here we go. Everything is being
02:25:39.040 centered. We are going to change this a
02:25:41.120 bit for now. Let's move on here. I'll
02:25:43.920 have another view that is going to wrap
02:25:46.399 everything. So, I'll cut that. Put it
02:25:49.280 right here. And then for the
02:25:52.359 styles we'll use the
02:25:55.960 styles dot let's say
02:25:59.560 container. After this one we are going
02:26:01.920 to get the image and in this case I'll
02:26:04.479 be using the second illustration that we
02:26:07.280 have. So I'm just importing it from the
02:26:09.280 assets. Let's import the expo
02:26:12.680 image here. I'll just scroll to the top.
02:26:15.200 I'll say import image from expo
02:26:23.800 image. Okay, so we have the image. For
02:26:26.399 some reason, it does not work. So I just
02:26:29.040 paused the video and try to understand
02:26:31.120 why that was the case. It's because
02:26:33.439 under the illustration class, we don't
02:26:36.000 really have the width to be a fixed
02:26:38.080 value. Previously, it was 100%. So I
02:26:41.520 just had to delete that and bring a
02:26:44.399 value like 300. Once you have done the
02:26:46.880 same thing, it should work out
02:26:48.720 correctly. So we got the image that
02:26:50.960 means we can move on with the text here.
02:26:54.240 Instead of sign up, I'll just say create
02:26:56.880 the account with this class called
02:26:59.520 title. And then within this uh right
02:27:03.280 after this one, we will put the exact
02:27:05.280 same thing that we had above. So it'll
02:27:08.800 be the error container. I'll copy
02:27:13.399 it and just paste this in. Okay. So if
02:27:17.120 we have an error, we'll just see it
02:27:19.280 right
02:27:20.760 here. And then we have the text input
02:27:23.760 for the email. So here it says do not
02:27:26.560 capitalize by default. So here we just
02:27:29.040 had none. The value is the email
02:27:31.200 address, the placeholder as well as the
02:27:33.439 onchange text. it'll basically update
02:27:36.000 the state with whatever user passes.
02:27:38.479 Right? So I will delete this and paste
02:27:41.040 my version. It's the exact same thing. I
02:27:43.680 just added the placeholder text as well
02:27:45.840 as this style. Let's save. Now this is
02:27:48.800 how that look. Let's do the same thing
02:27:50.960 for the password. I'll copy it and paste
02:27:54.720 this
02:27:56.120 in. Okay. So here we have let me save.
02:28:00.560 This is the output that we have. Now you
02:28:02.560 might be asking how does that work that
02:28:04.800 we don't see the characters. It's
02:28:07.359 because we have the secure text entry to
02:28:10.319 be equal to true. If it was false you
02:28:13.200 would see the
02:28:14.520 password. Okay. So let's bring this back
02:28:16.880 and it should be true. Whenever you
02:28:19.040 change the value it'll update the state
02:28:21.760 for the password. And then for the
02:28:24.479 continue text, I think we can delete
02:28:26.880 that and just put something like sign up
02:28:30.479 with the with the button class as well
02:28:32.800 as the button text so that we can get
02:28:35.439 this output. And then finally, we'll put
02:28:37.840 a beautiful UI. So at the moment, I'm
02:28:40.479 just copying and pasting. I can feel
02:28:42.640 like it is a little bit annoying, but
02:28:44.800 there is nothing related to React
02:28:47.040 Native. These are just some, you know,
02:28:49.520 views, texts, and some classes. So
02:28:52.720 that's why I'll just go ahead copy and
02:28:55.439 paste and walk you through it. So we got
02:28:57.920 a view with this class and then the
02:29:00.160 footer text that says already have an
02:29:02.479 account. If so, you have this link or
02:29:05.520 the button that will take you back. So
02:29:08.720 if you clicked it, you'll go back to the
02:29:10.640 signin page with the router.back method.
02:29:14.399 And the router is coming from Expo from
02:29:18.000 Expo router. So I'll click to it. We are
02:29:21.040 in the signup page and we can click to
02:29:23.040 this one. We can go back now. Everything
02:29:25.280 looks fine but we actually have a
02:29:27.680 problem. I don't know if you have
02:29:29.280 realized it but just press command shift
02:29:32.080 K bring the uh bring the keyboard. So
02:29:35.439 whenever you click to the let me refresh
02:29:38.640 the page. Sorry just refresh the
02:29:40.960 application. So whenever you click to
02:29:42.960 the input it is not really visible right
02:29:45.680 keyboard overlaps that. So to fix this
02:29:49.280 we have a couple of different options.
02:29:51.040 There is a component coming from React
02:29:53.120 Native called keyboard avoiding view.
02:29:56.160 Now you can use this instead of the
02:29:58.319 basic view that we have. So I'll say
02:30:00.800 keyboard avoiding
02:30:02.840 view. So by default it is not going to
02:30:05.439 fix it. You had to add some options. So
02:30:08.399 instead of doing that I'll be using a
02:30:10.439 package which is this one. Let me pretty
02:30:13.640 quickly show you this. So, React Native
02:30:16.640 keyboard keyboard aware scroll view. So,
02:30:19.600 it's really popular and this is the
02:30:22.080 output that you would have whenever you
02:30:24.399 click to an input. It'll just scroll
02:30:27.160 automatically because it is aware of the
02:30:30.080 situation. So, let's try to copy it
02:30:33.960 and you know run this from our
02:30:38.439 terminal. So, it has just been
02:30:40.399 installed. Let's run the application and
02:30:43.120 we are going to set this up. So instead
02:30:45.439 of this we'll say keyboard aware scroll
02:30:50.920 view which is going to be coming from
02:30:53.359 that package. Let me get the
02:30:56.280 import and we can delete the link as
02:30:59.200 well as this one that we are not using.
02:31:01.600 So we're going to be using this from
02:31:03.120 that
02:31:04.439 package here. Uh let's delete the
02:31:08.120 styles. And for the style, we'll only
02:31:10.640 have the flex of one. And then we'll say
02:31:13.680 content container style will be
02:31:16.319 incremented like flex grow of one. And
02:31:19.200 then we'll say enable it on the Android
02:31:21.520 as well as well as enable the automatic
02:31:24.319 scroll. And then now we can save and
02:31:26.880 give it a go here. I'll refresh my
02:31:31.160 application. Okay, looks like it
02:31:33.200 crashed. Let's say press
02:31:37.399 I so it can run
02:31:43.720 this and I'll clicked it. Now here we
02:31:47.200 can see it just scrolls automatically
02:31:49.439 and if you click outside it's going to
02:31:51.439 close that. Same for this one. Pretty
02:31:54.240 cool. You can add even more things which
02:31:57.040 are coming from the documentation. So
02:31:59.120 I'll put something like extra scroll
02:32:01.520 height. Let's say it'll be 100. So if
02:32:04.560 you click to this one, it'll scroll even
02:32:06.960 more, right? So we have 100 space, extra
02:32:11.120 space. If you delete that, notice how
02:32:14.160 it'll only scroll as much as needed,
02:32:17.280 which is something that I'll
02:32:19.640 leave. And I just opened the application
02:32:22.399 in the Android as well as the iOS
02:32:24.880 physical devices. So let's double check
02:32:27.200 if it is working correctly. I'll click
02:32:29.280 to this. it scrolls automatically,
02:32:31.600 right? And for the password, you know,
02:32:34.560 keyboard scrolls and UI updates uh
02:32:37.720 automatically. Same for the iOS, I mean
02:32:40.960 Android. Here you can see the keyboard
02:32:43.920 doesn't really overlap with the input.
02:32:48.200 Okay. Now, we can
02:32:51.240 actually visit the sign-in page and get
02:32:54.080 started with it. Currently, it looks
02:32:56.240 really, really ugly. So I'll visit the
02:32:58.640 sign-in page and all we have to do just
02:33:01.520 repeat ourselves because the
02:33:03.280 functionality is already working. We'll
02:33:05.439 just update the UI. Right. So we
02:33:07.920 previously checked that we can sign up
02:33:09.920 correctly successfully and we can sign
02:33:12.920 in. Okay, just to speed up the process,
02:33:15.760 I'll go ahead and do some copy pasting,
02:33:18.000 but I'll walk you through it 100%. So
02:33:20.800 we'll get our import at the very top and
02:33:23.600 let's actually get the image as well
02:33:25.840 from React Native. We'll be using that.
02:33:29.200 So let's scroll to the bottom where we
02:33:31.359 have this view. We are going to update
02:33:33.680 it with the keyboard aware scroll view
02:33:37.520 so that we have this beautiful scroll
02:33:40.640 animation. Right? The keyboard doesn't
02:33:42.720 really overlap with the text
02:33:45.479 input. Okay. So the other thing we'll
02:33:48.240 have is the container view. Let me put
02:33:51.040 that and wrap the entire application
02:33:53.359 with
02:33:55.479 it and just make sure that this is
02:33:58.080 called keyboard aware scroll
02:34:01.720 view. Okay. So I'll get the container
02:34:04.960 class on this view. The styles should be
02:34:08.080 imported
02:34:09.240 from from the oath
02:34:13.640 styles. And then for the text we will
02:34:16.160 have something like welcome back. And
02:34:18.399 just above that we will have the image.
02:34:20.720 So let's paste this in. This is what we
02:34:22.640 have. If you wanted to you can update
02:34:24.800 the image but this is what I'll have in
02:34:27.840 the signin page. And then let's put the
02:34:30.720 error container just like previously
02:34:33.280 right after the welcome back text. I'll
02:34:36.479 paste this in. Let's import the ion
02:34:39.800 icons. get the colors and let's create
02:34:43.600 this error
02:34:49.560 state. Let's say use state of null. But
02:34:53.040 first, let's delete those and say this
02:34:56.479 is going to be use
02:34:59.479 state. I'm too lazy to type this out.
02:35:02.080 I'll just paste
02:35:03.319 in. Okay, this is what we have. If we
02:35:05.920 had an error, this would be the output.
02:35:10.240 Okay. And then we'll update the text
02:35:12.080 input which is going to be for the email
02:35:15.280 here. I'll go ahead delete this one.
02:35:17.200 Paste this in. We have the placeholder
02:35:20.240 uh I mean the placeholder and then the
02:35:22.560 text color and then some styles. This is
02:35:25.520 what we have. And then let's get the
02:35:27.399 password. So this is exact same thing
02:35:29.680 that we have done in the signup page. I
02:35:32.000 hope you are not really bored just
02:35:34.319 because we copy and paste. And I really
02:35:36.560 really hope that you are not angry
02:35:38.319 because you don't really learn anything
02:35:39.920 at this point. These are the things that
02:35:41.920 you have learned a couple of minutes ago
02:35:44.160 right here.
02:35:45.479 Right. Okay. So I'll just paste this in.
02:35:48.479 And then I think we need to put the sign
02:35:52.560 in button which is going to be a
02:35:54.479 touchable opacity. So I will just update
02:35:57.359 that. This is what we have. on press we
02:35:59.840 are going to call the function that will
02:36:01.840 log us in and then at the very bottom we
02:36:04.640 will handle the
02:36:07.800 navigation so I'll delete this view
02:36:10.319 paste this in now here if you put a
02:36:12.960 single code I think eslint is going to
02:36:15.520 give you a warning so it says use one of
02:36:18.399 these options to escape the single code
02:36:22.080 and here we are using add
02:36:24.760 apos and then semicolon so that we don't
02:36:27.920 really get any warnings. Really
02:36:30.000 annoying, really used to a bit, but this
02:36:31.840 is what ESLint wants you to have. So, we
02:36:34.640 have to listen to it. And then we have
02:36:37.359 the link and then we have the touchable
02:36:39.359 opacity within that. That is going to
02:36:41.520 take us to the signup
02:36:44.680 page. Let's try to sign in with the
02:36:47.120 account that we have
02:36:49.560 created. So, I'll just kill the keyboard
02:36:52.000 so that I can type this out pretty
02:36:53.840 quickly. Now for some reason I cannot
02:36:56.160 add the ads symbol. I'll just do it in
02:36:59.600 this way. Copy and
02:37:04.760 paste. Now let's put the wrong password
02:37:08.760 actually. So I'll put the wrong
02:37:11.720 one. Let's
02:37:14.120 see. Okay, it says password is
02:37:16.720 incorrect. But I think we cannot see it
02:37:19.920 because in the function we didn't really
02:37:21.920 handle that, right? So here if we have
02:37:24.800 an error we only console log it instead
02:37:27.120 of actually you know instead of instead
02:37:30.479 of actually properly handling that. So
02:37:33.359 for this I'll go under the catch instead
02:37:36.000 of just console logging it I will paste
02:37:38.319 this in. So what are we doing? We are
02:37:41.439 just going under the code right under
02:37:43.520 the errors under the code we say if the
02:37:46.399 password is incorrect. If this is the
02:37:48.800 case, just set the error to be this
02:37:51.680 value. But else just put something like
02:37:54.399 a general message. Let's say UI should
02:37:57.760 be
02:37:58.439 updated. Here we go. But if it is
02:38:01.680 correct, so I'll put the correct one. We
02:38:04.640 should be logged in
02:38:09.319 hopefully. So is it wrong again? Let me
02:38:12.399 double check. I'll put the correct one.
02:38:20.880 Okay, looks like it's correct. Now we
02:38:23.200 are logged in uh and navigated to the
02:38:26.399 homepage automatically. Now there is one
02:38:28.479 more thing that I'd like to optimize in
02:38:30.800 the signup page. So let's try to see
02:38:33.200 what I mean. If I try to sign up with
02:38:35.600 the exact same email. So I'll just put
02:38:37.760 this one. Let me get the add
02:38:44.040 symbol and I'll just put a password.
02:38:47.200 Let's say sign up. Now if you check the
02:38:49.840 terminal, it says this email address is
02:38:52.560 already taken. Please try another one.
02:38:55.439 So we can double check this code as
02:38:57.680 well. If this is the case, we can throw
02:39:00.319 an error like this one. So for this
02:39:03.520 we'll go under the on signup press and
02:39:07.280 under the catch we can handle that. So
02:39:10.240 I'll provide this to
02:39:12.840 you here. I'll paste this in. Let's try
02:39:15.840 to sign up. Okay, this is the case. So
02:39:18.960 we hit the hit the if check and update
02:39:21.760 the state so that UI can be updated. If
02:39:24.720 you click to this one, it'll just it'll
02:39:26.720 be gone. Now, just to double check
02:39:28.640 everything is working, I'll go delete
02:39:30.960 this user and sign up from
02:39:33.240 scratch so that we can see if the verify
02:39:36.160 page is still working correctly. Okay,
02:39:39.359 user has been deleted. We can go into
02:39:41.840 the signup page. Let me put a correct
02:39:45.160 password. So, if you put something like
02:39:47.520 1 2 3, you will get this error which you
02:39:50.960 can handle it. So all you have to do
02:39:53.439 just take a look at the
02:39:55.960 terminal. Okay, I think we are not
02:39:58.080 console logging it but let's let's do
02:40:00.479 it. Say console log the error itself.
02:40:04.080 Sign
02:40:05.399 up. Okay, you can basically take this
02:40:08.399 error and put it into the terminal or
02:40:10.720 into the UI. I'll skip that because I
02:40:13.200 already show you how you can handle the
02:40:15.880 errors. Let's try to actually put a
02:40:18.800 correct password.
02:40:21.680 or a password that is going to be
02:40:24.760 accepted. So, it'll take us to this
02:40:27.399 page. Let's get the verification
02:40:30.760 code. Okay. So, I just got that. Let me
02:40:33.760 copy and
02:40:36.280 paste. Let's say verify. We are in the
02:40:40.040 homepage. And from the dashboard, we
02:40:42.800 should be able to see that user that has
02:40:44.880 just logged in. Okay. So I think that's
02:40:47.600 going to for the entire authentication
02:40:50.600 flow. We already built it but we just
02:40:53.439 had to update the UI. I think the most
02:40:55.920 important thing that you should keep in
02:40:57.520 mind from this section is this component
02:41:00.479 because otherwise you would get the
02:41:02.960 strange behavior where the keyboard is
02:41:06.479 overlapping with the content right with
02:41:08.720 the text input. So this is definitely
02:41:11.200 something that you should keep in mind
02:41:12.880 for your next project. Okay. So I just
02:41:16.160 closed every single file that we had.
02:41:18.240 Normally I was going to end this section
02:41:20.399 right here but I just said let me take a
02:41:22.640 quick step back and try to explain
02:41:24.640 everything that we have done so far so
02:41:26.800 you don't really you don't really get
02:41:28.439 confused. So we just said that this app
02:41:30.960 folder is special for expo where we have
02:41:33.840 our navigation files and we have some
02:41:36.399 special files like underscore layout as
02:41:39.439 well as the index.jsx. Then we have some
02:41:42.240 routes. So everything starts from the
02:41:44.720 root layout where we have handled the
02:41:46.880 authentication thanks to clerk. Then we
02:41:49.520 have this safe screen trick which is a
02:41:52.240 component that we have created so that
02:41:54.560 our content is not overflowing with the
02:41:57.520 status bar. Right? We just added this
02:42:00.080 inserts top which is going to be
02:42:02.319 dynamic. Our content is always visible.
02:42:05.840 Okay. Then we put the slot component
02:42:08.399 which is going to render the currently
02:42:10.399 selected content.
02:42:13.120 And then we have the oath pages that has
02:42:16.080 a layout file which is going to check
02:42:18.319 for the authentication. So if you are
02:42:20.560 signed in and if you want to visit the
02:42:23.160 authentication authentication pages you
02:42:25.840 cannot see that right it says if you are
02:42:28.000 logged in you will be redirected to the
02:42:30.439 homepage and then we have the sign in
02:42:33.120 and sign up pages which are mostly
02:42:35.600 coming from clerk. So all we had to do
02:42:38.399 just update the UI right with this
02:42:41.040 component and some icons some error
02:42:44.000 containers and for the icons we are
02:42:46.399 using ion icons and here is how that
02:42:49.200 work. All you have to do just add a
02:42:51.359 name. So here we use the close icon but
02:42:54.240 you could use bunch of different
02:42:56.840 things. I mean like all of them are
02:42:59.359 coming from you know ion icons. So
02:43:02.880 literally thousands of different icons
02:43:05.520 and we'll be using bunch of different
02:43:07.760 icons. So this is the one called close
02:43:10.960 that would give you this output
02:43:14.479 uh sorry this one and then we have like
02:43:17.040 alert circle which is this
02:43:19.640 one. Okay then let's see what we have
02:43:23.000 done. We have used this component as I
02:43:25.680 said which is coming from this package.
02:43:28.080 Otherwise the keyboard is going to
02:43:30.000 overflow the inputs. Then we did the
02:43:32.960 similar thing in the signup page. So
02:43:35.439 there is no reason to explain this. Like
02:43:38.800 honestly it feels like an English
02:43:40.560 sentence. You can just read the
02:43:42.240 comments. Everything should be pretty
02:43:44.319 clear. We just handled the error cases
02:43:47.359 just to have a better
02:43:50.040 output. And then let's see under the
02:43:52.640 root we have a layout file as well. This
02:43:55.760 is going to handle the navigation. the
02:43:58.240 redirection if user is not authenticated
02:44:00.960 we will take them to the sign-in page
02:44:03.920 and then the homepage content currently
02:44:06.560 this doesn't really do anything in the
02:44:08.640 next section we are going to fetch data
02:44:11.040 so that we can have this kind of a
02:44:13.520 output right so this is the homepage
02:44:15.760 that we're going to build in the next
02:44:17.279 section I hope everything makes sense so
02:44:20.000 far like I can understand if it is your
02:44:23.200 very first time some some stuff could be
02:44:26.160 really annoying and confusing using, but
02:44:28.640 I would say it's going to get a lot
02:44:30.960 easier and a lot more it's going to make
02:44:33.279 a lot more sense as we go through the
02:44:35.439 tutorial. Okay, so I hope you enjoyed
02:44:37.760 it. I'll see you in the next section.
02:44:40.240 Now, it is time to get started with the
02:44:42.319 homepage. So, this is the end result
02:44:44.319 that we're going to have. Basically, we
02:44:46.240 need a query so that we can get the
02:44:48.720 balance. This is what we call the
02:44:50.479 summary. And then we have the
02:44:52.279 transactions. This is another get
02:44:54.319 request. And then we are going to need a
02:44:56.240 delete request so that we can delete the
02:44:58.880 transactions. Right? So to be able to
02:45:01.120 fetch those, we need to pass the user
02:45:03.120 ID. Let's take a look at it. Under the
02:45:05.880 server.js under under the routes, we say
02:45:09.040 that if we want to get the transactions
02:45:11.120 by user ID, we need to pass the user ID
02:45:13.840 into the URL. And same for the summary.
02:45:17.120 And if we want to delete one, we need to
02:45:19.200 pass the uh transaction ID that we would
02:45:22.080 like to delete. Right? Okay. So let's
02:45:24.399 keep this in mind and try to build those
02:45:27.000 functions. Now for this I will create a
02:45:29.760 hooks folder and we are going to create
02:45:32.160 a custom hook called use
02:45:36.200 transactions.js file. So this has
02:45:38.560 nothing to do with React Native. This is
02:45:40.720 going to be a super simple React custom
02:45:43.920 hook. Okay. So this is just a React
02:45:46.479 custom hook file. It has nothing to do
02:45:49.279 with React Native. your React knowledge
02:45:51.600 should be enough to build this entire
02:45:53.439 file. Okay, so let's go ahead and get
02:45:55.760 started with it. First, I'd like to
02:45:57.680 export this use transactions book. Let's
02:46:02.240 say this is going to
02:46:04.120 be an arrow function and we would like
02:46:07.200 to get the user ID as the argument and
02:46:10.000 then we are going to have couple of
02:46:11.439 different states. So, let me just
02:46:13.359 provide them to you. We will have the
02:46:15.439 transactions state which is going to be
02:46:17.680 an empty array. Once we fetch it, it'll
02:46:20.560 be an array of transactions like these
02:46:23.120 ones, right? And then we're going to
02:46:24.880 have a state to keep track of the
02:46:27.040 summary where we have the balance,
02:46:29.200 income, and expenses, which is going to
02:46:32.000 be an object. Let me provide that one as
02:46:34.600 well. So, we have the summary with
02:46:37.279 balance, income, and expenses. By
02:46:39.520 default, you can put anything. I'll just
02:46:41.359 go with zero. And we will update them.
02:46:43.840 And then for the loading state we will
02:46:46.000 have the true by default because we
02:46:48.160 would like to fetch it immediately once
02:46:50.319 we fetch that. This is going to be equal
02:46:52.080 to false. Now I would like to create a
02:46:55.240 variable here. I'll say con API URL so
02:47:00.240 that we don't really need to type this
02:47:01.840 out again and again. So we'll say
02:47:05.720 http localhost 501 /
02:47:10.359 ai which is our API URL right and then
02:47:13.760 we're going to have couple of different
02:47:15.200 functions. So first I'd like to say get
02:47:18.240 the transactions let's say fetch
02:47:21.080 transactions which is going to be an
02:47:23.200 async
02:47:25.080 function where we'll have a try and
02:47:27.520 catch block. Under the try, we can get
02:47:29.680 the response by sending a fetch request
02:47:33.200 to let's just put back. We'll say API
02:47:37.160 URL slash it is a
02:47:40.439 transactions and then slash whatever the
02:47:43.439 user ID is. Let's put the user ID and
02:47:46.960 then we'll get the
02:47:48.760 data say await
02:47:52.840 response.json. Once we got the data, we
02:47:55.439 can set our state with it. So I'll say
02:47:57.279 set transactions with this data and for
02:47:59.920 the catch case I'll just put a console
02:48:01.840 log to simply handle this. Now we'll be
02:48:04.960 calling this function under a use effect
02:48:07.439 and I'd like to optimize this function.
02:48:10.240 So for now I'll just cut that. Okay. So
02:48:12.399 cut it with me. We'll say wrap this with
02:48:15.040 a use call back function. Okay. So let's
02:48:17.680 say use callback which is coming from
02:48:19.680 react. Now we can pass the function and
02:48:22.800 then as the dependency array we will put
02:48:25.120 the user ID. So whenever the user ID
02:48:28.000 changes it's going to recreate this
02:48:30.399 function. So let me just put a comment.
02:48:32.960 Let's say use callback is used for
02:48:38.359 performance
02:48:39.960 reasons it will memorize the function.
02:48:44.560 So it'll basically cach that. So if you
02:48:47.439 hover over that you can read it. Um,
02:48:49.760 it's the exact same thing that I just
02:48:51.439 said. Now, in the same way, I would like
02:48:53.520 to create one more function that will
02:48:55.680 get the summary. Since it's the same
02:48:57.920 thing, I'll just paste this in super
02:49:00.080 basic JavaScript code, right? Super
02:49:02.399 basic react code where we wrap the
02:49:04.720 function with the use call back hook.
02:49:07.200 And then finally, we will have one more
02:49:09.760 function to be able to call both of them
02:49:12.800 at the same time. So, I'll just paste
02:49:14.720 this in. It is called as load data. So
02:49:18.160 this function is going to call the fetch
02:49:20.560 transactions as well as the fetch
02:49:22.319 summary at once. So here we just say
02:49:25.240 promise.all so that these functions can
02:49:28.200 be run in
02:49:31.319 parallel. Now what do I mean like maybe
02:49:34.160 as a beginner you would do this. You
02:49:36.240 would say instead of this entire thing
02:49:39.120 let me type this out. I'll say erate
02:49:41.439 fetch
02:49:43.000 transactions and then once this is done
02:49:45.600 just go ahead fetch the summary. So you
02:49:48.560 can do it in this way as well but there
02:49:50.560 is no reason like there is no reason to
02:49:53.760 do it in this way because here is how
02:49:55.920 that work. First you will run this.
02:49:58.080 Let's say it'll take 2 seconds. Until
02:50:00.560 this is done you cannot call that. Once
02:50:02.880 this is done then you can call this
02:50:05.040 right? But it doesn't have to be. we can
02:50:07.760 fetch this first or this one first right
02:50:11.359 we can just call them at the same time
02:50:13.520 whichever ends first we're going to get
02:50:16.120 that so instead of doing doing it in
02:50:19.200 this way I hope I have explained it
02:50:21.760 clearly but basically instead of doing
02:50:24.000 in this way you would like to call them
02:50:25.680 in parallel so that this doesn't have to
02:50:28.319 wait for this one or vice versa okay and
02:50:31.840 then we are updating the aloing state
02:50:33.920 finally we'll just say it's going to be
02:50:35.600 equal to false these These are the get
02:50:38.319 methods that we have. At the very end, I
02:50:40.800 will add the delete functionality. So
02:50:43.120 I'll say delete transaction. This is a
02:50:45.439 function that takes the transaction ID
02:50:48.080 where we sent a delete request to this
02:50:50.640 URL. And if it is done, we will load the
02:50:53.520 data again to refresh the UI. And now we
02:50:56.960 we are using the alert. Let's import it
02:50:59.359 from React Native. So here I'll just
02:51:01.680 scroll to the top. Let's say import the
02:51:04.760 alert from React
02:51:07.560 Native. Let's say alert. It should be
02:51:10.520 okay. Now depending on the success case
02:51:13.840 or error case will show an error or a
02:51:16.720 success message. So you're going to see
02:51:18.880 you're going to see this once we call
02:51:21.120 this function. Okay. Now this is the
02:51:23.600 entire hook. All we want to do just go
02:51:25.920 at the very bottom still within the
02:51:28.479 hook. Okay. Within the hook, we'll just
02:51:31.120 say return an object with all these
02:51:33.200 fields. So, we would like to return the
02:51:35.279 transactions. We would like to return
02:51:37.200 the summary, the is loading state, and
02:51:39.520 then our functions, which is the load
02:51:41.840 data as well as the delete
02:51:44.920 transaction. Okay, so these are the only
02:51:47.200 two functions that we will export. We
02:51:49.520 will return. Now, you might be asking
02:51:51.680 why don't we return this function as
02:51:54.160 well as this one? Because they are
02:51:56.319 called under the load data. Okay.
02:52:00.000 Now let's try to actually call this hook
02:52:02.319 under the homepage. Here I'll visit the
02:52:05.240 index.js file and let's try to you know
02:52:09.760 call that hook. I'll say use
02:52:12.359 transactions and here we would like to
02:52:14.560 pass the user ID right this hook wants
02:52:18.000 you to pass the user ID and we can get
02:52:20.319 that by doing user dot id which is
02:52:24.319 coming from clerk and then we'll just
02:52:26.560 say from this hook we are getting a
02:52:28.560 couple of different values such as the
02:52:30.920 transactions we are getting the summary
02:52:33.520 we are getting the loading state the
02:52:35.680 load data method as well as the delete
02:52:38.200 transaction method or the function
02:52:40.880 Now what I'd like to do just say under a
02:52:43.200 use
02:52:44.200 effect call the load
02:52:48.680 data and then we'll just say uh leave
02:52:51.760 this as empty but I think we are getting
02:52:53.760 a warning. So let's say just add the
02:52:56.160 load
02:52:57.319 data. Okay, I'd like to console log
02:53:00.000 this. Let's say console log data is
02:53:03.840 loaded and we can get the transactions
02:53:07.120 or actually let's say
02:53:12.120 transactions and then let's do the
02:53:14.240 summary as
02:53:18.760 well.
02:53:21.720 Okay. Now looks like we got an error. Uh
02:53:24.720 let's try to see why this is the case. I
02:53:27.359 think it's because I am not running the
02:53:29.200 back end here. Here I'll go ahead run
02:53:31.880 this. Let's say cd back end and say mpm
02:53:35.279 run a dev. Now if you are running the if
02:53:38.399 you're running the application from your
02:53:40.240 physical device you're going to get into
02:53:42.479 an error and I'll give you the solution
02:53:44.479 in a couple of minutes. But for now just
02:53:46.880 follow along with me. Go ahead run the
02:53:49.040 back end in the mobile. Now reload this
02:53:51.520 app by pressing R. And I am logged in.
02:53:54.880 As you can tell we got the balance,
02:53:57.279 expenses and income. So it is working
02:53:59.680 correctly. The only issue that we have
02:54:02.800 like let me let me display I'll say
02:54:06.080 console log user ID and let's say user
02:54:09.680 do ID which is coming from clerk. We
02:54:12.240 should be able to see it. Okay. So this
02:54:14.560 is the user ID but in our transactions
02:54:17.760 we put some test user ids. Let me
02:54:21.960 refresh. Okay. So let's try to actually
02:54:24.880 put the correct user ID. So, I'll paste
02:54:27.279 this in. Paste this in. Uh, let's say
02:54:30.319 paste this in as
02:54:32.760 well. Now, our balance should be
02:54:35.640 updated. I'll go under DBS code. Let's
02:54:39.520 reload our
02:54:42.359 app. Okay. So, as you can tell now, the
02:54:45.760 balance is actually coming from the API,
02:54:48.880 right? That means everything is working
02:54:50.720 correctly. Same for the transactions.
02:54:53.359 Now we have done this manually but this
02:54:56.080 is just for now. Later in the video once
02:54:58.640 we build the create page we don't really
02:55:00.880 need to do it manually. It'll happen
02:55:03.640 automatically. Okay. But now if you are
02:55:06.479 following along with your actual
02:55:08.240 physical device you are going to get
02:55:10.399 some errors. And let me actually open up
02:55:13.120 my camera as well as the as well as my
02:55:15.600 phone and take a look at the error
02:55:19.720 together. So I just scanned the QR code.
02:55:22.640 Let's see what is the
02:55:26.040 problem. Like I'll try to pretty quickly
02:55:28.720 log in. So I put the credentials. I'll
02:55:31.120 log
02:55:33.319 in. Okay. So at the very end it says
02:55:37.040 network request failed. I don't know if
02:55:39.840 you can read it but like why this is the
02:55:42.960 case. Now the problem here is that I am
02:55:46.160 trying to call the local host from my
02:55:48.640 actual device. Right here in our code,
02:55:51.920 let's take a look at it. Uh under the
02:55:55.200 use transactions which is our mobile
02:55:57.600 phone. Here we say call the local host.
02:56:00.880 Now when you call it from your physical
02:56:03.040 device that means like it understands
02:56:05.840 that your back end is running on your on
02:56:08.880 your phone which is not the case. Local
02:56:10.960 host is your laptop. So it cannot
02:56:13.840 connect to it. Let me actually visualize
02:56:16.399 this under an image. So when you are
02:56:18.880 running the simulator it works because
02:56:21.520 the local host in this case means your
02:56:24.479 laptop right it works correctly with
02:56:26.800 your simulator but if it is your
02:56:28.880 physical device local host means this
02:56:31.840 exact phone which is not the place that
02:56:35.439 our back end is running our back end is
02:56:37.760 in our laptop. So to be able to fix
02:56:40.479 this, we need to take our entire API and
02:56:44.479 deploy it like deploy it to the cloud.
02:56:47.920 And this is exactly what we're going to
02:56:49.680 be doing in the next section. All right.
02:56:52.240 So this is where we left. Now in this
02:56:54.000 section, we would like to deploy our
02:56:55.520 API. We have talked about why because if
02:56:58.399 you don't deploy it, you cannot really
02:57:00.560 use this application from your physical
02:57:02.640 device. You can use it from the
02:57:04.399 simulator but not on your physical
02:57:06.760 device because we are calling the local
02:57:09.279 host. So we'll just deploy this uh API
02:57:12.720 first. I would like to shrink everything
02:57:14.800 and actually kill everything that we
02:57:16.720 have. I'll open up a new terminal and I
02:57:20.080 would like to first uh push this code to
02:57:22.720 GitHub because we'll be using a platform
02:57:25.520 called render.com which has a free plan.
02:57:28.399 You don't need to pay anything. With
02:57:30.399 this we will deploy our API. To be able
02:57:32.720 to use this first we need to uh like
02:57:35.920 first we need to first we need to push
02:57:38.000 our code to GitHub. So here I'll create
02:57:40.640 a repository. Uh let's say the name
02:57:43.200 could be something like wallet API. I'll
02:57:45.760 make it private. If you wanted to you
02:57:47.680 can go with public. It's not really that
02:57:50.359 important. Okay. Now let's try to create
02:57:53.279 this as a git repo. I'll say cd into the
02:57:56.720 back
02:57:57.800 end and just say get in it. Now we don't
02:58:02.000 really want to push our credentials to
02:58:04.240 GitHub, right? So for this I'll say
02:58:06.560 create the MV file sorry get ignore file
02:58:10.880 get ignore and then we will say ignore
02:58:14.080 the MV file as well as as well as the
02:58:16.960 node
02:58:18.279 modules. Okay, let's save. Now they
02:58:20.640 should be ignored as we can tell. Now we
02:58:23.040 can basically take everything and push
02:58:24.880 it to GitHub. First just make sure you
02:58:27.760 have the actually the start command
02:58:30.399 right and then we can just say get add
02:58:34.520 everything get commit dash m which
02:58:38.560 stands for message let's say something
02:58:40.560 like initial
02:58:42.680 commit and
02:58:44.600 just you know commit that now I'll go
02:58:47.600 ahead and get this
02:58:49.800 script this command paste this in is
02:58:53.279 going to take the entire backend code
02:58:55.040 and push it to
02:58:57.319 GitHub. Okay, notice how we don't have
02:58:59.760 the
02:59:00.680 env modules, which is something that we
02:59:03.439 want, right? We don't want them to be
02:59:05.520 right here. Okay, so I'll go under the
02:59:08.560 dashboard. I already have an account. Go
02:59:11.200 ahead, create one and then just say
02:59:13.120 deploy a web service. We will select
02:59:16.160 this wallet
02:59:18.840 API. Let's grab our environment
02:59:21.359 variables. By the way, I'll copy
02:59:23.359 everything that we have
02:59:25.640 and we will paste this in under the
02:59:28.960 environment variables. Now, paste this
02:59:31.760 in. Don't change anything. Leave it as
02:59:33.760 it is. Scroll to the top. Select the
02:59:36.160 free plan. And then notice how it says
02:59:39.439 the build command is npm install, which
02:59:42.080 is correct because if you think about
02:59:44.000 it, when render takes your code, it
02:59:47.120 doesn't have the node modules, right?
02:59:49.279 First it needs to install your
02:59:51.399 dependencies. So it's going to run mpm
02:59:53.680 install and once it is done it's going
02:59:56.080 to run the server.js file. You can leave
02:59:58.960 this start command as it is or you can
03:00:01.359 say mpm run start. It's the same thing
03:00:04.840 because this mpm run start is going to
03:00:08.720 do the exact same thing right under the
03:00:11.920 start command. Okay. So I'll just leave
03:00:14.080 it in this way and let's say deploy the
03:00:16.960 web
03:00:17.880 service. This will take around one or
03:00:21.439 two minutes and then it should be good
03:00:23.680 to go. So I'll wait once this is done
03:00:26.000 successfully. I'll just be right back.
03:00:28.160 And actually while this is deploying we
03:00:30.479 can copy this URL which is the you know
03:00:33.520 the API URL that render gives us. So
03:00:36.479 I'll copy that. I'll go under the VS
03:00:38.880 code under the
03:00:41.800 transactions actually use transactions.
03:00:44.880 Okay. So we are going to update this
03:00:46.960 part because it's not under the local
03:00:48.960 host anymore. It is under this URL.
03:00:51.920 Right now if you are following along
03:00:53.840 with the simulator you can even like you
03:00:57.040 don't have to do it. You don't have to
03:00:58.720 change this part. You don't have to
03:01:00.319 deploy the API. But this is something
03:01:02.640 that I wanted to show you just in case
03:01:04.880 if you are following along with your
03:01:06.720 physical device. Okay. Now let's save
03:01:09.520 this and let's wait for this to
03:01:11.439 complete. It says your service is live.
03:01:14.720 Server is up and running and database
03:01:17.359 connected successfully. Now let's try to
03:01:20.359 actually test this out from our physical
03:01:23.279 device as well as the simulator. Okay.
03:01:26.240 So I'll just save this code and kill the
03:01:29.040 back end which we don't really have
03:01:30.840 already. I'll open up the application.
03:01:33.600 Let's say cd into the mobile. I'll say
03:01:36.160 mpx
03:01:37.800 expo. We can kill the back end and I'll
03:01:41.040 just say put them side by side. Reload
03:01:43.680 the app. It should be working out
03:01:45.319 correctly. Okay. So we can fetch those
03:01:47.840 from our deployed API, right? It is
03:01:50.479 coming from the deployed API. And if you
03:01:52.960 refresh this, this should say live. Here
03:01:55.439 we go. Now I'll open up my camera and
03:01:58.160 try to test this out from my actual
03:02:00.800 physical device. So here I'll go ahead
03:02:03.439 and scan the QR
03:02:09.399 code. Now my phone is sending the
03:02:12.319 request to this URL instead of local
03:02:14.960 host. So that means we don't really get
03:02:17.040 that network uh error, right? So it it
03:02:20.560 can actually fetch the data now even
03:02:22.880 though we don't we don't really display
03:02:25.120 it in the UI. We didn't get any errors.
03:02:28.240 Let's try to display it pretty quickly
03:02:30.399 under the homepage. Um just to double
03:02:33.359 check it is working correctly and you're
03:02:35.760 happy with it. So here I can maybe right
03:02:40.399 after the hello text I could say create
03:02:43.600 one more
03:02:45.000 text I'll just get the summary itself
03:02:48.479 and let's say we'll display the income
03:02:51.520 and let me say this is the income let's
03:02:54.880 do the same thing for
03:03:01.240 balance and let's do it for the
03:03:03.439 expenses.
03:03:06.690 [Music]
03:03:07.800 this. Okay, I'll save and let me open up
03:03:11.120 my camera once
03:03:13.399 again. So, I can see it on the UI. It is
03:03:17.040 right here. We got the balance, income,
03:03:20.000 and expenses. And it's the exact same
03:03:22.319 value that we have in the terminal under
03:03:25.359 the database. Okay, so that was the
03:03:28.720 solution. you know we had to update this
03:03:31.920 part if we are following from our
03:03:34.399 physical device but if we are using the
03:03:37.439 simulator we don't really need to do it
03:03:39.840 so this is something uh this is
03:03:42.240 something that I wanted to mention and
03:03:44.000 show you this under this section and now
03:03:46.880 I'll change this to be actually local
03:03:49.600 host because I am using the simulator
03:03:52.319 now there is one more problem by the way
03:03:54.080 before I change this this API is going
03:03:57.040 to be inactive every 15 minutes because
03:04:01.120 we are using the free plan, right? The
03:04:03.520 only downside with the free plan is that
03:04:05.840 it'll go inactive. Now, what does that
03:04:08.080 mean? Let's say for 15 minutes you don't
03:04:11.120 send a request. After 15 minutes, you
03:04:14.160 sent a request to your API, it's going
03:04:16.640 to take around 1 or 2 minutes for this
03:04:20.080 to load. So here it says your free
03:04:22.800 instance will spin down with inactivity
03:04:25.359 which is going to cause some delays
03:04:29.040 about 15 seconds or even more. So how
03:04:32.240 can we fix this without paying anything?
03:04:34.720 So there is something called chrome
03:04:36.640 jobs. Let me pretty quickly show you the
03:04:39.359 solution. I will go under the back end.
03:04:42.160 I will create a file called
03:04:45.240 chrome.js. And here I'll say under the
03:04:49.200 back end. So let me say go under the
03:04:51.680 back end and just say mpm install the
03:04:56.240 chrome package. So this is going to
03:04:58.880 install that. And you can find this file
03:05:01.920 from the source code or actually from
03:05:04.160 the GitHub. So let's find that. I'll say
03:05:08.399 just github.com. You can find the link
03:05:10.479 in the
03:05:12.200 description. Um let's see where that is.
03:05:16.720 you can find the chrome.js file. Just
03:05:20.080 copy
03:05:21.319 everything and we're going to paste it.
03:05:24.319 So like what are chrome jobs? I'll
03:05:26.640 explain it pretty quickly. So they are
03:05:28.960 some scheduled tasks that run
03:05:30.880 periodically at fixed intervals. And in
03:05:33.600 our case, we want to send one get
03:05:35.840 request for every 14 minutes so that our
03:05:39.200 API doesn't go inactive. so that it is
03:05:42.000 always up and running and it doesn't
03:05:44.560 really get inactive right so when we
03:05:46.720 send the request we can immediately get
03:05:49.359 response back so here are some examples
03:05:52.319 I don't really want to waste any time I
03:05:54.399 have explained this previously multiple
03:05:56.399 times you can check this out but
03:05:58.720 basically our code is super simple on
03:06:01.680 every 14 minutes we would like to send a
03:06:04.640 request to our API URL which is going to
03:06:08.040 be this URL so copy yours. Okay, I'll
03:06:12.000 copy that and then I'll paste it under
03:06:14.720 the
03:06:16.439 environment. So here I'll say edit add a
03:06:20.240 new one new variable
03:06:23.240 API URL and paste this value
03:06:27.640 in and if it is done successfully we're
03:06:30.640 going to put the console log in the else
03:06:32.560 case we'll just say you know whatever
03:06:34.560 the status code is. So yeah that's
03:06:36.800 entire code. Now we created this file
03:06:39.120 but we never run this. So here I'll go
03:06:41.920 under the server.js and I will import
03:06:45.359 this. Let's say import job from
03:06:49.000 chrome.js. And here I'll say
03:06:52.359 if like actually I'll just say rund
03:06:56.960 chrome sorry
03:07:00.040 job. I only want to start this if we are
03:07:03.040 in production. So here I'll say if
03:07:08.200 process
03:07:10.760 envord if it is equal to production
03:07:14.080 which means if we are deployed if we are
03:07:16.399 in the production environment only then
03:07:18.880 start the chron job right we don't
03:07:21.359 really need to run this locally and I
03:07:23.840 would like to create one more route for
03:07:26.240 testing purposes here I'll say app dot
03:07:29.279 get we can say something like / ai/hel
03:07:33.760 So this is to check if our API is
03:07:36.160 running correctly. I'll say request and
03:07:39.000 response and we can say something like
03:07:41.760 rest status of 200 let's say JSON and we
03:07:47.120 can just say
03:07:48.520 status is
03:07:51.319 okay. Okay. Now we have some changes. We
03:07:54.399 would like to deploy this to GitHub. And
03:07:57.680 I'll copy this part as well because I
03:08:00.880 would like to add it right here. So
03:08:03.120 whatever our API URL is, we'll say /
03:08:07.479 API/halth. Okay, I'll say save, rebuild,
03:08:10.800 and
03:08:14.040 deploy. And then I would like to change
03:08:16.880 this code. Sorry, I would like to push
03:08:18.960 this code to GitHub. Under the back end,
03:08:21.520 I'll say get
03:08:23.800 add
03:08:25.479 commit-m. Let's say chron.js
03:08:29.319 added. and I'll say get
03:08:35.560 push. Let's see where that
03:08:38.840 is. We just got the new changes and this
03:08:43.359 should redeploy that. So just go into
03:08:45.520 the dashboard here. We can see it is
03:08:47.760 deploying
03:08:49.399 it. The previous deploy has been
03:08:52.000 cancelled because this new one is going
03:08:54.800 to be deployed. So let's wait for this
03:08:57.120 to be completed
03:08:58.600 successfully. All right. So it is done
03:09:00.800 successfully. It is live and everything
03:09:03.600 should be working out as expected. Now
03:09:05.760 we don't really need to run the back end
03:09:07.840 from this terminal if you are using the
03:09:09.920 physical phone. But since I am using the
03:09:12.319 simulator, I will actually run that and
03:09:15.279 I will update this part with the local
03:09:17.359 host. So I'll comment this out,
03:09:19.359 duplicate that. And let me say this is
03:09:21.760 going to be local
03:09:24.920 host. All right. So that's it for this
03:09:27.359 section. Now you're able to follow along
03:09:29.680 with me with your physical device if you
03:09:31.840 don't have the simulator. So this is
03:09:33.760 something that I wanted to add and we
03:09:35.760 have an error because I'm not running
03:09:37.359 the back end. Let's try to run this.
03:09:40.000 Let's say mpm
03:09:42.200 rundev and reload our mobile
03:09:45.479 phone. It should be working out
03:09:47.520 correctly. Here we go. So that's it for
03:09:50.560 this section. I'll see you in the next
03:09:52.160 one where we will get started with the
03:09:54.479 homepage UI design. All right. So this
03:09:57.439 is where we left. Now let's build the
03:09:59.279 homepage UI design. For this we'll go
03:10:02.000 under the index.js file and let's try to
03:10:05.840 delete these console logs that we don't
03:10:07.760 really need and we can get started with
03:10:10.080 the loading state. So here I'll say if
03:10:12.880 it is loading we can return a page
03:10:16.399 loader component. Let's say page loader
03:10:19.680 which is something that we will create
03:10:21.600 under the
03:10:23.080 [Music]
03:10:26.279 components let's say JSX. Now this is
03:10:29.600 going to be using a component called
03:10:32.000 activity indicator. So basically we have
03:10:34.560 a view that is taking this loading
03:10:37.200 container style that is coming from home
03:10:39.920 styles and then we are using this
03:10:42.319 component coming from React Native. So
03:10:45.120 let's save and we'll see the output. and
03:10:47.760 let's try to import
03:10:50.040 it. Okay. So this is what we have while
03:10:52.880 it is in the loading state. This is what
03:10:55.279 you will see. I'll just make it true so
03:10:57.200 that you can see it. Now you can change
03:10:59.279 it. Now you can change the size. Let's
03:11:01.840 say small. We have large. I think we
03:11:05.520 have only large and small. I thought we
03:11:07.120 also had medium but I'll go with the
03:11:09.200 large. You can change the color as well.
03:11:11.920 Here we are using the primary color but
03:11:14.479 you could use anything that you wish.
03:11:16.880 Okay, so that's it for this component.
03:11:19.760 Now we can get started with the actual
03:11:22.240 UI if we don't have the loading state,
03:11:25.120 right? So we need to fix this part. The
03:11:28.319 very first thing I'd like to add is this
03:11:30.560 header component where we have the icon,
03:11:33.279 the username, and two different
03:11:37.319 buttons. So let's try to put them side
03:11:39.840 by side and get started with it. Now I
03:11:42.240 will delete everything that we have
03:11:43.760 under this view. Let's say this is going
03:11:46.160 to take the style and from the styles
03:11:50.319 which is coming from the homepage I mean
03:11:52.800 home styles we'll say get the container
03:11:55.520 class and then we can add one more view
03:11:58.560 let's say this will take the
03:12:01.399 style styles doc
03:12:04.760 content and then we can put the header
03:12:07.520 component so here I'll just say header
03:12:10.319 I'll have one more view let's say style
03:12:14.880 is going to be styles header and then we
03:12:18.000 can build the left hand side. So I'll
03:12:20.080 say header left and then we'll have the
03:12:23.040 right side. So this is the left and then
03:12:26.720 this is the
03:12:29.640 right. Okay. So under the left I will
03:12:32.640 have again a view. This is going to take
03:12:35.840 the class name or sorry is it's going to
03:12:38.560 take the style called styles. header
03:12:42.560 left and then we can put the logo which
03:12:45.920 is going to be an image that I'd like to
03:12:48.240 provide. Let's say import the image. I
03:12:51.120 think this is going to be coming from
03:12:52.640 React Native. You can also use the expo
03:12:55.439 but we are basically getting the logo.
03:12:58.399 Let's save. Okay, we just got the image.
03:13:02.240 And then right after the logo, we can
03:13:04.319 put the welcome container. So instead of
03:13:07.200 typing this out, I'll paste around four
03:13:09.680 lines of code. And let me walk you
03:13:11.520 through it. We have a view with a text
03:13:14.560 that says welcome and then we grab the
03:13:17.439 username. Now this is basically coming
03:13:19.840 from the clerk user. We are getting the
03:13:23.040 email address. So let's say email
03:13:25.680 address is this
03:13:28.520 one
03:13:30.439 atgmail.com. Oops. Let's say we are
03:13:34.000 getting the part before the add symbol.
03:13:36.880 So this is how we do it with the split
03:13:38.880 method.
03:13:40.720 So that's why we can see the very first
03:13:42.880 part as the username and then right
03:13:45.600 after this view after the header left we
03:13:48.640 can put the header
03:13:50.920 right. So here I'll go ahead create a
03:13:53.840 view and let me actually copy and paste
03:13:56.000 and I'll walk you through
03:13:57.720 it. We have a touchable opacity. Let's
03:14:00.560 import it. When we click to it, it'll
03:14:02.800 take us to the create page. Let's get
03:14:05.279 the router as well as the ion icons.
03:14:09.520 So here I'll say const router that'll be
03:14:12.880 coming from use
03:14:14.439 router from clerk sorry not clerk but
03:14:18.120 expo let's say use
03:14:20.920 router from expo router just import that
03:14:24.239 and then let's get the ion icons from
03:14:27.120 expo vector
03:14:28.840 icons. Now let's save and what we're
03:14:31.600 going to see.
03:14:33.359 Okay. So, we can see the add
03:14:35.479 button which is going to take this icon.
03:14:38.560 Now, we can add more different things
03:14:40.960 like add
03:14:43.399 circle right you can go with anything
03:14:45.840 but I'll go with the add and color is
03:14:48.319 going to be white and then I'd like to
03:14:50.319 fix this sign up button so that it looks
03:14:53.680 it look like this with an icon. So here
03:14:57.279 I'll visit this component which is
03:14:59.600 coming from the
03:15:02.040 components. Okay. Why I cannot visit
03:15:04.399 that? Let me just say sign out button
03:15:07.840 and fix
03:15:09.239 it. Fix the UI and then the
03:15:11.439 functionality. So actually the function
03:15:13.439 works correctly. All we have to do just
03:15:15.520 update the return statement. So we'll
03:15:18.080 have a touchable opacity with the on
03:15:20.080 press but on top of it I will add the
03:15:22.560 style. Let's say styles which is going
03:15:25.760 to be coming from both styles or I think
03:15:29.200 from the home styles. Let's import that.
03:15:32.000 Um I'll say styles do logo button. And
03:15:35.840 then for the text we will have the ion
03:15:40.600 icons. Import this. We'll give a name.
03:15:44.800 I'll use the blog
03:15:48.520 outline. And then I'll say size is going
03:15:51.120 to be 22.
03:15:53.319 colors color could be from the colors we
03:15:56.960 will get the text
03:15:58.920 color okay so this is the output that we
03:16:01.600 have now when we clicked it I don't want
03:16:03.920 to log out immediately I would like to
03:16:06.479 ask for a confirmation so what I'll be
03:16:09.279 doing is to delete this try and catch
03:16:11.760 block here I'll say alert dot alert and
03:16:16.080 there's also prompt but I'll be using
03:16:18.000 the alert here we'll just say first put
03:16:21.600 the title I'll say log out and then we
03:16:25.200 can put the message here. I'll say are
03:16:28.720 you
03:16:30.120 sure you want to log
03:16:33.319 out and then we'll have the actions. So
03:16:36.800 here we'll have two different buttons
03:16:39.040 which is going to be an object. Let's
03:16:40.800 say the text is going to be cancel and
03:16:43.760 then the style which can be cancel,
03:16:46.720 default or destructive. This is going to
03:16:49.040 be cancel. And we can duplicate this.
03:16:52.000 This time it'll say log out. So you will
03:16:55.279 see the output just in a second. Style
03:16:57.359 could be
03:16:58.840 destructive. Let's get this and then on
03:17:01.600 press. So once you click it, we would
03:17:03.920 like to call the sign out from clerk.
03:17:07.120 Okay, let's actually give it a go. I'll
03:17:09.279 click it. We got the confirmation thanks
03:17:11.920 to this alert. If you say cancel,
03:17:14.319 nothing would happen. But if you say log
03:17:16.720 out, you should be logged out. Okay. So
03:17:19.680 that means everything is working
03:17:21.120 correctly. I'll just try to log
03:17:25.880 in and then we can build the balance
03:17:29.479 card which is going to be this
03:17:31.840 component. So this is what I call the
03:17:33.920 balance card. You can call this anything
03:17:36.439 else but this is the name that I'll be
03:17:38.880 going with. So right after all these
03:17:41.960 views, so after the header but still
03:17:44.800 within the content here, we'll just say
03:17:48.000 create the balance
03:17:51.800 card. And we would like to pass the
03:17:54.239 summary into
03:17:57.140 [Music]
03:17:58.760 it. Let's try to create this component.
03:18:01.760 Under the components, I'll say balance
03:18:05.640 card.jsx. Now this doesn't contain any
03:18:08.319 logic at all. So I would like to copy
03:18:10.479 and paste. Please don't get don't get
03:18:12.640 mad. You can copy this from the repo
03:18:16.080 right from the source code. But
03:18:18.720 basically we just have some styles and
03:18:20.800 then some text. We display the balance,
03:18:23.920 the income, and then the you know the
03:18:27.000 expenses. Okay, let's save and try to
03:18:29.760 import
03:18:32.120 that. Hopefully it should be working out
03:18:34.640 as expected. There we go. And then after
03:18:37.359 the balance card, we can put this text
03:18:40.239 where it says recent
03:18:42.760 transactions. So right after the balance
03:18:45.760 card, I'll paste this in. We have a view
03:18:48.479 with a text with these classes. And this
03:18:51.439 is our title. Now it is time to actually
03:18:54.239 display our
03:18:55.800 transactions. So here we have bunch of
03:18:58.080 different transactions that we would
03:18:59.520 like to display. And for this we'll be
03:19:01.920 using something called flat list. Now if
03:19:04.720 you remember back in the tutorial I have
03:19:07.279 actually talked about it here. We said
03:19:09.920 when it comes to lists in React web we
03:19:13.279 would do things like you know array.m
03:19:15.600 map and for each item display this UI.
03:19:19.120 In this case we would like to use the
03:19:21.200 flat list in React Native for
03:19:23.680 performance reasons. So we'll explain
03:19:26.479 what they are. But first let's try to go
03:19:29.920 outside of this content. So just shrink
03:19:33.200 the content and go below to it. We will
03:19:36.399 have the flat list component that is
03:19:39.920 like the flat list component that we
03:19:42.479 import from React Native. So it is this
03:19:45.520 one that we got. This will take a couple
03:19:48.560 of different props. First let's add the
03:19:51.000 style. I'll say it's going to be styles
03:19:54.479 dot transactions list. And then we can
03:19:58.160 give the content container style as
03:20:00.640 well. This is going to be style
03:20:03.319 dot say styles.t transaction list
03:20:07.160 content which is going to take some
03:20:09.920 petting from the bottom and then we can
03:20:12.479 add the data that we would like to map
03:20:14.720 through which is the transactions array.
03:20:17.520 So why are we using the flat list in the
03:20:20.080 first place? I'll just add two different
03:20:22.399 comments. So flat list is a performant
03:20:25.200 way to render long lists in React
03:20:27.920 Native. It renders items lazily, only
03:20:31.279 those on the screen. Now, what does that
03:20:33.520 mean? Let's say in our database, we have
03:20:36.319 five different transactions. We fetched
03:20:39.279 all of them, but at the moment, we can
03:20:41.680 only see five different transactions,
03:20:44.479 right? We only see five. So, we don't
03:20:46.880 really want to render the remaining
03:20:49.960 495 transactions. So, flat list will
03:20:53.760 will be doing this exact same thing. So
03:20:56.000 it is going to only render the ones on
03:20:58.399 the screen. The other ones that are not
03:21:00.640 on screen will not be rendered. Only as
03:21:04.080 you scroll it is going to render them
03:21:06.640 which is going to boost the performance.
03:21:09.520 So this is something really important to
03:21:11.600 keep in mind. The flat list component is
03:21:14.720 you know using it in this way is a lot
03:21:16.720 different than doing something like
03:21:19.399 transactions.map and for each
03:21:21.279 transaction you know do something. This
03:21:23.920 is a lot different than flat list in the
03:21:26.319 performant way. Okay. So we got the
03:21:29.439 transactions. Now we will say for every
03:21:32.279 transaction just go ahead and render
03:21:34.720 item where it is this callback function.
03:21:38.800 So we'll just say dstructure the item.
03:21:41.359 So this is what you would get by
03:21:42.800 default. The react native called this as
03:21:45.680 item. So this is basically each
03:21:48.239 transaction and we would like to render
03:21:51.120 something. So here I'll put brackets and
03:21:54.160 I'll say just go below so that we can
03:21:57.040 have a bit space. I'll say render the
03:21:59.520 transaction item
03:22:02.600 component which is something that we
03:22:04.800 will create just in a
03:22:06.600 second. Okay. So we will pass the
03:22:09.710 [Music]
03:22:10.840 item and then on delete I will send the
03:22:15.920 handle delete function. Again, this is
03:22:18.720 something that we will create in a
03:22:20.239 second. But first, let's try to create
03:22:22.640 this component. So, under the
03:22:24.560 components, let me go under the mobile.
03:22:26.880 Under the components, I'll say
03:22:31.560 transaction item.jsx file. Now, once
03:22:35.520 again, this doesn't really contain any
03:22:37.520 logic. I'd like to copy and paste and
03:22:39.920 walk you through it. It's around 50
03:22:41.920 lines of code. So we got our imports and
03:22:44.960 we got a constant that we will take a
03:22:47.200 look at it. Basically this will display
03:22:49.520 an icon depending on the category. So if
03:22:52.560 the category is food and drinks you
03:22:55.279 would see this icon, right? If it is
03:22:57.760 bills you would see this icon. For
03:23:00.239 income for the other category so on and
03:23:03.279 so
03:23:04.040 forth. To be able to make that work we
03:23:06.800 create this object.
03:23:09.120 So this is the category and then the
03:23:11.200 icon name. So if it is income which we
03:23:14.239 can check like if it is a positive value
03:23:17.279 it is income and if it is like if it is
03:23:21.040 negative it is expense and then we got
03:23:23.600 the icon name depending on the item
03:23:26.600 category. Then finally we can display
03:23:29.040 it. So let's actually take a look at it.
03:23:32.000 I'll just zoom
03:23:33.479 out. We have the view with the icon. So
03:23:37.439 this will determine what what you have
03:23:39.920 on the left hand side and then the title
03:23:42.720 let's say the
03:23:44.040 category. So title, category and then on
03:23:47.520 the right hand side we have this amount
03:23:50.640 and we are adding either plus or minus
03:23:54.399 depending on the you know depending on
03:23:57.279 the category if it is expense or if it
03:24:00.319 is an income then the created
03:24:03.560 date and for this we are importing the
03:24:06.399 format date
03:24:08.200 function from the utils. So this is
03:24:11.359 something that we have created in the
03:24:13.120 past.
03:24:14.640 Okay, finally when you click to this
03:24:16.880 delete icon, you are going to call the
03:24:21.239 ondelete with the item ID. So I hope
03:24:25.200 this is not really confusing. This is
03:24:27.200 super basic React. Basically we have
03:24:29.600 bunch of different components and we
03:24:31.600 display some data and adding some styles
03:24:34.319 just to make it look nice. Okay, so you
03:24:36.880 can pause the video, type this out and
03:24:39.279 try to understand what is happening.
03:24:41.439 Once you have done this, we can
03:24:45.040 uh actually import
03:24:46.680 this. Now for the handle delete, let's
03:24:49.600 try to create it. It's a pretty basic
03:24:52.120 function where basically I would like to
03:24:54.800 ask for a confirmation here. I'll say
03:24:57.680 const handle delete and I can zoom in.
03:25:02.380 [Music]
03:25:05.520 So this will be a function where we get
03:25:08.479 the
03:25:11.720 ID and I'll just add an alert just like
03:25:15.200 what we have done in the signage
03:25:18.040 file. So delete transaction are you
03:25:20.960 sure? If so just go ahead call the
03:25:23.359 method in the cancel case. Don't do
03:25:25.880 anything. Now I'll click to it and I
03:25:29.439 think like these icons does not really
03:25:31.920 work. We will fix it. So I'll try to
03:25:34.560 delete this one. Say cancel, nothing
03:25:36.960 happens. But if I say
03:25:39.640 delete. It says success and page has
03:25:43.040 been refreshed. So that means it is
03:25:45.279 working correctly. Now when it comes to
03:25:47.600 icons, it doesn't really work because in
03:25:51.279 the database for the category, we just
03:25:53.840 have income and expense, right? But they
03:25:56.479 should actually be something like you
03:25:59.439 know transportation, shopping,
03:26:01.760 entertainment, so on and so forth. Let's
03:26:04.160 try to fix them. I'll go under the
03:26:06.640 database. Let's
03:26:09.399 refresh. Here for the expense, I'll say
03:26:14.439 transportation. And then for the income,
03:26:16.800 we can just say income but with
03:26:18.880 uppercase
03:26:21.160 I. Save the changes and take a look at
03:26:24.239 the output.
03:26:26.160 Um, I'll refresh. Oops. Open up the
03:26:29.120 terminal and refresh this
03:26:33.960 page. Okay. So, icons have been updated
03:26:37.479 because like it check with this object.
03:26:40.960 If it is transportation, you will get
03:26:43.040 the car icon. If it is income, you would
03:26:45.680 get the cash
03:26:48.120 icon. Now, we could add more props to
03:26:50.960 the flat list. So what happens if we
03:26:53.760 have an empty list? So I'll say list
03:26:56.319 empty content. In this case we can show
03:26:59.439 something like no transactions
03:27:02.840 found which is a component that we will
03:27:06.359 create. So do I have any images for
03:27:09.560 that? Looks like I don't but if we don't
03:27:12.160 have any transactions we will say
03:27:14.239 something like you don't have anything
03:27:16.160 go ahead and create one. So let's try to
03:27:19.200 create this under the
03:27:21.000 components. I'll say JSX again content
03:27:24.960 is only UI no logic at all. I'd like to
03:27:28.479 paste this around 30 lines of code. So
03:27:32.000 when user clicks when user clicks to
03:27:35.040 this touchable opacity we will take them
03:27:37.040 to the create page. Let's save and give
03:27:39.600 it a go. Import this. And here I'll say
03:27:43.040 the transactions is an empty array just
03:27:45.359 to test this out. And this is the output
03:27:47.760 that we have. If you clicked it, you'll
03:27:49.920 be under the create page, which we don't
03:27:52.399 have at the
03:27:53.640 moment. Okay. But for now, let's bring
03:27:56.080 this
03:27:57.000 back and try to add different props. So
03:28:00.560 here, I'll say shows vertical scroll
03:28:03.720 indicator. We don't really want to show
03:28:06.000 the scroll indicator. So I'll just say
03:28:08.359 false. So that it is never visible on
03:28:11.279 iOS or Android. But we can still scroll
03:28:14.319 through this component, even though
03:28:15.840 indicator is not really visible. Now, I
03:28:18.160 don't know if you have realized, but we
03:28:19.840 have a different behavior. So, it it is
03:28:22.160 kind of strange. Now, when you reload
03:28:24.239 the app, even though we are logged in,
03:28:26.800 it first shows us the sign-in page for a
03:28:30.000 split second. So, I'll refresh. So,
03:28:32.160 first we see the welcome back page and
03:28:34.399 then we are navigated to here. So to be
03:28:37.279 able to fix that I will go under the
03:28:39.680 root hut and I'll say you know first
03:28:43.439 kill the left hand side let's say get
03:28:45.760 the is loaded from clerk and I'll say if
03:28:49.439 it is not loaded if clerk is not loaded
03:28:52.720 please don't return anything so that I
03:28:54.880 don't have this different this strange
03:28:57.359 behavior. Now I'll refresh. So
03:29:00.319 immediately we would see the loading
03:29:02.800 spinner instead of the signin page.
03:29:05.600 Okay. So I'll add a comment. Let me just
03:29:08.520 say this is for a better user experience
03:29:14.560 and save this file. Now just before we
03:29:17.520 end this section, I'd like to show you
03:29:19.439 one last thing which is about the
03:29:21.760 refresh functionality. So when we do
03:29:24.560 this thing, it should refresh, right?
03:29:26.880 How can we add this functionality? Well,
03:29:29.359 basically under the flat list, we have
03:29:31.840 something called refresh control. So
03:29:34.239 here I'll say refresh control and I'll
03:29:36.720 say refresh control this from react
03:29:40.160 native and then this is going to take
03:29:42.239 the refreshing state. Let's say it's
03:29:45.200 equal to refreshing which is something
03:29:47.680 we will create and then on refresh
03:29:50.840 function let's say on refresh and paste
03:29:54.479 this in okay so these are the things
03:29:56.880 that we will create. If you delete them,
03:29:59.359 let's see what'll
03:30:03.160 happen. Like nothing happens. It
03:30:05.920 actually breaks the application. So
03:30:08.080 let's reload
03:30:12.840 it. And I will print this back with Ctrl
03:30:17.239 C. Now let's try to create those. So
03:30:20.479 this is going to be a state and this is
03:30:22.479 going to be a function. I'll just scroll
03:30:24.800 to the top. I'll say const
03:30:27.960 refreshing set
03:30:32.600 refreshing let's say use state if I can
03:30:36.319 type
03:30:38.840 correctly by default this is going to be
03:30:41.439 equal to false once we refresh that
03:30:44.080 we'll make it to be true and now let's
03:30:46.239 create our function called on refresh so
03:30:50.080 on refresh is going to be an async
03:30:52.399 function where we would like to update
03:30:54.399 the state we'll say set refreshing to be
03:30:58.040 true and then we would like to fetch the
03:31:01.439 data. So we would like to load the data
03:31:03.840 from scratch because we are refreshing
03:31:06.560 and then once this is done we'll say set
03:31:09.120 refreshing to be equal to
03:31:11.560 false. Okay. So I'll save and let's give
03:31:14.080 it a go. I'll refresh. Now here we can
03:31:17.680 see it is refreshing but since loading
03:31:20.720 state has been updated we can see the
03:31:23.040 entire page loader. To get rid of this
03:31:25.920 I'll say if you are loading and if you
03:31:28.640 are not refreshing only then show the
03:31:31.600 page loader. Now here we can see the
03:31:35.359 page lo sorry the refresh control
03:31:38.920 itself. Now let's actually see if it is
03:31:41.840 getting the latest data. So, I will go
03:31:44.160 ahead update the expense in the
03:31:46.880 database. Let's say it'll be just
03:31:51.640 1,000, save the change, and try to
03:31:56.120 refresh. Okay, here we can see it's been
03:31:58.800 just updated. So, with this out of the
03:32:01.040 way, I think we have completed the
03:32:02.880 entire homepage where we have the header
03:32:05.680 component, we got the balance card, and
03:32:08.239 then the transactions. And for this we
03:32:10.560 have used the flat list which is a
03:32:12.720 really cool component for the
03:32:15.040 performance optimizations. Okay. So with
03:32:17.840 that in the next section we're going to
03:32:19.520 get started with the create
03:32:21.560 page. Now it is time to get started with
03:32:24.479 the create screen where we have a header
03:32:27.120 component at the top that we can go back
03:32:29.439 to the homepage or we can save the
03:32:31.680 transaction. So we have two different
03:32:33.760 selections, right? And then two
03:32:35.920 different input elements and then the
03:32:38.160 category grid. So with this in mind,
03:32:40.720 let's get started with it. We would like
03:32:43.040 to create a file called create. So I
03:32:47.120 will create it under the root. This is
03:32:49.279 this is going to be our
03:32:52.840 screen. Okay, I'll just shrink the left
03:32:55.439 hand side and let's say
03:32:58.120 RNF. Let's try to you know format this.
03:33:02.000 I'll just say create
03:33:04.200 screen and then get started with it. Now
03:33:07.439 I'll give you like an array of
03:33:10.279 categories. So we have the ID, name, and
03:33:13.640 icon. So we'll be using this array to
03:33:16.239 display these items, right? So in total
03:33:18.800 we have I think seven different items.
03:33:21.760 So this is exactly what we have. So
03:33:23.840 we'll use this in a couple of minutes.
03:33:26.080 And then I'd like to get the use router
03:33:28.800 from export router. I'll paste this in.
03:33:31.840 Let's import it. I'll just scroll to the
03:33:34.640 top. I'll say
03:33:38.040 import from expo router. And then I'd
03:33:41.600 like to get the use user from
03:33:46.840 clerk because we would like to get the
03:33:49.359 user object. This is the currently
03:33:51.359 authenticated user, right? So I'll get
03:33:53.840 it from clerk clerk expo and then I'll
03:33:56.720 add couple of different states. So let
03:33:59.680 me import the use state from React. So
03:34:02.800 we are going to keep track of the title,
03:34:04.720 the amount, selected category if it is
03:34:07.359 an expense or not. And my mouse is I
03:34:09.920 think dying at the moment. The battery
03:34:12.479 should be dying. That's why it is a bit
03:34:14.840 laggy. But let's move on. Okay. If it is
03:34:17.760 an expense or not and the loiting state.
03:34:20.800 So by default the expense will be
03:34:22.960 selected. And then I will create a
03:34:25.279 function called handle create. So this
03:34:28.800 will handle the creation of the
03:34:30.720 transaction. I'll say it'll be an async
03:34:33.319 function where we can get started with
03:34:35.840 it. So first let's fix this. Now first
03:34:39.920 I'd like to add some form validations.
03:34:42.160 Right? So here I'll say
03:34:46.200 validations. I'll add the if check.
03:34:48.399 We'll say if there is no title we'll say
03:34:51.040 please enter a transaction title. And
03:34:53.760 this alert is coming from React Native.
03:34:56.399 And then like I'll have couple of
03:34:58.640 different if checks. First I'll say if
03:35:00.960 amount is not a number or if it is less
03:35:03.840 than zero we'll just say please enter a
03:35:06.880 valid amount. Now if it is if it is an
03:35:09.840 expense we don't want them to put
03:35:11.600 something like you know minus 100.
03:35:15.200 Instead they'll just select the expense
03:35:17.680 and put 100. We will convert this to be
03:35:21.200 minus
03:35:23.160 100. Okay. So this is something to keep
03:35:25.680 in mind. That's why we have this if
03:35:28.120 check. And after this one, I'll add one
03:35:30.640 more thing. So if user did not selected
03:35:33.600 a category, right? If there is no
03:35:35.600 category selected, we'll say please
03:35:37.760 select a category. And then we can
03:35:40.080 actually get started with the logic. So
03:35:42.560 I'll have try, catch, and finally. So in
03:35:46.000 the finally, we'll just update the
03:35:47.760 loading state to be equal to
03:35:50.600 false. And then in the try we will send
03:35:53.600 the request right maybe before here we
03:35:56.160 could just say set is
03:35:58.040 loading to be
03:36:00.040 true. So first I'd like to format the
03:36:03.040 amount. So I'll say formatted amount if
03:36:05.359 it is an expense we will get the value
03:36:07.760 and just put a minus uh in front but
03:36:11.120 else we'll get the absolute value of it.
03:36:13.680 So it'll be positive and then we would
03:36:16.000 like to call the API. So here I'll say
03:36:18.600 const let's say response and I'll say
03:36:22.200 await fetch. Now here we would like to
03:36:25.279 put the API URL which is something that
03:36:28.080 we have used under the use transactions.
03:36:31.279 Now instead of putting it here I will
03:36:33.359 create a file for this. So under the
03:36:36.520 constants I'll just say
03:36:39.960 API.js and I will cut this from here.
03:36:44.080 And just in case you're looking at the
03:36:45.920 source code, I'll leave it here for now
03:36:48.080 as a comment. I'll paste this here and
03:36:51.040 just say export this
03:36:53.399 one. And then here we would like to
03:36:55.760 import this so that the use transactions
03:36:58.560 doesn't
03:36:59.479 fail. And then I'll be using the same
03:37:01.840 thing here on this file. Now it is
03:37:04.080 coming from the
03:37:05.720 API.js. So I'll add my back text. Let's
03:37:09.120 say API URL imported from the constants
03:37:14.279 slashtransactions. We would like to send
03:37:16.160 a post request. So I'll say method is
03:37:19.200 going to be
03:37:21.080 post. And then for the header contents
03:37:24.800 for the header we'll just say you know
03:37:27.439 application JSON we'll send some JSON
03:37:29.760 data and it'll be under the body. Let me
03:37:33.200 paste this in.
03:37:35.200 We will stringify this object where we
03:37:37.840 sent the user ID, title, amount and
03:37:40.640 category. If you take a look at the
03:37:42.720 server.js file under the controller
03:37:46.399 under the post method, these are the
03:37:49.279 fields that we are expecting, right?
03:37:51.279 Title, amount, category, and then the
03:37:53.359 user
03:37:56.279 ID. And then right after this response,
03:38:00.640 so here I'd like to say if response is
03:38:04.080 not okay, that means something went
03:38:06.760 wrong, we can get the error data. So
03:38:10.960 this is what I'll be doing. And then
03:38:12.239 I'll just throw the error so that I can
03:38:14.399 catch it under the catch block. But else
03:38:16.880 we would like to just show a success
03:38:19.920 alert. And then I will take the user
03:38:22.560 back to the homepage. Okay. In the
03:38:25.279 catch, I'll put the console log as well
03:38:28.000 as put an alert with the error
03:38:31.560 message. And we can console log it just
03:38:35.080 like just like this. So that's entire
03:38:38.399 function that we need. Super simple,
03:38:40.640 nothing complex. We just send a fetch
03:38:43.120 request, right? And then we have some
03:38:45.479 validations. Now we would like to call
03:38:47.520 this under the UI when we when we click
03:38:51.120 to this save button. Okay, let's try to
03:38:54.399 build it
03:38:55.800 now. So, first I'll say this view will
03:38:59.040 get the style from the styles and this
03:39:02.399 should be coming from let's import it.
03:39:05.920 I'll say
03:39:07.380 [Music]
03:39:09.479 import. I think this should be wrapped
03:39:12.160 with curly braces and I'll say from
03:39:14.800 let's go one up one more under the
03:39:17.800 constants under the sorry not constants
03:39:20.880 it should be under the assets. Let's
03:39:22.640 find
03:39:23.560 it. So, assets styles and then create
03:39:28.080 page styles. Right? So, here we'll say
03:39:32.439 styles. And then this is not going to be
03:39:34.800 a text, but instead it'll be the view
03:39:37.439 for the
03:39:38.840 header. So, I'll put the comment. Let's
03:39:41.200 say style is going to
03:39:44.439 be
03:39:46.520 styles. Now, instead of typing this out,
03:39:49.040 we have done this multiple times. So I'd
03:39:51.200 like to just paste and walk you through
03:39:52.960 it. So we have the view for the header
03:39:55.680 and then a touchable opacity. Let's
03:39:57.680 import it. And then ion icons. We'll
03:40:00.720 import that as well. Let's get the
03:40:02.680 colors. Then now let's try to import the
03:40:06.319 ion icons. I'll just scroll to the top.
03:40:09.439 Get my import and we can save it and let
03:40:12.800 and then let's take a look at the
03:40:14.080 output. Okay. So this is what we got.
03:40:16.640 This is the back button with the arrow
03:40:18.720 back icon. Then we got the text in
03:40:21.680 middle and then the touchable opacity
03:40:24.160 that will save that will save the
03:40:27.080 transaction. Now we are adding the
03:40:29.200 loading state. So let's say if it was
03:40:31.279 true it is going to be disabled and then
03:40:34.560 if it is like if it was true we would
03:40:37.120 see
03:40:39.560 saving and if it is not loading let's
03:40:42.640 actually say like false or sorry let's
03:40:47.040 say
03:40:48.040 true. So this is what you would see. But
03:40:50.960 for now, let's bring them back. We are
03:40:53.680 going to see this in action once we
03:40:55.200 actually submit the form. And then after
03:40:57.680 the header. So I'll just shrink this.
03:40:59.840 I'll say create one more view with the
03:41:02.560 style to be
03:41:06.520 styles.cart where we would like to put
03:41:08.960 the selector. So I'll say
03:41:12.359 style
03:41:13.880 styles.ype selector. Here we'll have two
03:41:17.200 different selectors. either expense or
03:41:19.040 the income and this entire thing is
03:41:21.920 called as cart
03:41:24.680 right. So this entire thing is
03:41:27.770 [Music]
03:41:30.040 cart. Okay. So under the type selector
03:41:33.439 I'd like to first put the expense
03:41:35.359 selector that will be a touchable
03:41:38.000 opacity. So just paste this in. Let's
03:41:40.640 save. Okay. Right next to it we we would
03:41:44.160 like to put the income
03:41:46.359 selector. So these are the things that
03:41:48.479 we have done multiple times. That's why
03:41:50.720 I'd like to just copy and paste. Let's
03:41:53.520 say income
03:41:57.150 [Music]
03:41:58.680 selector. Let me just walk you through
03:42:00.720 it pretty quickly. We have this style
03:42:03.279 will be applied every single time,
03:42:05.439 right? No matter what happens. But if it
03:42:07.760 is expense only, then this would be
03:42:09.760 applied which says it is active. So that
03:42:12.319 we can have this styling otherwise this
03:42:14.800 is how it'll look like. Same for the
03:42:17.120 colors and same for this text as
03:42:21.160 well. Okay, it's the exact same thing
03:42:23.520 for the income selector. Now, we would
03:42:25.840 like to put the amount container. So,
03:42:29.040 right after the touchable opacity and
03:42:31.279 after this view, which is the type
03:42:36.120 selector, we will paste the amount
03:42:38.680 container. Let's import the text input.
03:42:42.160 Okay, so this is the UI. So we have the
03:42:44.880 amount as the state for the value and on
03:42:47.840 change we will update that state and the
03:42:49.920 keyboard type is numeric. So if you say
03:42:52.319 command shift K you will see that the
03:42:55.040 keyboard is actually
03:42:57.399 numeric. Okay. And then right after the
03:43:00.720 amount container we'll have the input
03:43:02.960 container. Let me copy and paste. So
03:43:06.160 right after this one. So please feel
03:43:08.800 free to pause the video and type this
03:43:10.600 out. Super simple. No logic at all.
03:43:14.000 Right after the input container, we can
03:43:16.399 put the
03:43:17.800 title for the
03:43:20.279 category. Okay. Now we are going to map
03:43:22.640 through the categories which is this
03:43:24.720 array that we have at the very
03:43:27.479 top. So right after the text I will have
03:43:30.560 a view. Let me give a little bit space.
03:43:33.520 This will take the style as the
03:43:37.000 styles.category grid. Now here I'll just
03:43:40.000 say category or sorry categories do map.
03:43:43.520 Let's get every single category and for
03:43:46.399 them we would like to return this
03:43:48.720 content which is going to be a touchable
03:43:51.120 opacity. I'll paste this in. Let's save
03:43:54.080 and give it a go. Now if it is selected
03:43:57.040 okay my mouse is really annoying. If it
03:44:00.080 is selected as you can tell styles have
03:44:02.800 been updated
03:44:05.080 right. So these styles are coming from
03:44:08.080 these lines where we say if it is the
03:44:10.560 selected category go ahead make it
03:44:13.120 active. Same for the color right if it
03:44:15.680 is selected make the color to be white
03:44:18.640 otherwise it'll be this text color
03:44:21.120 otherwise it is white right either white
03:44:23.760 or this text color and same for the
03:44:27.600 let's see for the text right okay so
03:44:30.960 that's the entire UI I think right after
03:44:34.479 these views so just uh above the
03:44:37.600 container I'd like to paste this in
03:44:39.840 where we would like to put an activity
03:44:41.840 indicator
03:44:43.760 So if it is in the aloing state, I'll
03:44:46.000 just say
03:44:47.560 true. Okay, what is happening? So I just
03:44:50.640 realized this should be activity
03:44:52.239 indicator not based. So let's delete
03:44:54.960 that. And now it should be working out
03:44:57.319 correctly. So if we are in the loading
03:44:59.520 state, we would like to see this for a
03:45:01.600 split second. Let's say is loading. So
03:45:05.680 we have built everything. Let's give it
03:45:07.439 a go. I'll say I'll have an expense for
03:45:10.319 food and drinks. Let's say it is 100 and
03:45:13.920 I'll
03:45:14.920 say you know uh let's say KFC and I'll
03:45:19.720 save. Okay, looks like it failed. Do I
03:45:22.479 have my back end
03:45:25.239 running? Yes, I have. Let's see. It says
03:45:28.319 failed to
03:45:31.720 create. So why this is the case? Let's
03:45:34.239 see. So I just paused the video and put
03:45:37.120 a console log right here. And when I say
03:45:40.040 save on the terminal, I see that it says
03:45:43.359 all fields are required. So let's see
03:45:46.399 visit the server.js file. Here under the
03:45:50.000 post method, we are expecting user ID.
03:45:54.640 But here we just sent user ID. Right,
03:45:57.760 let's make this to be user ID and test
03:46:01.680 this out. Hopefully it should work out.
03:46:03.840 I'll say
03:46:05.239 save. Okay, now we got the success
03:46:07.760 message. If we refresh this page, it is
03:46:10.319 right here. And of course, it would be
03:46:12.640 in the database as well. So, it has just
03:46:16.080 been
03:46:17.080 created. Okay. Now, let's open up our
03:46:19.560 application. Let's try to add one more
03:46:21.840 thing which is going to be income. This
03:46:24.080 was an expense as you can
03:46:26.680 tell. Let's say income. I'll say
03:46:29.680 something like 1,500. Let's say salary.
03:46:34.630 [Music]
03:46:36.239 Let's say income and
03:46:40.760 save. Balance has been updated. It is
03:46:43.640 added. Let's
03:46:45.880 refresh. Okay. So, it is working
03:46:48.160 correctly as well. I'd like to delete
03:46:50.720 one of
03:46:52.600 them. It works uh successfully and we
03:46:56.319 can log out. You know, we can refresh. I
03:46:59.680 think our entire application works
03:47:01.520 correctly without any issues. So, I
03:47:03.920 think that's the entire application. Now
03:47:05.920 just before we end this section, I would
03:47:07.760 like to visit the root layout and I'd
03:47:10.960 like to mention something else. So the
03:47:13.600 root layout is this one. The one that is
03:47:16.720 directly under the app, right? So here I
03:47:19.600 will add the status bar. I would like to
03:47:22.399 say get the status bar component, but
03:47:25.279 I'd like to import it from expo. I think
03:47:27.520 it's a lot a lot better to use. Let's
03:47:30.319 say expo status bar. Now we can add the
03:47:33.439 style because currently this is in the
03:47:35.760 light mode which is not really visible.
03:47:37.840 So this is white. I don't know if you
03:47:39.680 can see it from the video but I can
03:47:41.279 barely see it. Here I'll say make this
03:47:43.920 to be in the dark mode. Let's save. Now
03:47:46.720 we can change the theme. Right. We can
03:47:49.040 say
03:47:50.760 light which was the default option. And
03:47:53.520 I think there's also inverted and then
03:47:55.840 auto but I'll go with dark so that it is
03:47:58.800 visible in this theme. And if we change
03:48:01.680 the colors, let's see if it is still
03:48:04.239 visible. So say
03:48:07.160 forest. So the dark theme will almost
03:48:09.920 always work in our themes. So we can go
03:48:12.960 with the ocean as well.
03:48:16.359 Okay. So that was one more component
03:48:18.960 that I wanted to mention and you can put
03:48:20.800 it under the root layout because it'll
03:48:23.359 always be in your entire application. So
03:48:25.840 with this that's going to be it for the
03:48:27.760 entire tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it.
03:48:29.920 We built an entire API as well as the
03:48:32.880 mobile application. We connected them.
03:48:35.199 We even deployed our API. Now that was
03:48:38.160 the URL. I'll copy it. Paste this in.
03:48:41.279 And let's say /
03:48:43.239 API/halth. We should get something like
03:48:45.520 okay. And as you can tell, we don't have
03:48:47.600 any delays at all because we are sending
03:48:50.080 that you know chrome jobs the get
03:48:52.640 methods. If you go under the logs, you
03:48:55.520 should be able to see that like get
03:48:58.000 request sent successfully which is
03:49:00.640 happening every single 14 minutes. Like
03:49:03.439 can you see there's always uh like from
03:49:06.640 here 14 minutes 14 minutes so on and so
03:49:09.520 forth. Every single time there is a
03:49:11.960 14minut chrome job that is set it up
03:49:15.040 thanks to this file that we have. Right?
03:49:18.319 So in every single 14 minute we will
03:49:20.960 send a request so that this doesn't get
03:49:23.439 inactive. So if you think this tutorial
03:49:25.760 was helpful just let me know in the
03:49:27.520 comments and hopefully I'll see you in
03:49:29.600 the next video.

# React Native Habit Tracker Development Guide

## 1. Project Setup
### Initialize Project
```bash
npx create-expo-app
npm run web  # Test initial setup
```

### Folder Structure
```
/lib
  └── appwrite.ts  # Configuration file
/types
  └── database.type.ts  # Type definitions
/src
  └── screens/
      └── components/  # Reusable UI components
```

## 2. UI Development
### Core Screens
1. **Login Page**
   - Email/password inputs
   - Sign-up/Login toggle
   - Form validation

2. **Habit Creation**
```tsx
// Add Habit Screen Components
const HabitForm = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('')
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('')
  const [frequency, setFrequency] = useState('daily')
  const frequencies = ['daily', 'weekly', 'monthly']

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Input Fields */}
      <TextInput value={title} onChangeText={setTitle} />
      <TextInput value={description} onChangeText={setDescription} />
      
      {/* Frequency Selector */}
      {frequencies.map(freq => (
        <Button 
          key={freq}
          onPress={() => setFrequency(freq)}
          mode={frequency === freq ? "contained" : "outlined"}
        >
          {freq}
        </Button>
      ))}
      
      <Button mode="contained" onPress={handleSubmit}>
        Add Habit
      </Button>
    </View>
  )
}
```

3. **Habit Display**
```tsx
// Today's Habits Screen
const HabitCard = ({ habit }) => (
  <Surface style={styles.card}>
    <Text variant="titleMedium">{habit.title}</Text>
    <View style={styles.streakContainer}>
      <MaterialCommunityIcons name="fire" size={24} />
      <Text>{habit.streakCount} day streak</Text>
    </View>
  </Surface>
)
```

## 3. Authentication
### AppWrite Integration
1. Create `.env.local`:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=your_appwrite_endpoint
EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
```

2. Auth Context Setup
```tsx
// lib/auth.context.ts
export const AuthContext = createContext()

export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)

  // Auth functions (signUp, signIn, signOut)
  const signUp = async (email, password) => {
    // Implementation using AppWrite
  }

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, isLoading, signUp }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## 4. Database Implementation
### AppWrite Collections
1. **Habits Collection**
   - Attributes:
     - `userId` (string)
     - `title` (string)
     - `description` (string)
     - `frequency` (string)
     - `streakCount` (integer)

2. **Habit Completions**
   - Attributes:
     - `habitId` (string)
     - `userId` (string)
     - `completedAt` (datetime)

### Type Definitions
```ts
// types/database.type.ts
interface Habit extends Models.Document {
  userId: string
  title: string
  description: string
  frequency: string
  streakCount: number
}

interface HabitCompletion extends Models.Document {
  habitId: string
  userId: string
  completedAt: string
}
```

## 5. CRUD Operations
### Create Habit
```ts
import { ID } from 'react-native-appwrite'
import { databases } from '@/lib/appwrite'

const createHabit = async (userId, title, description, frequency) => {
  try {
    await databases.createDocument(
      process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID,
      'habits',
      ID.unique(),
      {
        userId,
        title,
        description,
        frequency,
        streakCount: 0
      }
    )
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating habit:', error)
  }
}
```

### Fetch Habits
```ts
const fetchHabits = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await databases.listDocuments(
      process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID,
      'habits',
      [Query.equal('userId', userId)]
    )
    return response.documents
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching habits:', error)
  }
}
```

## 6. Realtime Updates
```ts
// Subscribe to habit completions
const setupRealtimeUpdates = () => {
  const subscription = databases.subscribe(
    'collections.habit_completions.documents',
    (response) => {
      if (response.events.includes('documents.create')) {
        fetchHabits()
      }
    }
  )
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
}
```

## 7. Swipe Actions
```tsx
// Swipeable Habit Item
import { Swipeable } from 'react-native-swipe-list-view'

const SwipeableHabit = ({ habit }) => {
  const renderRightActions = () => (
    <View style={styles.swipeActionRight}>
      <MaterialCommunityIcons name="check-circle-outline" size={32} color="#fff" />
    </View>
  )

  return (
    <Swipeable renderRightActions={renderRightActions}>
      <HabitCard habit={habit} />
    </Swipeable>
  )
}
```

## 8. State Management
```ts
// Using React Hooks
const [habits, setHabits] = useState<Habit[]>([])
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)

useEffect(() => {
  const loadHabits = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await fetchHabits(currentUser.$id)
      setHabits(data)
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to load habits')
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false)
    }
  }
  loadHabits()
}, [])
```

## 9. Deployment
1. Configure AppWrite permissions
2. Set up environment variables
3. Test on all platforms:
```bash
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```
```

This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of the habit tracker application as described in the transcript, organized by functional areas with code examples and implementation details.

# React Native Full Course 2025 | Become a React Native Pro in 4 Hours
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/J50gwzwLvAk

00:00:00.160 Welcome to my React Native crash course
00:00:02.800 for 2025. In this video, you're going to
00:00:05.440 go from a complete beginner to knowing
00:00:07.200 how to build a complete full stack habit
00:00:09.440 tracker app from scratch using React
00:00:11.840 Native, Expo, and AppRide. This course
00:00:14.719 is designed for absolute beginners.
00:00:16.960 Whether you are brand new to mobile
00:00:18.640 development or switching over from web,
00:00:20.960 you'll learn how to build beautiful UIs,
00:00:23.279 create different screens, manage state,
00:00:25.680 connect a backend, and create real
00:00:27.920 mobile experiences, all using the most
00:00:30.240 up-to-date and modern tools. We'll go
00:00:32.880 step by step starting from the
00:00:34.480 fundamentals and slowly progressing to a
00:00:36.480 fully featured app with user
00:00:38.280 authentication, real-time habit
00:00:40.160 tracking, and clean responsive design.
00:00:42.640 Now, React Native continues to be one of
00:00:44.640 the most powerful frameworks for
00:00:46.559 building cross-platform apps in 2025.
00:00:49.600 You write code once with React and your
00:00:51.920 app runs on iOS, Android, and even the
00:00:54.640 web, all with native performance. Plus,
00:00:57.600 with tools like Expo, it's never been
00:00:59.760 easier to prototype and ship apps fast.
00:01:02.480 It's trusted by companies like
00:01:04.080 Instagram, Shopify, and Discord, and
00:01:06.560 backed by massive open-source ecosystem.
00:01:09.439 If you are a React developer or just
00:01:11.360 getting started with mobile, React
00:01:13.200 Native is your best next move. So, first
00:01:15.680 things first, how exactly does React
00:01:18.000 Native work? Well, like I said, it
00:01:20.560 allows you to build mobile apps using
00:01:22.479 JavaScript and React, but instead of
00:01:24.159 running in a browser, it runs on a real
00:01:26.479 mobile device. That means that you have
00:01:28.320 access to native features like a camera,
00:01:30.880 GPS, and more. It lets you use a single
00:01:33.840 codebase for both iOS and Android,
00:01:36.000 saving you tons of time and effort in
00:01:38.400 the process. Now, there's a couple core
00:01:40.720 React Native components that I want you
00:01:42.720 guys to just keep in mind before we
00:01:44.560 start the tutorial. We're obviously
00:01:46.240 going to go over them later on, but for
00:01:48.720 now, I just want to present it to you.
00:01:50.720 The first component is a view. And a
00:01:52.880 view in React Native is like a container
00:01:54.960 or a wrapper. Think of it as a div in
00:01:57.680 HTML. It's used to lay out your app and
00:02:00.399 holds other components inside. Views can
00:02:02.880 be styled to control the layout of your
00:02:05.040 UI like controlling width, hide,
00:02:07.439 margins, and paddings. The second
00:02:09.598 component is text and the text component
00:02:12.319 is used to display like the name implies
00:02:14.400 text on your screen. Think of it like
00:02:16.640 the paragraph tag in HTML, but with more
00:02:19.280 customization options for styling fonts,
00:02:21.680 colors, and alignment. The third is a
00:02:24.720 text input. The text input component is
00:02:27.360 used to get text directly from the user.
00:02:30.640 It is like a normal input, but it's way
00:02:32.959 more tailored for the developer
00:02:35.280 experience. It is mainly used for stuff
00:02:37.519 like login forms or a search bar. And
00:02:40.480 the final component is a scroll view.
00:02:42.720 And a scroll view is something that you
00:02:44.319 usually don't see on a web project, but
00:02:46.080 it is a component that allows you to
00:02:47.840 create a scrollable area when the
00:02:49.840 content exceeds the screen size. Now,
00:02:52.239 those are just a couple of the core
00:02:54.160 components we're going to be using, but
00:02:55.680 we're going to be using a lot more as
00:02:57.280 well. And also, in order to create our
00:02:59.519 React Native app, we'll be using a
00:03:01.599 powerful open-source framework that will
00:03:03.760 work on top of React Native called Expo.
00:03:06.800 Expo simplifies the development process
00:03:08.800 and allows you to build mobile apps with
00:03:10.560 React Native without needing to set up
00:03:12.480 complicated native code. It provides a
00:03:14.720 set of tools, libraries, and services
00:03:16.640 that speed up development and make it
00:03:18.720 easier to test and deploy your apps.
00:03:21.040 With Expo, you can instantly preview
00:03:23.200 your app using your phone through an app
00:03:25.920 called the Expo Go app without needing
00:03:27.840 to deal with Xcode or Android Studio.
00:03:30.560 You can also access device features like
00:03:32.799 the camera, GPS, notifications, and so
00:03:35.200 on right out of the box without needing
00:03:36.959 to write native code. You can use a
00:03:39.440 powerful development environment with a
00:03:41.360 fast refresh for you to actually see
00:03:43.360 your changes in a simulator or in your
00:03:45.599 real device. And in short, Expo is
00:03:47.840 perfect for quickly getting started with
00:03:49.519 React Native and building apps that can
00:03:51.120 run on both iOS and Android without
00:03:53.440 having to waste time on setup. We're
00:03:55.440 going to be using Expo for this video.
00:03:57.439 And if you want to check out the code
00:03:58.799 for the video, it's going to be in the
00:04:00.400 description together with an even more
00:04:02.319 advanced version that I didn't include
00:04:04.560 in the video, but could help you guys
00:04:06.400 have an idea of how a large scale React
00:04:09.200 Native app could look like. Also, if you
00:04:11.840 enjoyed the way I teach React, you
00:04:13.920 should check out my new ReactJS course
00:04:16.238 for beginners. It's been almost a month
00:04:18.160 since I released this course and the
00:04:19.600 feedback has been incredible. Also, in
00:04:22.000 the first month, we have early bird
00:04:23.680 pricing. So, if you click in the link in
00:04:25.440 the description and you use the code
00:04:27.040 early 100, you'll get 20% off my course.
00:04:30.160 In this course, you will learn
00:04:31.440 everything related to React.js JS as a
00:04:34.160 beginner and I'll take you all the way
00:04:35.759 to knowing how to build large scale apps
00:04:38.160 through four different big projects. So
00:04:40.800 if you're interested in that, go ahead
00:04:42.080 and click the link in the description
00:04:43.440 and check it out. Now that we got all of
00:04:46.000 this out of the way, let's get into the
00:04:48.160 video. Okay, everyone. Now that we
00:04:49.919 understand some of the main core
00:04:51.680 concepts of React Native, let's start
00:04:54.479 building a React Native application
00:04:57.199 inside of our computer. Now, in order
00:04:59.680 for us to create our app, I have here a
00:05:02.560 folder that I opened up inside of my
00:05:05.120 code editor of choice, which is VS Code.
00:05:07.680 And I want to open up my terminal and
00:05:11.520 run the following command. I want to run
00:05:15.560 npx
00:05:17.080 create expo app. Then I'm going to put a
00:05:21.360 dot which will represent uh the that I
00:05:24.720 want to create this Expo app inside of
00:05:26.960 the current directory that I'm in which
00:05:28.560 is the folder that I created. Now if
00:05:30.880 you've never ran this create a expo app
00:05:33.039 command before, you'll probably be
00:05:35.120 prompted to install the the package just
00:05:38.240 as you can see over here. And this is
00:05:39.919 the version of create a expo app that
00:05:42.479 I'm using. Now, if you don't have the
00:05:44.160 package installed, just press enter and
00:05:45.840 it will install the CLI command and also
00:05:49.199 start setting up your app. When the
00:05:51.520 project is done creating, you should see
00:05:53.840 this uh little message saying that your
00:05:55.680 project is ready and that you can run
00:05:57.440 your project using one of the following
00:05:59.280 commands. Now, like I said before, when
00:06:02.160 you create a project with React Native
00:06:04.319 and specifically with Expo, um you can
00:06:06.960 you're actually creating a project that
00:06:09.199 runs on Android, on iOS, and on the web
00:06:12.400 all natively. So, you can actually see
00:06:14.880 the version of your app running on an
00:06:17.600 Android emulator, an iOS simulator, or
00:06:21.440 uh your actual browser. Now I want to go
00:06:24.639 over briefly how a boilerplate expo
00:06:28.880 project is generated. So uh I want to
00:06:31.759 talk about the different folders and
00:06:33.280 files that come with an React Native
00:06:35.840 Expo app and so you already have an idea
00:06:38.800 because as you can see it already has a
00:06:40.560 bunch of different folders and it might
00:06:42.000 be a little bit overwhelming at first.
00:06:44.080 Now the main thing that you should know
00:06:46.160 is that a React Native app using Expo is
00:06:50.080 very similar to a normal React app.
00:06:52.160 Right? You see we have our package.json
00:06:54.000 to manage our dependencies, our TS
00:06:56.160 config because we're using TypeScript
00:06:58.000 and all of the other folders that you
00:07:00.160 might see in a normal React app. Now the
00:07:02.400 thing is this is not actually a fully
00:07:06.160 like built from scratch project in React
00:07:09.120 Native. When we create when we run the
00:07:10.720 create expo app command, it actually
00:07:13.360 creates a project using the default
00:07:15.360 template. And this template has an
00:07:17.680 essential boilerplate code uh with other
00:07:20.479 libraries that are essential for you to
00:07:22.639 build your app. So, uh a lot of
00:07:24.960 different packages are actually already
00:07:26.639 installed because of this boilerplate um
00:07:29.599 app. But we can actually reset it if we
00:07:31.520 want to. Now, to test out what the
00:07:34.720 boilerplate code is, I'm going to run
00:07:37.199 npm run web. Now, in order for me to
00:07:41.039 show you guys uh what the boilerplate
00:07:43.520 project is, I'm going to choose what uh
00:07:46.880 type of software I want to run my
00:07:48.960 application on. And since we're building
00:07:50.560 an app, I'm going to run on iOS. I
00:07:53.520 already have the uh Xcode simulator uh
00:07:56.960 installed, the iPhone simulator
00:07:58.479 installed into my computer. If you
00:08:00.240 don't, you have to install it. Um but uh
00:08:03.520 if you want to just run it on web, you
00:08:05.280 can do that as well. So, I'm going to
00:08:07.039 run npm run iOS. And you'll see that it
00:08:10.560 will start a project using um iOS. But
00:08:13.680 it, as you can see, if you don't have
00:08:15.440 the iOS simulator installed, it will
00:08:18.319 actually give you um an option for you
00:08:21.120 to install uh the different developer
00:08:24.160 tools that you need. So, I'm going to
00:08:25.759 run going to put yes over here. It's
00:08:27.840 going to open up um Xcode. And as you
00:08:30.800 can see, even though I do have Axcode,
00:08:34.399 uh it's just on an older version in this
00:08:36.479 computer I'm using to record this video.
00:08:38.719 We have to install the iOS component for
00:08:42.479 uh in its latest version and it is 8.86
00:08:45.760 GB. So, I just click here, download and
00:08:48.080 install, and it will start installing
00:08:50.000 the system component for the iOS
00:08:52.240 simulator. It shouldn't take that long.
00:08:53.839 I uninstalled it into this computer so
00:08:56.080 you guys can get an idea of how to
00:08:58.080 actually set it up. But if you're using
00:09:00.160 Windows, you can and you have Android
00:09:02.399 Studio and you want to run an Android
00:09:05.920 app, you can use the Android Studio
00:09:08.240 emulator as well. If you want to build
00:09:10.080 it for both types of mobile phones, but
00:09:13.440 you don't want to use the emulators, I
00:09:15.200 would recommend just running it on web
00:09:16.959 and um you'll get the experience um on
00:09:19.760 running those emulators later on. So,
00:09:21.680 I'm going to wait for this to reinstall
00:09:23.279 the iOS 18.4 simulator and I'll be back
00:09:26.399 when it's done. Now I have successfully
00:09:28.480 installed the simulator. So I can just
00:09:30.560 run again npm run iOS and you might run
00:09:33.519 into this issue where it gives you the
00:09:36.080 same uh text saying that you need to
00:09:38.959 actually install. But you see that if
00:09:41.200 this message is still occurring after
00:09:42.959 installing Xcode, you might need to
00:09:45.200 finish the installation by running this
00:09:47.200 command. So you copy this command over
00:09:49.360 here and you close out the terminal. You
00:09:53.040 run it. It will ask for your computer
00:09:55.200 password. You just run your computer
00:09:57.200 password and um now if we run npm run
00:10:00.880 iOS again, it should actually run our
00:10:04.000 iOS simulator. It's running on iPhone 16
00:10:07.440 Pro. I can actually it will open for me
00:10:10.560 as you can see over here on the right. I
00:10:13.360 have my um simulator opened up. All I
00:10:16.320 did was I just searched for the
00:10:17.440 simulator app that I just installed on
00:10:19.839 my MacBook computer. And as you can see,
00:10:22.320 it has installed the Axo app. Not only
00:10:25.839 that, but it also has the name of your
00:10:27.760 app, which is the name of the folder.
00:10:29.920 Now, if I click uh close over here, this
00:10:33.360 is our app. We have our app successfully
00:10:35.440 running. Now, you see that this is the
00:10:37.760 boilerplate app which comes with all of
00:10:39.920 the folders that I mentioned. But like I
00:10:42.079 said, this is actually just a template
00:10:44.720 and you can build up off of this.
00:10:47.120 However, since I'm teaching you guys
00:10:48.959 React Native from scratch, we don't want
00:10:50.959 to actually build our project and learn
00:10:53.120 using this template. We want to reset
00:10:55.279 the project such that it is at a clean
00:10:57.680 slate. And to do that, we have this very
00:10:59.920 nifty command which we can run on a new
00:11:02.399 terminal called npm run
00:11:06.040 reset project. And when we run this, it
00:11:09.040 is going to ask if we want to delete all
00:11:12.160 of the files or move them into another
00:11:14.640 one. I'm going to put no actually
00:11:16.560 because then it will actually delete all
00:11:18.399 of the uh parts of the project that were
00:11:21.360 part of that template. So you see here
00:11:23.920 it deleted a bunch of files and it
00:11:26.959 generated some of the files that are
00:11:28.880 necessary for a project to run such as
00:11:31.440 the app folder and the the other two
00:11:34.240 files here that I'll mention in a
00:11:35.680 second. Um and we have a new project
00:11:37.680 from scratch. So we can actually get
00:11:40.000 started. So let's get started with this
00:11:42.800 app folder which is the most important
00:11:44.640 part of your project. So let's start
00:11:46.399 with the folder. What what is this
00:11:48.240 folder? Well, the app folder is similar
00:11:50.320 to like the app folder uh in other
00:11:53.680 frameworks like Nex.js. It is actually
00:11:56.399 where all of your routes, meaning all
00:11:58.560 the pages slashcreens that you have in
00:12:00.959 your app are going to live. Now, we're
00:12:03.440 going to talk about navigation and
00:12:05.200 creating routes. But the way you define
00:12:08.320 navigation, different pages in your in
00:12:10.240 your app is through a file-based system.
00:12:12.480 So, we're going to be creating files and
00:12:13.839 folders inside of here to determine the
00:12:16.079 different screens we have on our app.
00:12:18.240 Now each file that you put inside of
00:12:20.880 this app will automatically become
00:12:23.440 screen. However, there are two super
00:12:26.079 important files that are here by default
00:12:28.399 and you need to understand what they
00:12:29.920 are. So the first one is the
00:12:33.000 index.tsx. This is the index route. Now
00:12:36.399 this file is the entry point of our app
00:12:38.560 and it will execute when the development
00:12:41.200 server starts. By default, we see here
00:12:43.519 that it uses some of the core React
00:12:46.639 Native components that we've mentioned.
00:12:48.639 So, like I mentioned in the beginning of
00:12:50.639 the video, a view is more thought of
00:12:53.760 like a div in a normal web project and a
00:12:57.600 text is more thought of as a paragraph
00:13:00.399 tag or an H1 tag. Now, this index uh
00:13:03.920 screen over here is the main screen that
00:13:06.399 you have in your project, but you can
00:13:08.240 create other ones as well. Now all of
00:13:10.720 those screens are defined by the Expo
00:13:13.600 router framework. Now there are a couple
00:13:16.240 things that you need to understand about
00:13:17.519 navigation and routing in React Native
00:13:20.000 and Expo. So like I said, this is a
00:13:22.560 file-based routing and that means that
00:13:25.200 in this app directory over here, we have
00:13:27.440 to define folders and files to determine
00:13:30.240 the different routes and screens we're
00:13:31.839 going to have. Now all of them are
00:13:33.839 binded together by this layout file over
00:13:36.480 here. This root layout is actually the
00:13:41.200 shared is actually where we define
00:13:44.240 shared UI elements between in between
00:13:46.959 all of the different routes. So this
00:13:49.360 means that for example in your app if
00:13:51.200 you have UI elements that you might want
00:13:53.200 to have on every single screen like
00:13:55.040 maybe a header different tabs you know
00:13:57.360 to navigate between them uh things that
00:13:59.440 should stay consistent in between all
00:14:01.120 the different routes you would put them
00:14:02.959 over here. Now, this stack over here
00:14:05.680 represents whichever screen you're in.
00:14:08.160 So, if you have worked with React in the
00:14:10.480 past and you've worked with something
00:14:11.680 like React Router DOM or something like
00:14:14.720 Nex.js uh filebased routing as well, you
00:14:17.920 might know what I'm talking about. This
00:14:19.360 is what this depending on what screen
00:14:21.760 we're in, the screen UI will be rendered
00:14:24.480 over here and whatever we put around it
00:14:27.279 will actually be uh displayed as well.
00:14:30.079 So I could put here a text that will say
00:14:33.040 hello. And if I import text from uh
00:14:39.040 actually from React
00:14:40.760 Native, you should see that hello should
00:14:43.199 show up no matter what. Now the thing is
00:14:46.160 uh hello is showing up over here, but
00:14:48.000 it's showing up right at the top here. I
00:14:50.480 don't know if you can even see it.
00:14:52.079 Probably not. Maybe if I just like copy
00:14:54.320 and paste this like a bunch of times,
00:14:56.000 you might see it. Uh but it is appearing
00:14:58.240 above the stack. And if I put this below
00:15:00.160 here as well, you'll see that it will
00:15:01.920 appear below. Whatever is in between
00:15:04.480 both of them is the screen that we're in
00:15:06.720 and it's being represented by this
00:15:08.880 stack. Now, how do we create a different
00:15:11.360 route or different um screen in our
00:15:14.240 application? So, the way we're going to
00:15:15.839 do this is we're going to come here to
00:15:18.480 our app folder and we're going to create
00:15:22.959 a new navigation item. So to add a new
00:15:25.839 screen to this stack, I could come here
00:15:27.680 to our um app folder and I can just
00:15:30.639 create a new file. Now the name of the
00:15:33.360 file is what is going to determine what
00:15:35.360 the name of the screen is. So for
00:15:37.160 example, if I want to make an login
00:15:41.120 screen, I could just make a
00:15:44.680 login.tsx. And for example, if I want to
00:15:47.360 make a log login login screen, I can
00:15:49.199 just make a
00:15:50.839 login.tsx. And now I can export a
00:15:54.959 component from inside this file. So I'm
00:15:58.320 going to export
00:15:59.959 default function. I can give it whatever
00:16:03.279 name I want. But usually what I like for
00:16:05.680 naming convention is I name the name of
00:16:08.000 the screen. So login and then I put
00:16:11.240 screen. And then inside of here we need
00:16:13.839 to return some sort of UI. We're going
00:16:16.320 to return a
00:16:18.600 view with some sort of I don't know text
00:16:21.839 inside of it. We can put whatever UI we
00:16:24.079 want. Now I'm going to import this UI
00:16:27.120 over here. So I'm going to import view
00:16:29.600 and
00:16:30.759 text from React
00:16:33.720 Native. And I'm going to put hello. This
00:16:37.120 is the login page. Now when I save this,
00:16:41.199 absolutely nothing happens. we still see
00:16:43.680 our um index.ts, right? The this screen
00:16:47.680 over here, it it it's whatever I put in
00:16:50.079 here, you'll see it will update to this.
00:16:51.920 However, we don't see the login page
00:16:53.920 that we just created. And the reason for
00:16:55.759 that is because in our root layout over
00:16:57.759 here, we never actually defined that
00:17:00.320 screen. So, what we want to do is we
00:17:02.720 actually want to um keep this stack
00:17:05.679 component, but we want to actually um
00:17:08.959 like not self-close it. And inside of
00:17:10.799 here, we're going to define each
00:17:13.039 individual stack screen. So this is how
00:17:15.839 you define a screen. You just say stack
00:17:18.160 screen. You need to give it a name. So
00:17:19.760 we have here the obviously the index
00:17:22.400 screen that we can create that this it
00:17:24.480 already existed, but now we're just
00:17:26.000 formalizing it. And we can pass some
00:17:28.000 options. for example. Uh and different
00:17:30.080 options that you can pass to a screen is
00:17:33.440 for example a name which is the required
00:17:36.960 uh prop that you need to pass and a
00:17:38.960 bunch of other optional ones as well.
00:17:41.360 Now they're not important for now but
00:17:43.600 you might need to use them in the
00:17:45.120 future. The important one is just
00:17:46.559 knowing that you need to pass a title
00:17:48.080 for each individual screen. Now the home
00:17:50.320 screen is going to be called home. And
00:17:52.799 you see that immediately this changes to
00:17:54.559 home when before uh it didn't even
00:17:57.360 compile. But if I put something else
00:17:58.880 over here, now it changes at the top. So
00:18:01.440 this is what the purpose of the title
00:18:03.280 is. Now we can define another screen
00:18:06.320 over here. And this other screen is not
00:18:08.400 going to be the index. It's going to be
00:18:10.320 the login screen. And we can give it a
00:18:13.679 different name like login as well. And
00:18:16.240 we now know that it exists. But again,
00:18:20.160 how do I get to that screen? Well, to
00:18:23.039 get to that screen, we need to find a
00:18:24.720 way to navigate to it. And since our
00:18:27.120 project starts from the index route, we
00:18:29.760 need a way to do that through the index
00:18:31.679 route. Now, in order to navigate between
00:18:34.640 screens, there's a couple ways. Now, the
00:18:37.440 most web ccentric way that you can
00:18:39.600 imagine is by using a link. And there is
00:18:41.760 actually a link component that you can
00:18:44.160 use from um Expo Router. Now, this link
00:18:51.360 component is pretty simple. It's like
00:18:53.200 any link component you might use in a in
00:18:55.520 a normal web react library. You just
00:18:58.640 call the link. You put um some sort of
00:19:01.120 text like login page and then you have
00:19:05.039 to pass here an href. So the href is
00:19:08.160 just the route to your screen. And you
00:19:11.919 see that immediately it already offers
00:19:14.000 us different options that we might want
00:19:15.919 to use that are existing in our project.
00:19:18.720 Specifically the login one that we want.
00:19:21.200 So, we can create this over here. And
00:19:23.679 you should see that now we have this
00:19:25.280 login page text, but it doesn't really
00:19:28.000 look like a link or a button, right? So,
00:19:31.120 I'm going to show you guys in a second
00:19:32.640 how to actually make this look a little
00:19:34.559 bit better by applying some styling. But
00:19:36.640 for now, we know that if we click on
00:19:38.640 this, we are actually navigating to the
00:19:41.600 login screen. And we see the UI that we
00:19:44.240 created in this login screen. We also
00:19:46.880 have by default easy backtracking
00:19:49.919 navigation that is implemented for us
00:19:52.799 without anything to worry about. So we
00:19:54.640 can you can see how we can actually move
00:19:56.640 between different parts of the app
00:19:58.960 without having to worry. Now how do I
00:20:01.039 apply some styling to make this link
00:20:03.120 look a little bit better? Well, you
00:20:05.280 could apply similar to what we've
00:20:06.880 mentioned here, right? There's a style
00:20:08.720 thing over here that you can use. I
00:20:10.559 could come over here and just say style
00:20:13.120 and apply some inline styling. I can
00:20:15.600 make this for example uh be a button. So
00:20:19.840 I can set the width to be I don't know
00:20:23.440 something like 200 and then the height
00:20:26.559 to be let's make it like 50. It's going
00:20:30.400 to look kind of weird. I can set a
00:20:32.000 background color to be uh coral. Uh
00:20:37.039 actually this has to be a string. And
00:20:39.200 then it will look like this.
00:20:41.600 Uh, I'll put some border radius and I'll
00:20:45.120 say it's like eight. Then I can also
00:20:48.400 text align
00:20:50.360 to center. And I could also just make
00:20:54.840 this width and height actually smaller,
00:20:58.520 like way smaller. Something like this.
00:21:01.120 Right? So obviously it doesn't look
00:21:02.799 amazing, but I'm just showing you guys
00:21:04.240 that this is how you would apply styling
00:21:05.919 to this. and um it will look a little
00:21:08.480 bit more like what the UI element should
00:21:10.799 look like. Now there's a different way
00:21:12.240 for you to actually apply styling. You
00:21:13.919 see that here we have styles for our
00:21:15.919 view and for our link. Now obviously you
00:21:19.679 could apply the styling through inline
00:21:21.039 styling like this. However, sometimes
00:21:23.120 you might want to keep it all condensed
00:21:24.880 in one place. So you can actually use
00:21:26.960 the stylesheet um object that exists
00:21:30.400 from React Native, not Expo Router.
00:21:32.960 Sorry about that. Stylesheet. And what
00:21:35.919 this does is somewhere in your app,
00:21:39.360 usually at the bottom, you can define a
00:21:41.679 styles object and you use the stylesheet
00:21:45.440 to create your screens stylesheet, which
00:21:50.000 means you can define all the styles for
00:21:52.480 your screen inside of this object. For
00:21:55.240 example, let's grab this view over here,
00:21:57.919 right? Uh this is the view. So for the
00:22:01.600 homepage so I can say uh view as the
00:22:07.039 like the style that we are styling and I
00:22:09.760 can just copy all of these styles and
00:22:13.360 just paste them over here and then if I
00:22:16.559 come to this style object over here
00:22:18.960 instead of directly inserting the styles
00:22:21.600 I can just say styles do and it will
00:22:25.280 actually use the styles from that view.
00:22:27.760 Now I can do the exact same thing here
00:22:29.760 with the
00:22:31.640 uh navigation button. I can create a nav
00:22:35.840 button over here and paste that. And
00:22:38.559 then I can just call this
00:22:41.080 styles.nav button. So this is how you
00:22:44.720 would apply some basic styling inside of
00:22:47.039 your project. Now you might be asking
00:22:50.960 yourself, okay, but when I use an app
00:22:53.679 there, it doesn't look like this.
00:22:55.679 There's no buttons to navigate. That
00:22:57.679 doesn't look like a real app. Real apps
00:23:00.400 actually have some sort of navigation um
00:23:03.440 tabs like a like some some way for you
00:23:05.760 to keep clicking. Usually at the bottom,
00:23:07.520 right, where you you click between the
00:23:09.200 different tabs in your app, you can
00:23:10.720 navigate. If you think about like
00:23:11.840 Instagram, Tik Tok, or any other um app
00:23:14.480 that you use, they all have those little
00:23:16.320 tabs at the bottom, and you can actually
00:23:17.760 navigate between the screens using that.
00:23:20.080 So, how do we do that? Well, that
00:23:22.240 concept is called tabs. And it's
00:23:24.240 actually really simple for you to
00:23:25.440 implement in React Native. The way we're
00:23:27.440 going to do that is we're actually going
00:23:28.720 to get um the different screens that we
00:23:31.120 have, which for now is the login and the
00:23:33.120 index. And we're going to create a new
00:23:34.960 folder. Now, this folder is going to be
00:23:37.280 called the tabs folder. And we have to
00:23:41.360 use this little parentheses over here.
00:23:44.559 This tab folder is a special folder
00:23:47.200 because we can put different uh screens
00:23:50.240 inside of it and group them together.
00:23:52.400 just put the navigation to them at the
00:23:54.320 bottom of the screen as if we have some
00:23:56.480 sort of like bottom uh tab navigator.
00:23:59.760 So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
00:24:01.120 copy the index and the login and I'm
00:24:03.360 just going to put them inside of the
00:24:04.880 tabs folder. Just going to move them.
00:24:06.960 And now that we have a collection of
00:24:08.960 screens, which is why we use this um
00:24:11.679 parentheses over here, which is a way
00:24:13.760 for us to indicate that this is a route
00:24:16.640 group, we actually have to set up a
00:24:19.120 layout for this group of routes. So I'm
00:24:22.240 going to copy this layout file and I'm
00:24:23.919 going to paste it on the tabs folder
00:24:25.760 over here. Now this means that we have
00:24:27.760 to define what are the screens that
00:24:30.000 exist in this group. So the screens that
00:24:33.840 exist on this group are the screens that
00:24:35.760 we already created before. We are
00:24:38.480 basically merging them into one group of
00:24:41.840 of screens that will exist in our app.
00:24:45.520 Now we're going to call that group of
00:24:47.440 screens the tabs. Right? It's the name
00:24:50.159 of the folder that we created over here.
00:24:52.720 So on the layout inside of the tabs
00:24:55.919 folder, we can just leave it like this.
00:24:58.480 Uh we can actually change the name
00:25:00.159 instead of root layout. This is the tabs
00:25:02.480 layout like this. But the layout folder
00:25:06.720 which is has the root layout can be
00:25:09.360 changed to instead of showing the two
00:25:11.679 individual screens, it will actually
00:25:13.520 just show the or render the tab group.
00:25:17.520 So in here we're going to change this to
00:25:21.039 have a name of tabs which will match the
00:25:24.480 name of the folder we created over here.
00:25:26.640 Then you see that immediately the name
00:25:28.720 of the the title of the page over here
00:25:30.400 has changed. And the reason for that is
00:25:32.799 because it doesn't make sense to have a
00:25:34.320 title for a group of screens. Right? So
00:25:38.320 actually in a group of screens we don't
00:25:40.559 want to show the header for this
00:25:43.200 specific stack screen. So I'm going to
00:25:45.679 remove the title over here and I'm going
00:25:47.279 to set a property called header shown to
00:25:51.120 false. And now we are ready to make our
00:25:53.440 bottom tab navigator. So how do we do
00:25:56.240 that? Well, let's think about it. We
00:25:58.000 want this piece of UI to appear on all
00:26:00.960 of the routes that exist on the tabs
00:26:04.480 folder, right? So since this navigator
00:26:06.960 is going to navigate between the
00:26:08.320 different screens on the tabs folder, I
00:26:10.480 want that piece of UI with the buttons
00:26:12.799 to navigate to appear regardless of
00:26:15.120 which of the screens we are in. So that
00:26:17.039 concept relates to the concept of what a
00:26:19.279 layout does. So in this layout file over
00:26:21.440 here, we can put UI that exist in
00:26:24.799 between the uh two screen definitions
00:26:28.880 and it will appear no matter what. Now
00:26:31.279 the most basic way for us to achieve
00:26:33.679 that tab navigation look is actually we
00:26:36.400 don't want to actually call this a stack
00:26:38.559 because this isn't a stack. This is what
00:26:41.360 a stack would be. This is a tab, right?
00:26:44.720 So we want to switch this from instead
00:26:46.799 of saying stack, we actually want to
00:26:48.640 import from expo router the tabs
00:26:52.000 component and we want to render that
00:26:53.720 instead. Now we'll replace this to
00:26:56.080 tabs.screen as well. And you'll see that
00:26:57.919 when I save the file, automatically
00:26:59.840 we're going to get the bottom tab
00:27:01.840 navigator look. So we have here the two
00:27:04.559 different routes and we can actually
00:27:05.840 navigate in between them by just
00:27:07.520 clicking each individual tab. So now we
00:27:10.720 don't need this login page thing. It
00:27:12.960 looks kind of ugly. We can actually
00:27:14.640 remove this from uh from here. Great.
00:27:19.600 Now we have a way for us to navigate.
00:27:22.799 But it's kind of weird. We don't have
00:27:24.880 like for example we have the same icon
00:27:26.799 for each of them. So how can we switch
00:27:28.480 and customize each individual tab? So
00:27:31.039 the way for you to do this is in your
00:27:34.320 layout for the tabs you can actually put
00:27:36.640 some options for the tabs that you
00:27:39.520 create. So the first thing that you can
00:27:41.039 do is you can actually set a color to
00:27:44.640 which tab is active. So for example we
00:27:47.360 are in the home tab over here. I might
00:27:49.200 want to make this tab have a different
00:27:51.760 color. So to do that I can come to the
00:27:53.840 tabs um component over here. I can set a
00:27:56.960 screen options object and I can set a
00:28:01.320 tab bar
00:28:04.840 active tint color and I can set this to
00:28:09.600 be coral for example which is the color
00:28:12.240 I used for that button and now it
00:28:13.760 changed the color of which u tab is
00:28:16.960 active. I could also change this to
00:28:19.120 instead be tabbar active background
00:28:22.399 color and then it just becomes something
00:28:24.000 a little bit more uh insane. I'll just
00:28:27.520 keep it as it was before cuz it looks
00:28:29.039 kind of okay. Now, one thing that we
00:28:31.679 want to do as well maybe is actually
00:28:34.000 changing the icon. So, when you set up
00:28:36.080 your project, it comes with this popular
00:28:38.960 library called the vector icons library
00:28:41.840 from Expo. So this is going to give you
00:28:44.000 a lot of icons and in every app that you
00:28:47.520 create you need to have an icon library
00:28:49.919 just because of how common they are in
00:28:52.559 mobile apps. So the way you import icons
00:28:55.120 depend on which icons you're going to
00:28:57.039 import. So we're going to open up over
00:28:59.360 here the list of icons from ver vector
00:29:02.640 icons and I'll put the link for this
00:29:04.480 together with the uh code for this
00:29:06.880 video. But you can see that there is a
00:29:09.039 list full of icons and there are
00:29:11.200 different icon uh providers right
00:29:13.919 there's as you can see end design if I
00:29:16.320 just search for the home icon we can get
00:29:18.320 one from antipo feather font awesome uh
00:29:22.159 a bunch of them so uh you choose
00:29:24.399 whichever one you want for example let's
00:29:26.399 get this one from um home you can see
00:29:29.440 that the way we do this is uh you copy
00:29:33.039 this command over here to import it you
00:29:35.840 paste it at the top and then you can
00:29:38.000 copy the rendering of that component by
00:29:40.799 just copying that and then just pasting
00:29:42.559 it over here. So if I go back into our
00:29:45.919 app, you see that um actually it won't
00:29:48.640 show up cuz it's it's up here. But you
00:29:51.440 have to trust that it's working. Now
00:29:53.200 what we want to do is we want to put
00:29:54.799 this icon uh to replace the home icon
00:29:57.600 over here. Now, the way we're going to
00:29:59.120 do that is I'm actually going to come to
00:30:01.200 the home tab screen and I want to give
00:30:03.279 it a property called tab bar icon and
00:30:08.240 I'll just set it equal to
00:30:11.399 a function that will have a that will
00:30:14.640 return back this um component call. And
00:30:18.000 you can see that now it renders the home
00:30:20.640 icon instead of the uh whatever that
00:30:24.159 icon was before. Now the problem is that
00:30:26.799 this com this this home icon is rendered
00:30:29.919 as being full no matter what. It's not
00:30:32.080 even following the the color scheme uh
00:30:35.039 that we set at the top over here. So how
00:30:37.840 do we adapt to that? Well, with this tab
00:30:40.960 bar icon function, it actually gives us
00:30:43.600 some arguments that we can use in this
00:30:46.720 um function argument over here. So I'm
00:30:49.120 going to actually dstructure what we can
00:30:51.039 get from this. And what we can get is we
00:30:52.880 can get for example the color. That
00:30:54.640 makes it easy. We can just set now the
00:30:56.799 color of this icon to be the color of
00:30:59.840 our tab. And automatically you see that
00:31:02.080 it now adapts to that color. Right? Now
00:31:05.760 one thing you can do as well is there
00:31:08.399 are different types of icons. Right? So
00:31:11.120 you see we have this uh home icon from
00:31:14.320 foot from font awesome 5. But if I go
00:31:17.520 over here and I search for home
00:31:21.320 um let me see home and then we get
00:31:26.520 probably this was from font awesome 5.
00:31:29.600 We could maybe get this one because it's
00:31:31.760 kind of empty. I'm just it's like an
00:31:33.679 outline instead of being a full one. We
00:31:36.480 can copy that icon. We'll import it over
00:31:38.960 here at the top cuz this one is end
00:31:40.399 design. We'll copy the component name.
00:31:43.039 And what we can do is we can actually
00:31:45.039 render one icon when the tab is focused
00:31:48.799 and render a completely different one
00:31:50.720 when the the tab is not focused. And the
00:31:53.840 way we do this is through the focus
00:31:55.840 property over here on the the argument.
00:31:59.120 So what we do is we ask okay
00:32:01.480 if the uh tab is
00:32:06.200 focused so if focused is true then we
00:32:10.320 want to render this icon but if it's not
00:32:14.799 then we want to render this one. Now
00:32:16.720 this is breaking because actually this
00:32:18.320 is returning back um directly a
00:32:21.440 component. So what we have to do is we
00:32:24.159 have to remove the parenthesis that we
00:32:27.279 were putting and we have to return this
00:32:31.039 result. So I'm going to return whatever
00:32:33.120 is returned from this. So I'm returning
00:32:35.120 if focused is true I return this icon.
00:32:37.919 If focus is false I return this one. And
00:32:40.080 now what this does is you see when when
00:32:42.080 when we are focused on the home we see
00:32:44.480 the font awesome 5 icon. But when I
00:32:46.559 click on this it now switches to the
00:32:48.799 other icon. Now I don't think that this
00:32:50.559 specifically two icons are good for this
00:32:53.279 example just cuz they are actually from
00:32:55.120 different libraries but some libraries
00:32:57.120 do provide um actually like an a filled
00:33:00.559 version and an outline version of each
00:33:02.640 icon. So you can actually do something
00:33:04.159 like this. So this is the basics of um
00:33:07.840 expo routing and the basics of actually
00:33:10.720 react native as a whole. So we will
00:33:14.080 learn the rest through building the
00:33:16.399 project for this course. It's going to
00:33:17.919 be a habit tracking app and it's going
00:33:20.159 to be a full stack app. We're going to
00:33:21.919 learn how to organize our project in a
00:33:23.840 way such that it will make it efficient
00:33:25.760 for us to scale this if we wanted to and
00:33:28.559 you guys will be able to use the
00:33:30.559 knowledge you guys have of React, the
00:33:32.159 basic knowledge of React in order to
00:33:34.480 actually build the rest. I feel like if
00:33:36.480 you understand React a little bit, this
00:33:38.480 is going to be very easy for you. But
00:33:40.640 even if you don't understand React, I'll
00:33:42.399 take you guys every single step of the
00:33:44.559 way so you guys actually get out of this
00:33:46.720 video understanding everything. So,
00:33:49.120 let's get started with building the
00:33:51.039 project. So, as you've seen in the
00:33:52.799 beginning of the video, this project
00:33:54.720 that we're going to be building is going
00:33:56.080 to be a habit tracker, and it's going to
00:33:59.120 be a full stack project. So, we're going
00:34:01.200 to have to learn how to deal with that.
00:34:03.200 But, we're going to continue off from
00:34:04.880 where we left off in the same project,
00:34:06.640 in the same folder that we were coding
00:34:09.280 in. and we want to make some changes. So
00:34:12.320 the first thing I want to do is I want
00:34:14.560 to set up our project such that a user
00:34:17.599 can go into the app and be able to
00:34:20.399 create an account or sign in to an
00:34:22.480 account that they already have. So to do
00:34:25.040 that we're going to have to make our
00:34:26.639 project into a full stack project. And
00:34:29.679 um there's different ways in which you
00:34:31.359 can do that. Uh obviously you can make
00:34:33.199 your own backend or you can use a
00:34:35.040 backend as a service uh provider. Uh
00:34:37.440 there's a bunch of them out there. The
00:34:39.199 most popular examples are Firebase,
00:34:42.000 AppRight, or Superbase. So, in this
00:34:44.560 video, we're going to be using AppRight.
00:34:46.879 So, it is a free service that I'm not
00:34:48.960 sponsored by, but you can just go ahead
00:34:50.960 and click the link in the description or
00:34:52.639 just go to apprite.com. And you will be
00:34:55.040 prompted with this page. It's actually
00:34:57.960 apprite.io. Now, you have to create an
00:35:00.400 account. Uh, I usually just create my
00:35:02.240 account with GitHub. And then, you need
00:35:03.760 to click on go to console. When you
00:35:05.680 click on go to console, you'll be
00:35:07.119 prompted with your projects. I created
00:35:09.200 here a new account uh just for this
00:35:11.920 video. Uh so if you want to create a new
00:35:15.040 project, you click on create a new
00:35:17.119 project over here and it will ask for
00:35:19.440 your project name. So we're going to be
00:35:21.119 making an habit tracker app. So that's
00:35:25.040 what I'm going to be calling it. Now I'm
00:35:27.359 going to click next. And it's going to
00:35:29.440 ask for our region for deployment. Now,
00:35:32.880 right now, AppRight only has Frankfurt.
00:35:35.119 However, they are in the plans of
00:35:37.599 actually adding other regions as well,
00:35:40.079 and it shouldn't be that much of an
00:35:41.599 issue for us in our project. So, we're
00:35:43.760 going to click here on create, and you
00:35:46.160 can see that our project was created.
00:35:48.640 Now, the whole point of using AppRight
00:35:50.400 is that we can facilitate creating a
00:35:52.880 backend for our project. And similar to
00:35:55.119 stuff like Firebase and Superbase,
00:35:56.640 AppRight actually allows you to set up
00:35:59.359 database interactions um authentication
00:36:02.079 into your projects and even real time
00:36:04.480 messaging. So in our case, uh we're
00:36:07.920 going to be using O for handling signing
00:36:11.359 in and um creating accounts and also
00:36:15.119 their database. Now the database on
00:36:17.280 AppRight is actually a relational
00:36:19.839 database. So um if you don't know uh
00:36:22.800 apprite uses Maria DB on its uh
00:36:26.560 underlining uh database however a lot of
00:36:29.520 people think it's actually a nosql
00:36:31.440 database because of the terminology that
00:36:33.760 we use when we are creating our
00:36:35.839 databases on apprite it's very similar
00:36:37.599 to something like on firebase with fire
00:36:39.599 store uh there's words like collections
00:36:42.160 and documents which are very commonly
00:36:44.960 used for nosql databases but actually
00:36:47.839 when you're working with apprite you're
00:36:49.520 working with a relational database. I
00:36:51.520 just wanted to get that out of the way
00:36:52.880 in case you ever had that doubt. Now,
00:36:55.920 we're going to start off. We're not
00:36:57.040 going to create our database yet. We're
00:36:58.720 going to start with our O. And O is
00:37:00.640 already set up by default. However, we
00:37:03.280 have to connect um our AppRite project
00:37:06.400 to our React Native application. So what
00:37:09.920 I want to do is I want to go back to our
00:37:12.320 app and I want to create a folder that
00:37:15.200 is going to be outside of our app folder
00:37:17.760 and it's going to be called the lip. Now
00:37:19.920 in here we're going to create the
00:37:22.040 appite.ts file which is going to be the
00:37:24.960 configuration file for connecting
00:37:26.640 apprite to our project. So what we need
00:37:29.760 to do is we need to install the react
00:37:32.480 native app SDK. So I'm going to come
00:37:35.119 over here and we're going to clear out
00:37:37.920 our terminal and I'm going to run
00:37:40.520 npx expo install. So when you install
00:37:44.000 packages you run npx expo install and
00:37:46.880 then you put the name of the package
00:37:48.160 which in our case is going to be react
00:37:51.320 native
00:37:52.839 apprite. Now we also want to install
00:37:55.440 another library that is going to help
00:37:57.440 establish this connection. is going to
00:37:59.359 be the React Native URL
00:38:03.960 polyfill and we'll press enter. This
00:38:07.040 should install both packages into our
00:38:09.200 project. And at the top over here of our
00:38:11.599 app file, I'm going to import uh the
00:38:15.480 account, the
00:38:18.359 client, and the
00:38:20.680 databases from
00:38:23.560 React
00:38:25.880 Native Appite.
00:38:28.640 Uh then below this we're going to create
00:38:31.760 our apprite client. So I'm going to say
00:38:34.400 conclient is equal to new client. Now we
00:38:38.240 have to put a couple things um into this
00:38:40.960 client in order for it to actually
00:38:42.720 connect to our project. The first thing
00:38:44.560 we need to do is we need to set an
00:38:46.440 endpoint. Now an endpoint is going to be
00:38:48.960 an endpoint that we get from appite. So
00:38:51.599 if I go over here, I can go to settings
00:38:54.000 and I can see that my API endpoint is
00:38:56.720 this over here on the overview. We get
00:38:58.480 the API credentials and we can copy this
00:39:01.280 value. Then we can put it directly over
00:39:03.760 here and uh it will actually set that
00:39:06.800 endpoint. Now the second thing I have to
00:39:08.560 do is I have to set the project to
00:39:11.920 specify what project I am creating on in
00:39:15.119 my account. Now the project is going to
00:39:17.760 be this ID over here. So I'm going to
00:39:20.160 copy this and I'm going to go back over
00:39:22.640 here and I'll just set the project equal
00:39:24.800 to this. Now the final thing is I need
00:39:27.839 to set the platform for my project. Now
00:39:30.240 I haven't actually set up my project
00:39:32.480 yet. To do that I'm going to go here to
00:39:34.560 overview and we need to add a platform
00:39:37.040 such that so that we specify where we
00:39:39.599 are building our app right project. So
00:39:42.000 there's web, there's flutter, there's
00:39:44.040 apple specific and there's obviously
00:39:46.720 react native. So, I'm going to copy
00:39:48.079 here, click here on React Native, and uh
00:39:50.640 it's going to ask us for a package name
00:39:52.560 registration. We're just going to give
00:39:54.240 it a name for the app. So, I'm going to
00:39:56.320 call it the habit tracker app. Uh then
00:40:00.720 it's going to ask for a package name.
00:40:02.560 You can call it whatever you want. I'm
00:40:04.079 going to call it co.pro
00:40:07.960 tag.habit tracker or something like
00:40:10.400 this. You can see that you can set the
00:40:12.480 value for both iOS and Android. I'll
00:40:15.440 just keep both of them the same. And
00:40:16.800 then I'm going to click on next. Now
00:40:19.280 when I click next, it's going to
00:40:20.800 actually give the commands that we
00:40:23.200 already installed. So I'm going to click
00:40:24.560 next again. And everything that we
00:40:26.400 already wrote is actually already over
00:40:28.320 here. So I'll just actually copy this
00:40:30.400 and I'll go back to our code and I'll
00:40:33.040 just paste it so that we get the
00:40:34.720 platform as well. Now I'm going to click
00:40:37.040 on go to dashboard and we should have
00:40:39.520 correctly connected our project. Now
00:40:41.839 this information is your credentials and
00:40:44.240 they should be safely stored. uh so no
00:40:47.119 storing credentials and putting them
00:40:49.359 publicly on GitHub. So what we need to
00:40:51.040 do is we need to create av file on our
00:40:54.160 project so that we can access those
00:40:56.079 credentials elsewhere. So how I'm going
00:40:58.000 to do this is I'm going to come over
00:40:59.599 here and I'm going to create an
00:41:02.040 env.lo file and on this file I want to
00:41:06.240 um create variables that are going to
00:41:07.839 represent these um uh values over here.
00:41:11.440 So I'm going to come over here to our
00:41:13.440 envo. Let's create firstly um an
00:41:16.880 environment variable for the endpoint.
00:41:18.640 So I'm going to create here expo public
00:41:22.560 which you have to do because every
00:41:24.160 environment variable you on expo has to
00:41:26.880 be prefixed with expo public and then
00:41:29.839 you write the name of the variable. So
00:41:31.119 in our case it's going to be the apprite
00:41:34.200 endpoint and we're going to set this
00:41:36.240 equal to this value over
00:41:40.200 here. Perfect. Now I'm actually going to
00:41:43.280 copy this already so we don't have to
00:41:45.440 keep coming back. I'm just going to
00:41:47.280 paste it over here. And then let's copy
00:41:49.760 the platform as well. And just paste it
00:41:51.760 over here. Now for the endpoint or for
00:41:54.880 the project ID, I'm just going to paste
00:41:56.880 it like this. And I'm going to call this
00:41:59.200 the project ID. Then for the last one,
00:42:04.240 it's going to be the platform. So I'll
00:42:06.640 just call this platform. Perfect. Now to
00:42:10.400 import it over here, we literally just
00:42:13.040 use
00:42:15.960 process.env dot and then the name of the
00:42:18.160 variable. So in our case over here, we
00:42:19.920 have the endpoint variable. Then we want
00:42:22.720 to use the U project ID variable. So
00:42:26.240 I'll copy this, paste it here. And I'll
00:42:30.640 copy this for the platform as well. And
00:42:32.560 I'll just write platform. So I'll delete
00:42:35.520 this and I'll write platform. Now the
00:42:39.680 reason why it's giving us errors is
00:42:41.119 because we're using TypeScript and uh
00:42:43.599 technically in reality uh you could
00:42:46.880 potentially not have a value for this
00:42:49.280 environment variables. So potentially
00:42:51.760 this
00:42:52.520 process.env whatever name of variable
00:42:54.560 you put could be null. So since we know
00:42:56.880 that we did put those values on theuninv
00:42:59.520 file, let's assert that uh there is a
00:43:03.440 value on this variable. So it removes
00:43:05.839 that little squiggly line. Perfect. And
00:43:07.520 now we have successfully created our
00:43:09.520 client. Now I also want to export this
00:43:11.599 client in case I want to access it later
00:43:13.599 on in our project. But one thing you
00:43:16.000 need to know is that the different
00:43:17.760 services that are available on apprite
00:43:20.240 like authentication and databases they
00:43:22.800 are independent from each other. So you
00:43:25.040 can actually just use app right for O if
00:43:26.960 you wanted to or just use it for the
00:43:28.480 databases without using the other one.
00:43:30.480 So we have to specify what service I
00:43:33.200 want to initialize on my project for
00:43:35.119 apprite. So the one that I want right
00:43:37.119 now is the O service and the way I'm
00:43:39.280 going to do this is I'm going to create
00:43:40.480 a variable called account and I'm going
00:43:42.560 to set this equal to new account and
00:43:46.000 this is what we imported before from
00:43:47.920 React Native apprite. Then in this class
00:43:50.720 over here, I just have to pass my client
00:43:52.960 and I'll export this variable. And with
00:43:54.880 this variable, I can access and make
00:43:56.960 modifications to the user authentication
00:44:00.079 service on apprite. So let's start using
00:44:03.359 it. I'm going to actually close all of
00:44:05.119 this and let's start with our project.
00:44:07.920 So the first thing I want is if I'm
00:44:09.680 going to the app, I want to be able to
00:44:12.400 be prompted with an O page, right? a
00:44:15.520 page that is going to um tell us that we
00:44:18.880 can sign in into our accounts or sign up
00:44:21.839 for an account. I don't want to see the
00:44:23.839 page that we have right now. So to do
00:44:25.839 that, I want to create a new page on my
00:44:28.240 app and it's not going to be part of the
00:44:29.920 tabs because it's not going to be
00:44:31.359 something accessible from the tabs. It's
00:44:33.040 going to be independent from that. So
00:44:34.560 I'll create here another file called
00:44:37.800 O.tsx. And this will represent the O
00:44:41.119 screen for us to be able to sign in and
00:44:43.359 sign up. So I'll export over here a
00:44:46.880 default function called off
00:44:51.160 screen. And now in this off screen I
00:44:54.319 want to return a special component from
00:44:57.440 React Native called the
00:45:00.839 keyboard avoiding view. So this is
00:45:04.319 basically a normal view like we've used
00:45:06.800 already. However, it ensures that the
00:45:08.640 keyboard doesn't overlap whatever we put
00:45:11.760 inside of here which is going to be the
00:45:12.960 form. just so that uh it doesn't annoy
00:45:15.599 you when you're typing on one of the
00:45:17.280 inputs. The keyboard appears on top of
00:45:19.599 it. So, this behavior will change
00:45:21.680 depending on the platform you use. Uh
00:45:23.599 but I just think it looks a lot nicer if
00:45:25.760 you set it up like this. So, you do have
00:45:27.839 to specify here actually the behavior
00:45:30.240 you want out of it. So, I'll just set
00:45:32.560 behavior. And depending on the platform,
00:45:34.960 you have certain keywords that you can
00:45:37.599 use to help it adjust to your screen. So
00:45:41.200 for example, I can get whatever the
00:45:43.280 platform that my React Native app is on
00:45:46.160 by using the
00:45:47.640 platform object from React Native and
00:45:50.400 just getting the OS. This should return
00:45:53.119 either um iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows
00:45:56.800 or web. So those are the options, right?
00:45:58.640 Because those are what you can build
00:45:59.839 with React Native. Now if the platform
00:46:03.040 the OS is equal to iOS then I want to
00:46:06.720 set padding and padding will basically
00:46:10.240 add a padding to the top of this view so
00:46:12.640 that the content isn't covered by the
00:46:14.319 keyboard and this is specific for iOS.
00:46:17.280 Now if it's not so if it's basically
00:46:19.920 Android we want to actually set it to
00:46:22.599 height and what it will do is it will
00:46:25.440 just adjust the height of the view to
00:46:27.200 basically do the same thing make room
00:46:28.800 for the keyboard. So this is what we
00:46:30.880 have to do on a keyboard avoiding view.
00:46:33.119 Now the next thing we want is just a
00:46:34.960 normal view. So I'll put here a
00:46:37.480 view and on this view I want to put a
00:46:41.560 text. Now this text will be the O text.
00:46:45.440 So it could have for example by default
00:46:48.440 create
00:46:49.960 account. Now I need to import this text
00:46:52.640 over here. I'll import from React Native
00:46:55.599 as well.
00:46:57.920 and um I want to see it appearing on the
00:47:00.240 screen. Right now, we're obviously just
00:47:01.520 seeing the homepage or the login page.
00:47:03.839 Those aren't what we want. So, the way
00:47:05.599 we're going to do this is we're actually
00:47:07.359 going to come here to our layout, our
00:47:10.000 default layout. And I want to start
00:47:12.560 building this layout such that it will
00:47:14.800 scale up in our application. Right now,
00:47:17.200 it's just defining the stack, right? The
00:47:19.760 the the stack with the tabs. However,
00:47:22.560 what I can do is I can actually create
00:47:24.480 what is known as a route guard. This is
00:47:27.119 going to basically be a component that
00:47:29.760 is going to uh wrap around our layout
00:47:33.359 and it is going to determine whether or
00:47:35.520 not the user is logged in or not. And if
00:47:38.480 the user is logged in, it will show the
00:47:40.480 off it will show the tabs right with the
00:47:42.960 tab navigation and the actual screens.
00:47:45.280 But if the user is not, it will show the
00:47:47.599 O page. So to do that, I'm going to
00:47:50.000 create here the route guard. And to make
00:47:54.800 this wrapper component, I have to have
00:47:57.640 children being a prop because then I'm
00:48:00.800 going to set the type of this to be
00:48:03.240 children of type react node. React node,
00:48:07.920 sorry. And then down here, what we want
00:48:11.200 to do is we want to basically run the
00:48:13.119 logic to check if the user is off a or
00:48:15.839 not, which right now we don't have that
00:48:17.359 yet. So what I'm going to do is I'll
00:48:19.040 just create an is off variable. I'll set
00:48:22.640 it equal to false. And what we do is we
00:48:25.520 want to check okay, we'll run a use
00:48:28.160 effect to run immediately when this
00:48:30.559 component renders. And if is off is not
00:48:36.920 true, then we'll just replace the user's
00:48:41.680 current route with the off route. So
00:48:44.319 we're kind of forcing here for the
00:48:46.480 moment to actually show the off screen
00:48:49.119 and to actually replace the the route.
00:48:51.920 We can use this important hook called
00:48:55.119 the use router hook. We can import it
00:48:57.920 from expo router. Um it will give us
00:49:01.119 access to this router object. So we say
00:49:04.480 const router is equal to use router and
00:49:07.359 we use this whenever we want to redirect
00:49:09.200 to different parts of the of the app and
00:49:11.680 so on. In our case over here, we
00:49:13.280 basically just want to replace the
00:49:14.640 user's current state to be on the um O
00:49:19.119 route. So we'll say dash off. And you'll
00:49:22.480 see that now if I return here, which in
00:49:25.760 this case since this is just a wrapper
00:49:27.680 component, I just want to return the
00:49:29.880 children, right? I don't want to return
00:49:31.760 any UI. This is literally just meant to
00:49:34.559 check for the O state. And down here I
00:49:38.720 wrap the whole thing with this route
00:49:41.280 guard. So let's wrap the stack with this
00:49:43.920 route guard. You'll see that now it
00:49:45.920 automatically redirects us to the off
00:49:48.079 page. So it shows here the create
00:49:49.839 account which is what we have here on
00:49:51.920 our off page. We'll keep it like that
00:49:54.000 for a second. We'll build this this page
00:49:56.400 first. Um and then we'll we'll go ahead
00:49:58.960 and actually make the the off stuff
00:50:01.680 work. But for now, let's do this. What
00:50:04.319 we want in this page is we want there to
00:50:06.800 be um a text input that is going to be
00:50:10.720 for the email, a text input that is
00:50:12.720 going to be for the password, and then a
00:50:14.400 button to sign in or sign up. Now,
00:50:16.559 because the user will need to sign in
00:50:18.800 and sign up with the same kind of
00:50:20.640 information, we're going to keep this
00:50:21.839 simple in the sense that the user only
00:50:23.599 needs their email and a password to sign
00:50:25.440 up and an email and a password to sign
00:50:27.440 in. We're going to reuse the inputs for
00:50:29.520 both scenarios. So below the text over
00:50:31.839 here, I want to create an input for the
00:50:33.680 email. And the way you do this is with
00:50:35.440 the text input component from React
00:50:38.240 Native. If you've worked with anything
00:50:40.559 uh like HTML or JSX in the past, you
00:50:43.359 know that this is very similar to the
00:50:44.800 input um tag that you can use. Now for
00:50:47.440 the t text input, we're going to pass a
00:50:49.680 label. So the label is going to be
00:50:53.079 email. Then we want to basically set the
00:50:56.319 email to not be able to be capitalized.
00:50:58.400 And we can do this with auto capitalize
00:51:01.280 equal to none because if you've ever
00:51:03.040 worked with anything on your phone
00:51:04.480 before, you've probably noticed that
00:51:05.760 when you start typing it auto capitalize
00:51:08.319 the first letter. So you don't want to
00:51:10.240 do that. You want to keep it the way it
00:51:12.800 is because emails usually don't start
00:51:14.400 with a capital letter. Now the next
00:51:16.480 thing is I want to keep the keyboard
00:51:19.599 uh type. So this is a important thing
00:51:22.000 that you want to put because inputs on
00:51:24.480 your phone change depending on what
00:51:26.240 you're trying to do with it. And uh this
00:51:28.240 prop will determine the type of keyboard
00:51:30.079 layout that will be displayed for the
00:51:31.599 user. So if it's an email, it probably
00:51:34.000 should show the at symbol uh appearing
00:51:36.480 pretty big, right? So that the user can
00:51:38.559 actually use it. Maybe give some
00:51:40.079 recommendations like at Gmail and at um
00:51:43.839 I don't know outlook and so on. So the
00:51:46.319 way we do this is by setting the type to
00:51:48.640 email address. Then we can for now pass
00:51:52.400 a placeholder that will just say
00:51:55.040 something like
00:51:58.200 example@gmail.com. And you should see
00:51:59.680 that now the input appears over here and
00:52:01.839 I can start typing on it. Now obviously
00:52:04.400 the styling we're not doing it yet.
00:52:05.839 We're going to do when we're done with
00:52:06.960 the component. Uh but one thing I want
00:52:09.119 to mention is that some of the styling
00:52:10.800 we're going to have is going to be
00:52:12.079 pretty much automatic. And the reason
00:52:13.680 for that is because we're going to be
00:52:15.280 using React Native paper, which is a
00:52:18.160 really good design library for React
00:52:20.319 Native. It's used everywhere and I
00:52:22.400 highly recommend for making your styles
00:52:24.559 very easily. So, we're going to come
00:52:26.160 over here. We're going to run npx expo
00:52:28.800 install. Uh, I just pressed up and I'll
00:52:31.119 just change this. We're going to install
00:52:33.119 React Native paper. And now when that's
00:52:38.800 done installing in start instead of
00:52:40.880 actually importing some of these UI
00:52:42.880 inputs from React Native, we're actually
00:52:45.200 going to import them from React Native
00:52:48.079 paper. More specifically, I want to
00:52:50.200 import from React Native Paper. And what
00:52:55.200 I want to import is the text component
00:52:58.640 and the text input component. So I'll
00:53:01.440 actually delete these two over here. And
00:53:04.160 we're going to save it. And you'll see
00:53:06.079 that now the input already automatically
00:53:08.960 changed um the way it looks and it looks
00:53:12.160 a little bit better, right? We're
00:53:13.520 obviously going to still style it, but
00:53:14.960 it looks already a little bit better.
00:53:16.400 Also, one of the cool things that the
00:53:18.079 new text input provides, the one from
00:53:20.240 React Native Paper, is this mode uh
00:53:23.520 prop, which basically has the purpose of
00:53:26.319 defining the visual style of the input
00:53:28.480 field. So, like if we set it to
00:53:30.720 outlined, which is what we want,
00:53:33.839 uh, outlined, you'll see that
00:53:35.839 automatically the input turns into this
00:53:38.880 really cool looking outlined input. Now,
00:53:41.200 we're pretty much done with, uh, some of
00:53:42.880 the initial props. We're going to copy
00:53:44.480 this. We're going to paste it again, and
00:53:46.400 we're going to make one for the
00:53:48.200 password, and we'll keep all the other
00:53:50.319 ones the same. Uh, but we're not going
00:53:52.079 to put a placeholder. Uh maybe we can
00:53:54.559 just put like your
00:53:57.480 password or something like that. Uh or
00:54:00.800 actually we don't need placeholders to
00:54:02.640 be honest. Per passwords is very
00:54:04.440 self-explanatory. And you can see that
00:54:06.160 the UI already has this cool animation
00:54:07.839 as well which is really cool from React
00:54:09.359 Native paper. Now the last UI thing we
00:54:12.240 want to do is we want to add a button
00:54:14.000 down here. So we're going to add this
00:54:16.400 button which is also from React Native
00:54:18.319 Paper and we'll just say sign up. And
00:54:22.960 the button will look like this. But we
00:54:25.119 can actually give a mode to it similar
00:54:26.960 to how we did with the text input. And I
00:54:29.119 want to put the
00:54:31.000 contained mode. And then it will get
00:54:33.200 actually filled with the color purple.
00:54:35.359 Now we don't want this to be just the
00:54:37.359 signup page. We want it to be also the
00:54:40.160 sign-in page. And we want to switch it
00:54:42.480 by through a button down here at the
00:54:44.079 bottom. So we're going to copy this
00:54:45.599 button and we're actually going to
00:54:46.720 render another one down here. It's not
00:54:49.200 going to be mode contained. We're
00:54:50.720 actually going to make it mode text. And
00:54:52.720 this will make it into just the normal
00:54:54.240 text. And what I want to do is I want to
00:54:56.640 basically say, do you already have an
00:55:00.440 account? Because if you do, click here
00:55:04.240 to sign
00:55:06.200 in. And we want to click on this and
00:55:08.800 then switch the screen to actually be
00:55:11.280 the signin page. Now, to do that, I need
00:55:13.520 to keep track of if the user is trying
00:55:15.040 to sign in or sign up. So I'm going to
00:55:16.880 create here a state that is going to be
00:55:19.520 called is sign up and we're going to
00:55:23.040 make a function called set is sign
00:55:26.599 up and we're going to set this equal to
00:55:29.040 use state. And what this will do is it
00:55:31.280 is going to keep track of whether or not
00:55:33.520 the user wants to sign in or not. This
00:55:35.680 is going to be a boolean. So, I'm going
00:55:37.520 to set this to boolean and we're going
00:55:40.720 to start it at uh true actually because
00:55:43.760 we're going to assume actually let's
00:55:45.280 start it as false because I'm I'm
00:55:47.200 thinking about it. It's better for us to
00:55:49.920 uh do this for users who are coming
00:55:51.599 back. Right? So, this would just let us
00:55:54.240 know is the user trying to sign up or
00:55:55.920 not. Now, this changes everything
00:55:58.839 because if the user is not trying to
00:56:03.200 sign up, it means they're trying to sign
00:56:04.559 in. meaning that starting already from
00:56:06.720 here we need to change this um text
00:56:10.000 instead of saying create account if is
00:56:12.799 sign up we'll do that so we'll we'll
00:56:15.839 show the create account but if the user
00:56:18.079 is trying to sign in we'll say something
00:56:19.760 like welcome back so this is what it
00:56:23.119 does right if this is true it will say
00:56:25.599 create account if this is false it will
00:56:27.440 say welcome back now same same logic
00:56:30.079 with the button down here right instead
00:56:33.200 of sign up we're going to say sign up if
00:56:37.599 the sign up is true but sign
00:56:40.839 in if it's false. And finally down here
00:56:45.119 we're going to do the same thing uh but
00:56:47.359 it's going to be a little bit bigger.
00:56:48.880 We're going to say if sign up is true
00:56:51.680 then we'll show this text. But if it's
00:56:54.559 false, then we're going to show don't
00:56:58.559 have an account. Question mark sign up.
00:57:03.599 And this is what shows up now. Now, how
00:57:06.400 do we switch between the different
00:57:07.839 modes? Well, I'm going to create here
00:57:11.319 a function called handle switch mode.
00:57:17.400 And I just realized I'm using arrow
00:57:20.000 notation here, but you can use either
00:57:21.599 notation. We've been using normal
00:57:23.200 function notation, but this is the same
00:57:24.799 thing. Now on this switch mode function
00:57:27.200 over here, all I'm doing is I'm setting
00:57:30.160 the is sign up equal to the opposite of
00:57:34.880 what its current value is. And I get its
00:57:37.280 current value by accessing the argument
00:57:40.319 of this function and setting it equal to
00:57:42.160 the opposite of it because if it's true,
00:57:44.799 it will become false. And if it's false,
00:57:46.480 it will become true. Now, I want to call
00:57:49.040 this function when the button down here
00:57:52.160 at the bottom is called. So, you might
00:57:54.400 expect me to put here an on click, but
00:57:56.640 this isn't a website. So, there's no on
00:57:58.799 click on buttons. Instead, it is called
00:58:01.359 on press. But there's also a bunch of
00:58:03.599 other events that you might want to keep
00:58:05.119 in mind um if you ever want to do a
00:58:07.119 little bit different. Now, on this on
00:58:08.720 press, I'll call the handle switch mode.
00:58:10.799 And you'll see that now if I click on
00:58:12.400 this, it switches between signin and
00:58:14.720 sign up. and it will keep switching
00:58:16.599 indefinitely. Perfect. Now, I think we
00:58:19.520 can actually make the styling of this
00:58:21.280 look a little bit better, like centering
00:58:22.960 stuff and just overall making it look
00:58:24.720 better. So, what I want to do is I want
00:58:26.720 to do what we did in the beginning of
00:58:29.280 this course, which is creating a style
00:58:31.839 sheet for this page. So, down here at
00:58:34.319 the bottom, I'm going to create styles.
00:58:37.680 And I'm going to set it equal to style
00:58:40.440 sheet dot create.
00:58:44.799 And then I need to actually import this.
00:58:47.040 Did I import it? No, I didn't. So I'll
00:58:49.280 import from um React Native
00:58:53.319 stylesheet. And I'll say create and I'll
00:58:57.280 pass an object. Now the first thing I
00:58:59.119 want to pass is a container that we're
00:59:00.960 going to have for this page. It's going
00:59:02.640 to encompass the whole p the whole
00:59:04.240 screen. So the styling for this
00:59:06.480 container is going to be flex is equal
00:59:08.640 to one and a background
00:59:11.160 color equal to and I want to put this
00:59:14.160 color over here. It's going to be kind
00:59:15.839 of like matching the style of what we
00:59:18.079 have for um the the buttons and the
00:59:20.960 inputs. It's going to be a hexodimal F5
00:59:25.040 F5 F5. Now to apply this, we're going to
00:59:28.960 come here to our view. And on this top
00:59:31.520 one over here, I'm going to set the
00:59:32.880 style equal to the
00:59:36.599 styles.container. And I'm going to save
00:59:38.319 this. And you might have not already
00:59:40.880 noticed the difference, but let's apply
00:59:43.280 also a style for this view over here.
00:59:45.760 I'm going to call this
00:59:47.720 content. And on the styles over here,
00:59:50.480 let's double this and create a style for
00:59:52.799 the content. Now for this one, we're
00:59:55.280 going to keep flex is equal to one as
00:59:56.880 well. But we're going to put um padding.
01:00:00.799 So I'm going to put a padding of
01:00:02.680 16. When I save this, you see
01:00:04.799 immediately everything gets a little bit
01:00:06.880 um it does it's not actually stretched
01:00:08.640 out. And then I also want to justify the
01:00:11.040 content to be center so that we have
01:00:14.720 everything in the center of the screen.
01:00:16.640 Now obviously there's padding issues
01:00:18.319 still. So we're going to address that. I
01:00:20.480 want to first deal with this title over
01:00:22.079 here. So, I'm going to create the
01:00:25.480 title object. Uh, so we'll come here to
01:00:29.280 the text and I'm just going to say style
01:00:32.079 is equal to
01:00:34.839 styles.title. Now, it looks weird cuz I
01:00:37.440 just copied the styles from the content.
01:00:39.200 But for the the title, what I want to do
01:00:41.599 is I want to text align it to the
01:00:44.960 center. So, it's on the center of this
01:00:47.040 input. And then I want to set a margin
01:00:51.000 bottom of 24 so it doesn't look too like
01:00:55.119 too close to the inputs. Now the next
01:00:57.839 style will be the input. And I'll do the
01:01:00.319 input and the button at the same time so
01:01:02.160 we're not constantly scrolling up and
01:01:03.760 down. I'll do the input over here and
01:01:06.559 the button. Now, for the input, what we
01:01:09.599 want to do is we just want to have a
01:01:10.799 margin bottom from the bottom of the of
01:01:12.880 each other. So, it's not too close to
01:01:14.640 the button and not too close to each
01:01:16.480 other as well. So, I'll keep here the
01:01:18.480 margin bottom, but I'll make it a little
01:01:20.480 bit smaller. I'm going to make it 16.
01:01:22.720 And you'll see how that looks. Now, for
01:01:24.559 the bottom, for the button, I actually
01:01:26.640 want to have a margin
01:01:28.119 top. And the margin top is going to be
01:01:30.400 an eight. And that should be good. We're
01:01:33.280 going to come here to the inputs. We're
01:01:34.960 going to copy this.
01:01:37.040 We're going to apply them to the both
01:01:40.440 inputs. And I'll copy for this as well
01:01:42.880 and put it here. You see this is how it
01:01:44.880 changes. It just creates more space. And
01:01:47.119 then for the buttons, we're going to
01:01:49.839 apply here
01:01:51.400 styles. Perfect. Now, I'm not going to
01:01:53.920 apply it to the other button because
01:01:55.520 this one actually will have a different
01:01:57.359 styling. It's going to be called the
01:02:00.920 switch mode button.
01:02:04.240 Uh, so we'll create it down
01:02:06.920 here. And with the switch mode button,
01:02:10.079 what I want to do is I just want to set
01:02:12.400 a margin top of 16. So there's actually
01:02:15.119 more space, double the space. Perfect.
01:02:18.400 And I want to apply actually I look I
01:02:20.799 just noticed this looks a little bit
01:02:22.319 plain. So let's put a variant to the
01:02:25.200 text with this text component from app
01:02:27.920 from React Native paper. We can pass a
01:02:30.640 variant here. And a variant that we want
01:02:32.720 to apply is the
01:02:34.520 headline variant uh to make it a little
01:02:37.520 bit bigger. But I'm also going to set it
01:02:39.040 to medium. And I wrote this wrong. I
01:02:43.040 shouldn't have put the A here. And it
01:02:44.880 should look a little bit bigger.
01:02:47.160 Perfect. Now we're ready to actually
01:02:50.240 implement the logic behind allowing the
01:02:52.480 user to authenticate. So the way we're
01:02:54.559 going to do this is we're going to
01:02:56.480 create here a function that is going to
01:02:59.119 be called handle
01:03:02.280 o. And this function will handle both
01:03:05.040 creating and signing into an account.
01:03:08.000 And we're going to call it whenever the
01:03:10.079 user presses the signin button. So we'll
01:03:12.720 go to this button and we're going to do
01:03:14.559 an on press and we're going to pass the
01:03:17.039 handle off. Now on this function we need
01:03:20.319 to make it a sync because this is going
01:03:23.039 to be calling our apprite API to
01:03:26.079 actually sign in or sign up the user.
01:03:28.480 Now to do that we need to keep track of
01:03:31.440 what the user is typing on the inputs.
01:03:34.720 So I need to create a state that is
01:03:37.280 going to keep track of that value for
01:03:39.440 the email and one for the password. So
01:03:41.920 up here I'm going to create an email uh
01:03:45.599 state with a set email function and it's
01:03:49.359 going to be equal to use state uh string
01:03:53.039 and it's going to be an empty string at
01:03:55.119 first but I'm also going to create a
01:03:57.640 password over here and a set
01:04:01.720 password. Perfect. Now what I want to do
01:04:04.799 is when the user is typing on this
01:04:07.760 inputs I want to change the values of
01:04:09.680 those states. So the way we do this with
01:04:11.920 a text input is we pass in on change
01:04:16.200 text and we call the set email function.
01:04:21.520 So we just say set email. We don't have
01:04:24.720 even have to do any handling because it
01:04:27.200 does it automatically for us because
01:04:29.119 this is an on onchange text. It knows to
01:04:31.839 set the value through here. Now we can
01:04:34.319 do the exact same thing with the
01:04:36.480 password. So I'm going to say set
01:04:39.079 password and it will keep track of that
01:04:41.440 as well. So the first check that I need
01:04:44.079 to make on this function is do we have
01:04:46.079 any email or password because if we
01:04:48.000 don't have one of those then we don't
01:04:50.640 want to actually allow the user to try
01:04:52.160 to sign in or sign up. So we come over
01:04:54.160 here and we say if not email or not
01:04:58.920 password then there is an issue. Now the
01:05:02.480 way we're going to keep track of issues
01:05:03.920 is through a state which is going to be
01:05:06.559 called an error state. So we're going to
01:05:08.640 say const error is equal to set error.
01:05:13.280 And I wrote error wrong. Uh and it's
01:05:15.920 going to be a use state which will be a
01:05:18.400 string or null possibly. If there's no
01:05:21.200 errors it will be null. Now in this
01:05:24.240 function over here, I'm going to set the
01:05:26.240 error equal to um probably something
01:05:28.880 like please fill in all fields. And if
01:05:33.920 there is an error, I want to display it
01:05:36.319 on the screen for the user. So let's go
01:05:39.039 down here and in between the button for
01:05:41.440 submitting and the button for and the
01:05:43.839 inputs, we're going to actually check to
01:05:45.680 see if there's any errors. And if there
01:05:47.520 is an error, I want to
01:05:50.599 show the text like I use text and I'll
01:05:54.559 show the error over here. So in case I
01:05:58.000 just try signing in right now, you'll
01:06:00.000 see it will show up. Please fill in all
01:06:02.160 fields because that's the error that we
01:06:04.480 set over here. Also, we want to return
01:06:06.799 because we're going to put some logic
01:06:08.000 down here that we wouldn't want to
01:06:09.839 execute if this is the case. Also, let's
01:06:12.640 make this error look a little bit
01:06:13.920 better. A way we can do this is by
01:06:15.680 setting some styling which can we can
01:06:18.640 actually apply through the colors that
01:06:21.440 we can get from react native paper. So
01:06:23.760 what I mean by that is if I come over
01:06:25.520 here and I say style and I apply a color
01:06:29.359 right I can say red and this will make
01:06:32.000 it red. But I think this red doesn't
01:06:33.599 look that good. What I can do instead is
01:06:36.079 I can use this function from react or
01:06:38.480 this hook from react native paper called
01:06:40.480 use theme. And what this hook does is it
01:06:43.200 gives us access to their theme including
01:06:45.280 their colors. So I'll say theme is equal
01:06:48.160 to use theme and they have theme colors
01:06:51.440 for like anything including um a color
01:06:54.960 for a situation in which there's an
01:06:57.200 error. So I can say theme colors and
01:07:00.160 then I can access uh for example error
01:07:03.039 which is the actual color that I wanted
01:07:05.119 to try. And you'll see that it looks a
01:07:06.880 lot more in line with the rest of the
01:07:08.880 theme for React Native paper. Now let's
01:07:11.359 do some minor validation because most of
01:07:13.839 the validation we can actually do on the
01:07:15.359 back end. In our case over here we just
01:07:17.280 want to check is the
01:07:19.559 password.length less than six because if
01:07:22.000 there is if it is then I want to set the
01:07:26.319 error to be
01:07:30.359 passwords must be at least six
01:07:36.760 characters
01:07:38.359 long. And then you'll see that if I
01:07:40.799 return here as well, um, if there's
01:07:44.319 nothing in signed up, it will still give
01:07:46.559 us this error. But if I put here an
01:07:48.319 email,
01:07:50.079 um, and then I put a really small
01:07:53.440 password. Now, this is the error message
01:07:55.760 that I get because we don't want people
01:07:57.039 to put very small passwords cuz it's
01:07:58.640 unsafe. Perfect. Now we're going to come
01:08:01.039 over here and we're going to set the
01:08:04.559 error to be equal to null just in case
01:08:07.359 error was set to something else right uh
01:08:09.599 like in this situation over here we want
01:08:11.359 to set it to null so that we restart and
01:08:13.839 we actually do the authentication. Now,
01:08:16.960 in order to do this, we're actually
01:08:19.279 going to separate our logic for
01:08:21.600 authenticating, for signing in and
01:08:23.279 signing up, and also keeping track of
01:08:25.040 whether the user signed up or not uh
01:08:27.359 through a hook that we're going to
01:08:29.040 create, which is going to utilize the
01:08:32.719 the context API from um React. So, the
01:08:36.238 way we're going to do this is we're
01:08:37.759 going to create uh I'll just create it
01:08:39.520 here on our lib. Uh it doesn't really
01:08:41.359 matter. I'm going to create it. I'm
01:08:42.560 going to create the o context.ts.
01:08:46.198 tsx file. Now on this file I want to
01:08:49.920 make two things. The first thing I want
01:08:51.759 to make is a provider that we're going
01:08:54.479 to be using for distributing information
01:08:57.120 about authentication on our project. So
01:08:59.520 I'm going to say export function o
01:09:04.279 provider and I'll create this provider.
01:09:06.960 It's a wrapper component. So we have to
01:09:08.880 do something very similar to what we did
01:09:10.560 with the route guard where we get the
01:09:14.279 children and the type will be
01:09:17.560 children with a
01:09:20.520 react
01:09:22.759 node. Now I obviously forgot to close
01:09:25.839 this but now it works. Um and then we'll
01:09:29.880 return something here which I won't uh
01:09:33.600 return for now. But the second thing I
01:09:35.520 want to export from this file is I want
01:09:38.880 to
01:09:39.560 export a function or hook called the use
01:09:43.600 off hook that it is going to use the
01:09:47.279 context that is being created on this O
01:09:49.920 provider and actually return to us
01:09:52.560 everywhere that we needed to. So we
01:09:54.320 don't have to constantly be importing
01:09:56.000 the O context that we're going to create
01:09:58.640 um in every single file that we do. Um,
01:10:00.960 so this is a nifty way for us to
01:10:02.560 actually make this work in an easy way.
01:10:05.040 So what we want to do is on this O
01:10:07.440 provider, we want to create um a
01:10:09.840 context. So I'll actually make it
01:10:11.280 outside of it so we have access to it
01:10:12.880 here as well. We're going to create the
01:10:15.640 O context. Now this O context we're
01:10:19.520 going to be using create context from
01:10:21.760 React and we want to set it to undefined
01:10:25.080 initially but we want to define the type
01:10:28.400 of this O context since we're using
01:10:30.280 TypeScript. So I'll define type O
01:10:34.280 context type or I'll just yeah context
01:10:38.440 type. Now in this we want to what what
01:10:42.880 information do we want to keep track of
01:10:45.199 in this context? Well, first of all, we
01:10:48.239 want to distribute information about the
01:10:50.320 user who's logged in, right? Because
01:10:52.159 everywhere in our in our app, we want to
01:10:54.400 keep track of that information. So,
01:10:56.400 we're going to pass in this user
01:11:00.040 information. Now, we don't have a type
01:11:02.159 for user at, but what we can use is um
01:11:06.400 in apprite you can actually import the
01:11:10.239 user type from apprite. So you can
01:11:13.280 import models from React Native app,
01:11:16.000 right? And the the type for a user is
01:11:18.560 going to be models do
01:11:21.239 user and we pass here as well
01:11:25.640 models.preferences and potentially the
01:11:28.000 user can also be null if they're not
01:11:29.760 authenticated. So this is the user type.
01:11:32.560 Now the second thing I want to keep
01:11:34.159 track of is just the functions that
01:11:36.080 we're going to be using. Now, we're
01:11:37.360 going to be changing this O context uh
01:11:39.440 as we add more stuff, but for now, we
01:11:41.199 just want to keep track of the user and
01:11:43.280 if they like a function for them to sign
01:11:45.960 up, which has a type of function which
01:11:50.400 returns a
01:11:51.960 promise, which is a void. And I'm also
01:11:55.120 going to make a signin type. So, I'll
01:11:57.679 say sign in. Now, this function um is
01:12:01.440 going to require us to pass in the email
01:12:03.600 and the password, right? to sign up, we
01:12:05.360 need to pass in that information and to
01:12:06.719 sign in as well. So when we're defining
01:12:09.280 the the type of it, I'm going to set the
01:12:12.199 email to be one of the things we need to
01:12:14.719 get from it and the password as
01:12:17.560 well. Now I'll do the exact same thing
01:12:20.000 on the
01:12:21.000 signin and I'll pass this off context
01:12:24.000 type as a type to this create context.
01:12:28.239 Now initially it's also undefined. So
01:12:30.320 that's why I'm going to also say it can
01:12:32.960 be undefined. Now we created this O
01:12:36.239 context and what we want to do is we
01:12:38.400 want to use it to make this O provider
01:12:41.520 return a provider that is going to wrap
01:12:43.840 the children that is that we wrap this
01:12:46.159 component around. So I'm going to return
01:12:48.800 here the O context dot provider to turn
01:12:53.360 this into a provider. And I'll do the
01:12:55.679 same thing here. And I need to pass a
01:12:58.239 value to it. More specifically, I need
01:13:00.640 to pass an object that is going to
01:13:02.080 include a user, a signup, and a sign in.
01:13:05.280 So, I'll make here user, sign up, and
01:13:09.840 sign in. Now, obviously, we haven't made
01:13:11.840 those things yet, but we are going to
01:13:13.280 make them in a second. Now, the last
01:13:15.280 thing I need is I need to basically
01:13:17.679 render the children that we get from the
01:13:20.000 prop directly inside of this, or else
01:13:22.960 this wouldn't be a wrapper component.
01:13:25.040 Perfect. Now we can create the
01:13:28.560 information for the user for the signup
01:13:30.320 and for the signin. Now let's start with
01:13:32.159 the sign up right. So we're going to
01:13:35.199 make a function here called sign up. And
01:13:37.600 like we defined the type over here it is
01:13:39.920 going to take in as an argument um an
01:13:43.440 email and a password. And it's also
01:13:45.920 going to be an async function because we
01:13:48.880 need to call it on this handle off
01:13:51.520 function that we basically left behind.
01:13:53.360 But we're going to get back to it. We
01:13:54.560 just need to make this first. Now on the
01:13:57.120 signup function, I want to try to
01:14:00.480 execute the sign up operation on
01:14:03.600 app.right, but if there's any errors, we
01:14:06.560 want to catch them and we'll handle what
01:14:09.360 happens down here. Now on the try, I
01:14:12.480 want to try to
01:14:15.080 await and this is where I use the
01:14:17.840 account that we created on the apprite
01:14:20.560 file, right? on this account over here
01:14:23.199 because with this account I can
01:14:24.560 basically say
01:14:26.360 account.create and this will create a
01:14:28.719 user in our project. Now to create a
01:14:31.600 user we have to pass three things. We
01:14:33.199 have to pass an ID, an email and a
01:14:35.360 password. And we already have the email
01:14:37.040 and the password. So we can do it like
01:14:39.440 this. But we don't have the ID and
01:14:41.520 actually the ID is the thing that we
01:14:42.719 pass first. Now the ID we can generate
01:14:45.760 through this ID um object that we have
01:14:49.280 here from apprite and we can call the
01:14:52.000 unique function and this will generate a
01:14:54.000 unique ID for our user
01:14:56.120 automatically. Now after this I also
01:14:59.199 want to sign in the user after they
01:15:01.679 create their account automatically just
01:15:03.440 sign them in. So what I'm going to do is
01:15:06.000 I'm going to say await
01:15:08.760 signin. Uh, and obviously we don't have
01:15:10.960 the function yet, but we'll just
01:15:12.560 duplicate this for now. Um, and we'll
01:15:16.320 call this sign
01:15:17.960 in. But we're going to call the sign-in
01:15:20.320 function with the same email and
01:15:22.080 password so that when you sign up, you
01:15:24.239 actually sign in as well. Now, what we
01:15:26.800 do when we catch any errors here is we
01:15:29.440 want to return that error message or
01:15:31.840 return some error message. So, I'm
01:15:33.840 actually going to change the type of
01:15:35.120 this to potentially return either a
01:15:39.640 string or
01:15:42.159 uh return null. And this means that if
01:15:45.760 you return a string, there was an error
01:15:47.440 in this process. And if you return null,
01:15:49.120 it means there was no errors. So, in
01:15:51.840 this case over here, we're going to
01:15:53.520 return null. Now, if there's an issue,
01:15:56.880 then we want to check to see if the
01:15:59.120 error is of type. it's an instance of
01:16:03.360 the generic error type uh that we have
01:16:06.159 in JavaScript. And if it is, then I want
01:16:08.880 to return
01:16:11.480 um the error message because then I'll
01:16:16.239 return the string with the actual error
01:16:17.840 message. If not, then we'll just return
01:16:21.120 a generic error message that will say an
01:16:24.719 error
01:16:26.920 occurred during signup.
01:16:30.800 Perfect. Now, we'll copy this exact
01:16:33.440 logic and we're just going to paste it
01:16:34.800 here on the signin. We're just not going
01:16:36.560 to call the sign in again because that
01:16:37.920 would make it into an infinite loop. Uh,
01:16:41.040 but what we want to do is instead of the
01:16:44.120 account.create for you to sign into an
01:16:46.320 account, you actually do
01:16:49.000 account.create email password session.
01:16:52.480 And this will create a session using the
01:16:54.960 user's email and password, right? Just
01:16:57.120 like the name implies. So, we can just
01:16:58.880 use the email password from the
01:17:00.080 arguments and that should be good to go
01:17:02.159 as well. Now, we'll just change this to
01:17:04.320 sign in in case there's an error uh
01:17:07.280 because it's not signup. Now, we we're
01:17:10.640 now good to go for the sign in and sign
01:17:12.320 up. I'm actually going to comment out
01:17:14.400 the user for now just because uh we
01:17:18.560 don't have a point of writing the logic
01:17:21.120 for getting the user info yet since we
01:17:23.360 haven't even implemented the sign in and
01:17:25.360 signup. So for now we'll just take that
01:17:27.600 out and let's uh now test this on our
01:17:31.199 actual screen. Now to have this
01:17:34.560 information from this provider be
01:17:36.560 distributed on every single screen on
01:17:38.640 our app, we have to wrap this O provider
01:17:42.640 around our layout. So we'll go here to
01:17:45.120 our layouts and um on the top over here
01:17:48.239 even above the route guard we want to
01:17:50.400 wrap it with the O
01:17:52.440 provider so that everything below it
01:17:55.280 will have access to the information
01:17:57.040 inside of it. Now how are people going
01:17:58.960 to have access to it? Like how are we
01:18:00.960 going to get the uh sign in or the
01:18:03.440 signup functions for example on this o
01:18:06.080 component? Well we could use the use
01:18:07.920 context hook every single time. However,
01:18:10.239 this use o function over here or hook is
01:18:14.000 actually going to make it a lot easier
01:18:15.199 for us because we can this we can get
01:18:17.760 the context from it. So I'm going to say
01:18:20.000 use context and I'm just going to use
01:18:22.239 the o context inside of here. So we get
01:18:24.719 back everything from this provider and
01:18:27.199 then if context is equal to undefined.
01:18:31.600 So if for some reason we are calling
01:18:34.320 this use off and we're not in the inside
01:18:37.280 the O provider then we do have to throw
01:18:40.640 an error that says use off must be
01:18:45.920 inside of the O provider. I mean that's
01:18:49.600 not going to happen cuz we're going to
01:18:50.960 make sure it won't. Um but in that case
01:18:53.440 then we throw an error. If not we just
01:18:56.000 return the context. And that means that
01:18:57.920 now for example in the O component over
01:19:00.640 here we can get the sign in and sign out
01:19:04.000 uh the sign in and sign up functions by
01:19:06.480 just calling the use O hook. So now we
01:19:11.920 get access to the sign in and sign up.
01:19:15.840 Now we can use the sign in and sign up.
01:19:18.480 So I'm going to come here to after we
01:19:21.040 set the error to null. And if you
01:19:23.679 remember, we already checked to see if
01:19:26.400 the email and password are there or if
01:19:28.400 the password is greater than six
01:19:30.400 characters. So what we can do is we can
01:19:33.159 try to um sign up. Actually, since we're
01:19:38.400 handling this, we're returning
01:19:39.679 everything automatically. So I don't
01:19:40.800 even need to worry about that. I'm just
01:19:42.239 going to actually say if sign up of if
01:19:46.239 is sign up is equal to true, then I will
01:19:50.080 call the signup function. If not, I want
01:19:54.320 to call the sign-in function. So, I'm
01:19:57.199 going to
01:19:58.600 await sign up and I'll pass the email
01:20:02.960 and password to the function. And in
01:20:05.840 this case, I'm going to do the exact
01:20:08.880 same thing but for sign in. But remember
01:20:11.840 that these functions, they return uh
01:20:14.560 potentially an error, right? So, I'm
01:20:18.080 going to get the error back. And if
01:20:21.520 there's an
01:20:22.600 error, so
01:20:24.679 if there is an error, I want to set the
01:20:29.199 error equal to that error and then
01:20:32.560 return. Now on the signin, I want to do
01:20:36.640 the exact same thing, but if the sign-in
01:20:40.159 is successful, I want to use the use
01:20:42.800 router hook. So actually, I need to
01:20:45.679 import the use router hook. And I'm
01:20:48.880 going to create a router over here like
01:20:52.080 we've done in the past. And with this I
01:20:55.360 can actually redirect the user to a
01:20:58.000 different page like the homepage for
01:20:59.760 example. So I can say router
01:21:03.320 dotreplace and then bring them to
01:21:07.480 the homepage.
01:21:10.000 Now, we can test this, but I think the
01:21:12.239 best way for us to test it for now is to
01:21:14.320 actually go to the um to the app right
01:21:19.199 off O page over here. And as users are
01:21:21.760 being created, they're going to appear
01:21:23.679 on our screen. So, I'm going to come
01:21:26.800 back here to the code and I want to
01:21:32.080 create a new account. I'm going to use
01:21:34.320 an email that I have for testing for
01:21:36.800 videos. It's called Pedrotech Rumés. Uh,
01:21:39.440 and I'm going to create an account with
01:21:40.960 it. So, let's put an email and I'll put
01:21:42.960 a password. It's going to be password
01:21:45.920 one, two, three. I just realized that
01:21:47.600 this shouldn't be appearing, right? Cuz
01:21:49.679 this is a password field. So, one thing
01:21:51.600 we could do is uh on this keyboard type
01:21:55.360 over here, we actually don't want to
01:21:57.920 keep this as an email. We actually just
01:22:00.320 copy and paste it from the above one. We
01:22:02.400 want to change it. But also, we want to
01:22:04.560 make it such that this is a secure text
01:22:06.719 entry. We do that by literally setting
01:22:08.960 secure text entry and then it will kind
01:22:10.960 of remove the text, right? So people
01:22:12.960 don't see it. Now I'm going to click on
01:22:15.679 uh sign up and if everything is
01:22:18.600 successful then we should see on the
01:22:22.800 account over here the user
01:22:25.400 appearing. Now you see immediately the
01:22:27.920 user appeared on the screen. Now there
01:22:30.159 was an issue probably with the signing
01:22:34.239 in. Um, I can try signing in with the
01:22:36.719 same account. Uh, it says creating of a
01:22:39.360 session is prohibited. Which one
01:22:40.719 session? Oh, yeah. We actually have the
01:22:43.040 section active. I forgot. So, everything
01:22:45.440 worked, but we since we're just
01:22:48.600 forcefully setting the O um page, it's
01:22:52.800 not actually redirecting to the
01:22:54.080 homepage. We still have to implement
01:22:55.600 that. So, we're going to do that. So,
01:22:57.440 let's think about exactly what we want.
01:22:59.600 We want in this layout.tsx tsx file over
01:23:02.400 here to actually check to see if the
01:23:05.199 user is authenticated or not uh using
01:23:08.320 apprite. So in order to do that we want
01:23:10.960 to make some changes to our o context.
01:23:14.880 So in here let's go up here. We want to
01:23:17.840 add again the user property because the
01:23:20.400 way we're going to do this is somewhere
01:23:21.840 inside of our o provider we're going to
01:23:23.440 use appite to detect if the user um
01:23:26.480 exists. And if the user exists, meaning
01:23:28.639 the user is logged in, we're going to
01:23:30.239 set this user variable equal to that.
01:23:32.480 And that's a way for us to know if the
01:23:33.760 user is logged in or not. Because if
01:23:35.280 this user object is null, then it means
01:23:37.520 they're not. And um if it's set to
01:23:39.840 something, it means that the user is
01:23:41.679 authenticated. Now, an easy way for us
01:23:43.520 to do this is we want to create a state
01:23:45.840 that is going to keep track of the user.
01:23:48.320 So, we're going to create here a const.
01:23:50.719 We'll call it user, and we'll create a
01:23:53.120 function called set user. And we'll set
01:23:55.120 this equal to use state. Now the type of
01:23:58.960 this state is going to be the same type
01:24:00.960 that we set up here, right? It's going
01:24:02.960 to be the models user and possibly null
01:24:05.280 as well. Now initially obviously since
01:24:07.600 there's no authentication, uh the user
01:24:10.239 will be null. Now the next thing we want
01:24:13.920 is we want to have some sort of function
01:24:16.560 that is going to get the user. So I'm
01:24:19.280 going to create here get user and it's
01:24:22.880 going to be an async
01:24:24.520 function that we're going to try to
01:24:28.960 check to see if there's a session for
01:24:31.520 this user. Now to do that we're going to
01:24:33.440 say const session and we can use the
01:24:36.960 account variable similar to what we did
01:24:38.560 here for creating and for signing in. We
01:24:42.080 can use
01:24:43.800 account.get and this needs to be awaited
01:24:46.239 because this returns a promise. So await
01:24:49.520 account.get and if there is a valid
01:24:51.760 session then we're going to get that
01:24:54.400 back and it's going to set that to the
01:24:55.920 session variable. So we can then set the
01:24:58.320 user equal to this session. Now if there
01:25:01.840 is any other errors so if there's a
01:25:05.120 catch right we are going to catch that
01:25:08.880 error. And to be honest all we're going
01:25:11.040 to do is we're going to set user equal
01:25:12.880 to null. We don't want to actually
01:25:15.520 display anything because it's not an
01:25:17.040 issue. It's not an error um for the user
01:25:19.280 to not be authenticated. It just means
01:25:20.639 that they they shouldn't have access to
01:25:22.639 the rest of the app. Now, we can now
01:25:25.679 call this get user function every time
01:25:29.199 the O provider renders. So, on its
01:25:31.840 initial render, we can call this. And to
01:25:34.000 do that, we're going to be using the use
01:25:36.080 effect hook. This hook, like many of you
01:25:38.800 might know, it basically will run and
01:25:41.280 execute code uh when the code when the
01:25:43.679 page first renders or when a screen
01:25:45.360 first renders. And we have to make sure
01:25:46.719 we put this empty dependency array so
01:25:48.880 that it doesn't actually infinitely uh
01:25:51.520 refresh and re reload this component. So
01:25:54.239 inside of here, we're just going to call
01:25:55.920 get user and it should now make that
01:26:00.320 assumption and and set the value of user
01:26:02.960 equal to either the session or keep it
01:26:05.040 as null. Now we can successfully pass
01:26:07.840 this user value to this uh O provider
01:26:11.600 and we now have access to that elsewhere
01:26:13.440 in our app. Where do we want to use it?
01:26:15.199 Well, we're going to use it in multiple
01:26:16.320 places in our app, but more
01:26:17.280 specifically, we want to use it in our
01:26:18.960 layout. Inside of this route go guard
01:26:21.040 over here, we want to check to see if
01:26:22.639 the user is authenticated. So, the
01:26:24.880 easiest way to do that is we're going to
01:26:26.480 actually delete this variable. We're
01:26:28.400 going to call the the use o. So, I'm
01:26:32.080 going to say equals to use
01:26:34.520 o. And in here, we're going to get back
01:26:37.440 the user.
01:26:39.679 Um, then inside of this use effect, I
01:26:43.120 want to redirect the user if to the off
01:26:47.040 page if the user object is null. But
01:26:50.800 also, I don't want to do that if the
01:26:52.400 user is already in the off page, right?
01:26:54.080 Cuz that's redundant. So a way what I
01:26:56.800 can do is I can actually detect what
01:26:58.400 screen the user is inside of at the
01:27:00.400 moment and not actually redirect them if
01:27:03.520 they are already in the off page. To do
01:27:05.440 that we we can use the use segments
01:27:08.719 hook. So segments will help us have
01:27:12.239 access to the information of where in
01:27:14.000 the app the user is. We get that through
01:27:16.480 the use segments hook similar to the use
01:27:18.480 router. And what we can do is I can
01:27:20.719 detect if the user is already in the O
01:27:23.040 page by saying const in O group is equal
01:27:28.080 to segments. And then if I get the first
01:27:30.800 element of the segments array and that's
01:27:33.120 equal to O then I know that it's in the
01:27:36.239 O page. Uh now why we need that is
01:27:39.679 because now I can detect if the user
01:27:42.800 doesn't exist meaning they're not
01:27:44.080 authenticated and the user is not in the
01:27:47.280 O page then let's redirect them to the O
01:27:51.199 screen. But if not, so else if the user
01:27:57.040 exists and the user is in the O group,
01:28:03.440 then we want to actually do the opposite
01:28:05.920 because uh the user is authenticated but
01:28:10.320 they're seeing the sign-in screen. We
01:28:11.600 don't want that to happen, right? So we
01:28:13.040 redirect them to the homepage. So those
01:28:15.040 are the only two scenarios. We don't
01:28:16.080 want to put an else here because we
01:28:17.360 don't want to redirect people for no
01:28:18.800 reason. The only two scenarios in which
01:28:20.480 we want to redirect them in this route
01:28:22.239 card is if they're not authenticated and
01:28:24.320 not in the O screen or if they are
01:28:26.719 authenticated and are in the off screen.
01:28:30.000 So I hope you guys understand this. Uh
01:28:32.400 now one thing we have to do is in this
01:28:34.239 use effect now because we're doing a lot
01:28:36.639 of like different um checks in here. we
01:28:39.199 should probably put some uh dependencies
01:28:41.679 to this dependency array because things
01:28:44.080 might change in your in your app and you
01:28:46.880 want to adapt this use effect every time
01:28:49.120 different pieces of state changes. The
01:28:51.120 first thing we want to put here is the
01:28:52.639 user if the user off change then we want
01:28:56.000 to run this use effect again. Now we
01:28:58.239 also want to change uh run this again if
01:29:00.480 the segments change and also because uh
01:29:03.920 then part of this logic will be impacted
01:29:06.800 specifically the in off group uh boolean
01:29:10.159 right so now we are pretty much done
01:29:13.280 with this part now we should also think
01:29:16.400 about the following scenario in our use
01:29:19.280 o over here there's a small leap of
01:29:22.719 second right in between getting the
01:29:25.120 actual session and in that moment even
01:29:26.960 though the user might be authenticated
01:29:28.960 just because we haven't received back
01:29:30.800 the information of whether or not a
01:29:32.560 session is active, the user will be null
01:29:35.120 because we set it to null initially. So
01:29:37.840 if the user is not in the O group and
01:29:40.000 they are user, this might trigger a
01:29:42.639 replacement, right? They might be
01:29:44.080 redirect to the O page even though it in
01:29:46.880 3 seconds we will detect that they are
01:29:48.719 actually authenticated and uh that
01:29:51.040 shouldn't have been the case. So one
01:29:52.880 thing we can do is we can actually
01:29:54.320 create a new state on our of context and
01:29:57.520 that state is going to keep track of
01:29:59.199 whether or not we are loading the
01:30:01.520 information about the user. So we're
01:30:04.000 going to actually create here a loading
01:30:06.239 or let's actually make it is loading.
01:30:09.360 It's a boolean and um I'll call it is
01:30:12.800 loading user makes more sense. And then
01:30:15.760 inside of this we want to actually
01:30:17.600 create a state for this uh boolean. So
01:30:20.400 we'll say const is loading user and
01:30:25.280 we'll create a set is loading user set
01:30:29.679 is equal to use state and it will be a
01:30:32.719 boolean that starts with false and it
01:30:35.520 will be a boolean that starts with true
01:30:38.960 because initially we'll always be making
01:30:41.760 the request to check the user. Now after
01:30:45.440 the user is done being checked right
01:30:48.880 either they
01:30:50.360 successfully found a session or the user
01:30:53.679 isn't authenticated or there's an error
01:30:55.679 or something we want to set the loading
01:30:58.159 to false because the request is done. So
01:31:00.159 a way we can do this is we can put a
01:31:02.400 finally clause here in the try catch and
01:31:04.719 this finally will run after either these
01:31:06.960 two cases. So in that scenario we just
01:31:09.120 want to set this to false because now it
01:31:11.600 is not loading anymore. And now we can
01:31:13.679 pass that value to the uh value over
01:31:17.440 here. So we can pass uh the is loading
01:31:21.440 user as a part of this. And now in here
01:31:24.560 in our layout we want to implement that
01:31:27.920 is loading user because now we only want
01:31:30.960 to redirect if the is loading user is
01:31:33.520 false because we don't want to make any
01:31:35.360 abrupt changes unless the actual
01:31:37.679 information is finished loading. So for
01:31:39.199 example, we'll put here if is loading
01:31:42.000 user is false and we'll put here the
01:31:45.040 exact same thing. Perfect. Now sometimes
01:31:48.800 when you are out or redirecting like
01:31:50.639 this, you might run into issues where
01:31:52.320 it's saying that um you're attempting to
01:31:55.199 navigate before mounting, but it's
01:31:56.880 because we're still building our app. So
01:31:58.639 that might cause some issues. What I
01:32:00.719 would do is I'll just come here, close
01:32:03.280 the app, open it again, and then um go
01:32:07.040 to the specific app that we are working
01:32:09.360 on. Um and you see that now because we
01:32:12.239 are authenticated, we're not seeing the
01:32:13.760 off page anymore. We're actually seeing
01:32:15.840 the homepage. So, let's actually do
01:32:18.880 something cool. I'm going to make a sign
01:32:21.040 out button just so we can also test
01:32:23.760 signing out before we actually start
01:32:25.520 building the the core part of the uh of
01:32:28.800 the habit tracker. So let's make that uh
01:32:31.280 I'm going to come to the O context.
01:32:32.960 That's the last thing we're going to do
01:32:34.239 here. We're going to create a function
01:32:36.719 for signing out. So I'm going to create
01:32:38.880 here sign
01:32:40.440 out. And this function it won't require
01:32:44.480 any arguments to it. And to be honest,
01:32:46.320 it will just return a promise void. So
01:32:49.199 I'm going to say
01:32:50.360 promise void. And the sign out function
01:32:54.239 is pretty self-explanatory in the sense
01:32:56.639 that we just create a sign out over
01:32:59.400 here. And it has to be
01:33:03.480 async and what we do is we literally
01:33:06.400 just await the account and we delete the
01:33:10.560 session. So we call delete session. Now
01:33:13.199 we have to specify what session we're
01:33:15.199 deleting. You can see here to log out
01:33:16.719 the user use current as the session ID
01:33:18.960 to delete. So I'll just put current over
01:33:21.520 here and it will delete the current
01:33:23.719 session. Also when that happens we want
01:33:26.960 to automatically change the value of
01:33:28.960 user to null because now the user isn't
01:33:31.120 logged in. So we'll just set that to
01:33:32.560 null. So I'll set user to
01:33:36.840 null. Now we only want to actually do
01:33:39.760 that if it's successful. So I'm going to
01:33:41.920 try over
01:33:44.679 here and I want to catch any
01:33:48.760 errors. Now I don't really care about
01:33:51.520 displaying any errors if the user fails.
01:33:54.080 So I'll just actually console log for
01:33:56.159 now. Uh the error message or actually
01:33:59.600 just the error in general if there's any
01:34:01.600 errors. Now I want to pass this sign out
01:34:04.080 as the last function here in the O
01:34:06.400 context provider and let's have access
01:34:09.120 to it on the homepage. So, I'm going to
01:34:11.360 do that by going to our homepage. We'll
01:34:14.080 go to tabs over here, and we'll go to
01:34:16.120 index.tsx. We have this basic things
01:34:18.480 that we made when we were uh in the
01:34:20.480 beginning of the tutorial. So, we're
01:34:22.080 going to actually start changing this a
01:34:23.760 bit. So, the first thing I want to do
01:34:25.679 here is I'm going to make that button
01:34:28.159 just for now. I'll just make that
01:34:29.600 button. Now, I want to get it from React
01:34:31.679 Native paper, right? And I want to say
01:34:35.960 sign out. I also want to make this
01:34:39.760 button I mean it's already mode text but
01:34:42.000 I want to specify that it's the mode
01:34:43.920 text. Now when we press this button I
01:34:47.840 want to call the sign out function. To
01:34:50.480 get that sign out function I need to
01:34:52.320 again call the use off
01:34:54.760 hook and get back here the sign out
01:34:59.239 function. Now let's see what happens
01:35:01.520 when I click on this button. Actually,
01:35:04.080 one thing I can do as well is that I can
01:35:05.440 set an icon to this and I can put log
01:35:07.760 out.
01:35:08.920 And you'll see that now it has this
01:35:11.360 little cool icon that represents logging
01:35:13.920 out. Now I'll click on this and you'll
01:35:17.040 see we are redirected to the off page
01:35:19.040 because we set the user to null and we
01:35:21.280 actually deleted the session. Now if I
01:35:23.199 put here Pedro Tech
01:35:25.480 Rumés and I put the password that I used
01:35:29.440 to sign in. Actually, let me put a a
01:35:31.760 wrong password. Let's see what what it
01:35:33.280 says. Yeah, it correctly detects that.
01:35:35.360 But if I'll I'll put the right one. Um H
01:35:38.880 interesting. It redirected me back to
01:35:40.400 the O page, which is weird. I mean, I
01:35:43.280 know I'm a so um I wonder why. So, if I
01:35:47.280 go back into the app, you'll see I
01:35:48.960 probably am already signed in. I don't
01:35:50.719 But it didn't redirect us to the
01:35:53.120 homepage automatically. So, there's an
01:35:54.960 issue here. And the issue probably is
01:35:56.960 with the um with the O context with the
01:36:02.320 sign-in functionality. Yeah. Uh with the
01:36:04.560 sign-in functionality, we want before we
01:36:07.199 actually uh return null down here, we
01:36:10.400 want to uh get the session, right? We
01:36:13.840 just created the session. Now we want to
01:36:15.600 get it. So I'm going to say await
01:36:19.480 account.get. And then from here I want
01:36:22.239 to set the user equal to the
01:36:27.960 session. So what happens now is if I
01:36:30.560 sign out and I come over here and I put
01:36:32.639 pedro tech
01:36:34.440 rumés
01:36:36.120 atgmail.com and I put the correct
01:36:39.480 password it should now take us to the
01:36:42.000 homepage. Perfect. I'll just save the
01:36:43.840 password so we don't have to keep
01:36:44.960 putting it. But perfect. Now we have
01:36:46.880 successfully fixed that issue. So, let's
01:36:48.880 start building this uh homepage. Let's
01:36:51.679 think about it. We want to create a
01:36:53.840 habit tracker. And to create a habit
01:36:56.000 tracker, we want to have different tabs
01:36:58.960 at the bottom that are going to
01:37:00.800 represent the different parts of our
01:37:02.159 app. So, we specifically have three
01:37:04.159 different parts of our app. We're going
01:37:05.679 to have the um add habit page like
01:37:09.760 screen. We're going to have the home
01:37:11.600 screen. And we're also going to have a
01:37:13.760 screen for us to see the streaks of the
01:37:15.840 habits that we've had consistently.
01:37:18.520 uh accomplished, right? So, we keep
01:37:21.040 track of all of the habits we are
01:37:22.639 completing every day and uh we keep
01:37:25.119 track of the best ones um in another
01:37:27.280 page. Now, to do that, we want to adapt
01:37:29.600 our tab navigator to actually match that
01:37:32.320 and also change a bit of the styling
01:37:34.000 because it doesn't match the styling
01:37:35.440 that we're using on React Native paper.
01:37:38.000 So, what I want to do is I'll actually
01:37:39.600 go to the layout over here. Not this
01:37:41.360 one. uh actually yeah this one cuz we
01:37:43.600 have the tabs here and I want to add
01:37:45.600 more uh stuff to this tabs screen
01:37:48.320 options which if you remember it's how
01:37:50.159 we style this tabs navigator. So the way
01:37:53.280 I'm going to do this is the first thing
01:37:54.960 is I want to set a header style and the
01:37:59.440 header style I'm going to apply apply is
01:38:02.080 I want to apply the background color of
01:38:04.400 the header. So what does this do? Well,
01:38:06.639 it's a way for us to actually change the
01:38:08.719 style of this header section over here,
01:38:11.920 uh, depending on the route you're in.
01:38:13.840 So, for example, if I set set the
01:38:15.960 background color to purple. I don't even
01:38:20.000 think that's Yeah, it is a color, but
01:38:21.280 yeah, it changes to a purple. Right now,
01:38:23.840 we want to actually set it to the the
01:38:26.480 kind of beige white color that we've
01:38:28.480 been using. So, I'll set it to F5. F5
01:38:30.840 F5. Then, I also want to apply a header
01:38:34.880 shadow visible. So header shadow visible
01:38:38.639 and I'll set it to false. So I remove
01:38:40.880 that actual line here. Then I'm going to
01:38:44.000 apply a tab bar style. And the tab bar
01:38:47.119 style will apply specifically for this
01:38:49.840 section over here. Now for the tab bar
01:38:52.320 style, I want to put the same background
01:38:54.000 color as the header. So we'll set that
01:38:56.400 and we'll change a little bit the color.
01:38:58.239 Then I want to put a border top width.
01:39:01.760 So that's just the width of the top and
01:39:03.280 I want to set it to zero. I want to set
01:39:04.880 the elevation to zero and I want to set
01:39:07.360 the shadow opacity to zero. You'll see
01:39:10.239 that all those changes basically removes
01:39:12.159 that line from the top. Now I also want
01:39:15.440 to change the color of the active and
01:39:18.080 the inactive um tab. Right? So the tab
01:39:22.480 bar act active tint color. So for
01:39:26.400 example, right now it's the home. Uh, we
01:39:28.400 want to set it equal to this color
01:39:33.960 hashtag6200E and it's a little bit
01:39:36.400 purple to to kind of match the buttons.
01:39:39.600 Now we'll do the same thing to the
01:39:41.760 inactive tint color. So I'll change this
01:39:44.360 to
01:39:46.040 inactive. And now this one is going to
01:39:48.800 be just a bunch of sixes. So 666 666.
01:39:53.280 Perfect. And now you can see that we can
01:39:55.040 switch between them and it looks a lot
01:39:57.119 better. Now I do want to change a little
01:39:59.040 bit the icons and um the names of each
01:40:01.679 of the tabs. Right, we have the home,
01:40:04.159 but this isn't going to be the home
01:40:05.600 screen. It's going to be the main habits
01:40:08.400 screen. If you remember from the demo,
01:40:10.159 we have a screen with a title called
01:40:12.960 today's habits. And that's what we're
01:40:14.719 going to have for the homepage. So the
01:40:16.560 index screen. So the way we're going to
01:40:18.719 do this is we're going to change the
01:40:19.840 title to today's habits.
01:40:23.679 and let's switch that. Now the tab bar
01:40:26.719 icon, what I want to do is I actually
01:40:28.719 want to use another icon and I don't
01:40:30.960 want to switch between focused and
01:40:32.639 unfocused like I was doing before. I
01:40:34.400 just want to keep one. And the icon I'm
01:40:36.639 going to be using is called
01:40:39.480 material community
01:40:42.440 icons. And the way we import it is we're
01:40:45.840 going to come here at the top and I'm
01:40:48.080 going to delete this. I'm going to
01:40:49.440 import the
01:40:50.760 material community
01:40:53.520 icons. This will actually be an we're
01:40:56.560 going to destructure this and I'm just
01:40:57.760 going to get it directly from the vector
01:40:59.719 icons. Now through this I want to put
01:41:02.800 the specify the icon I want. And the
01:41:05.840 icon I want here is since it's like a
01:41:07.679 daily thing, it's like you're showing
01:41:09.199 today's habits. I want to put a
01:41:10.480 calendar. So I'm going to put the icon
01:41:12.159 with the name calendar today. And it
01:41:16.320 gives us a little cool icon for today.
01:41:19.040 Now, obviously, it looks super small.
01:41:20.960 So, I'm going to put the size that
01:41:23.000 matches and the color that
01:41:26.920 matches. Now, size. I mean, we're
01:41:29.520 getting color already from this, but we
01:41:31.199 need to get the size as well, so it
01:41:32.719 adapts perfectly. And you can see that
01:41:34.400 the size of the icon now switches to
01:41:36.400 adapt the tab screen. Now, the second
01:41:38.239 thing we want is we want a screen for
01:41:41.119 the uh streaks. It's the one that's
01:41:43.360 going to go in the middle. We haven't
01:41:44.480 made that page yet. We're going to do it
01:41:45.920 in a second, but we'll just create this
01:41:47.520 the the screen first. So, I want to
01:41:49.679 change this to
01:41:51.080 streaks and we'll change the title to
01:41:55.800 streaks. Now, the icon is going to be a
01:41:59.239 chart
01:42:01.320 line and the rest should remain the
01:42:04.080 same. Now, it's not appearing because we
01:42:05.920 we again we don't have that screen yet,
01:42:08.159 but we're going to make the last one
01:42:09.679 which is going to be the add habit page.
01:42:12.400 So, we're going to say uh add habit and
01:42:16.560 we're going to change this to add habit.
01:42:20.400 And the icon here is going to be the
01:42:22.400 plus
01:42:25.800 circle. Perfect. Now, let's make the two
01:42:28.880 other pages for uh the the streak and
01:42:32.480 the ad habit just so we have that
01:42:34.000 already. I'm going to I'm going to reuse
01:42:35.600 this. So, I'm going to change this to
01:42:38.679 streaks. And I'll change this to streaks
01:42:41.920 page or streaks screen. And now we have
01:42:45.360 that. Uh oh, weird. Why did it Why did
01:42:48.639 it refresh like that? But yeah, I'll
01:42:50.239 create another page now. I'll actually
01:42:51.920 copy this. I'll paste it here. And we'll
01:42:54.239 make the add habit. And I'll change this
01:42:57.520 to add habit
01:43:00.679 screen. Perfect. Now you see we have
01:43:03.679 access to the um add habit and the
01:43:06.880 streaks screen. Now the tab only shows
01:43:09.280 the streaks. So I actually want to
01:43:11.360 figure out why. So I'm going to actually
01:43:13.199 refresh the app again. So let me pull
01:43:16.000 this up. Let me just close this. Open it
01:43:18.480 again. And um hopefully the tab the
01:43:21.360 bottom tab navigator will be updated.
01:43:23.199 Yeah, it is. Sometimes you just have to
01:43:24.719 do that. It's kind of annoying, but
01:43:26.400 whatever. So you can see we now have the
01:43:28.320 three different screens that we're going
01:43:29.920 to be using. Now, what I want to do is I
01:43:31.679 just want to finalize the last piece of
01:43:33.760 our layout over here cuz there's a
01:43:35.600 couple things that we haven't added yet.
01:43:36.880 So, one thing I like to do with every
01:43:38.480 app that I make is I like to add a safe
01:43:40.960 area provider. This will ensure that our
01:43:43.679 app's UI components avoid areas that
01:43:45.760 could be obstructed by things like the
01:43:47.920 device notches and status bar. So, it's
01:43:51.040 just a way for us to keep our screen um
01:43:54.480 keep our app adaptive to our screen in a
01:43:56.800 safe way. So the way I'm going to do
01:43:58.400 this is I'm going to put this around the
01:44:00.320 route card but also below the O
01:44:02.000 provider. And I'm going to put the safe
01:44:05.119 area
01:44:06.679 provider. I'm also going to uh put the
01:44:10.880 paper provider which is uh just a
01:44:12.800 provider we have to get from React
01:44:14.400 Native paper. Um I forgot to add it
01:44:16.560 before but we can put it around this
01:44:18.320 safe area provider. So paper provider
01:44:22.080 and I'll do it here as well. Perfect.
01:44:25.520 Now we're pretty much done with this.
01:44:26.960 I'll close it out and we can start
01:44:28.400 building our index page. So, here is
01:44:30.719 where we're going to show all of the
01:44:32.080 habits. But to have habits to show, we
01:44:34.719 have to create the ad habit page. And to
01:44:37.840 make the ad habit page, we have to have
01:44:40.000 our apprite databases set up. So, this
01:44:43.119 is the part where we actually start
01:44:44.800 setting up our database in our project.
01:44:46.800 We have set up o, but we don't have
01:44:48.480 setup databases. So, I'm going to come
01:44:50.560 here to the database section on appite
01:44:52.480 and I'm going to click on create
01:44:53.679 database. Inside of here, I want to give
01:44:55.920 a name to this database. I'm going to
01:44:57.440 call it the habits DB or something like
01:45:00.400 this. And we're going to click on
01:45:02.000 create. And it's going to create the
01:45:03.920 database for us. Now, we need to keep
01:45:06.239 track of this ID because this is going
01:45:08.320 to be used to connect to it. So, I'm
01:45:10.159 going to come here to
01:45:12.520 ourv and I'm going to create an expo
01:45:17.400 public apprite. Actually, I'll just call
01:45:19.679 it database or DB ID just like this. and
01:45:23.840 I'll just paste it down here. Now, let's
01:45:26.320 go back here and we want to create a
01:45:28.480 collection. Now, a collection is going
01:45:30.000 to be like a table, right? Uh inside of
01:45:32.400 this database. So, I'll click on create
01:45:34.000 collection and we want to create um the
01:45:36.719 first collection. I'll just create one
01:45:38.400 for now. Uh we're going to have two, but
01:45:40.320 the first one is just going to be the
01:45:41.440 habits collection. It's just going to
01:45:42.800 keep track of all the habits you're
01:45:44.159 trying to track. So, I'm going to click
01:45:45.760 on create. And it is going to give us
01:45:48.639 here the habits collection. And I need
01:45:50.880 to copy this ID as well. So, I'm going
01:45:53.199 to open up the VS Code, and we're going
01:45:56.159 to create the um variable for this. I'll
01:45:59.679 just actually copy this, paste it behind
01:46:02.080 here. I'll change this to the
01:46:05.639 habits
01:46:07.239 collection ID. And then I'll just copy
01:46:09.920 this and paste it here. Perfect. Now, we
01:46:14.080 need to create the attributes that are
01:46:16.000 going to exist in this table. Like I
01:46:18.560 mentioned, this is not a NoSQL table,
01:46:20.800 right? It's a relational database. So we
01:46:22.800 do have to define the structure of how
01:46:24.320 the data is going to come in. So we go
01:46:26.400 to the attributes tab and we click on
01:46:28.000 create attribute and we can choose
01:46:29.840 between uh what the data types are going
01:46:32.639 to be for the attribute. Now for this
01:46:35.119 table here are the attributes we want.
01:46:37.600 The first one is when you create a habit
01:46:39.679 you want to keep track of which user
01:46:41.040 created it. So we're going to create a
01:46:42.840 user ID uh field. Now the size I'm just
01:46:47.199 going to put it to a th00and. It doesn't
01:46:49.440 really matter. It's just the size of the
01:46:51.280 string. And since we chose string, uh we
01:46:53.679 could put a default value over here, but
01:46:55.280 I'm not going to put one. Uh and I'll
01:46:57.119 choose this field to be required. And
01:46:59.360 then I can click on create. It's just
01:47:01.119 going to say that we are storing now the
01:47:02.639 user ID as a string. Now I want to
01:47:05.199 create a new attribute and it's going to
01:47:06.719 be the title of the habit. So I'll
01:47:08.639 create a title and I'll put again a
01:47:11.280 th00and as the the length and I'll click
01:47:13.600 on required and I'll create. Now we're
01:47:16.400 going to do the same thing for a bunch
01:47:18.239 of other ones as well. So, I'll just run
01:47:20.480 through it. We're going to have a
01:47:21.600 description for each of the habits.
01:47:24.320 We're going to make it required. And
01:47:25.520 I'll click on create. Then I feel like
01:47:28.560 actually the next one is an integer, not
01:47:30.960 a string because we want to keep track
01:47:32.560 of the streak count, right? For each of
01:47:35.040 the habits. So, create a streak count.
01:47:37.920 Uh you can put a minimum or a maximum
01:47:40.000 size. I'll put a minimum of zero because
01:47:41.760 obviously you can go negative on streak
01:47:44.159 counts. And I won't put a default value,
01:47:46.639 but I'll make it required. and I'll
01:47:48.159 click create. Now, we want to have
01:47:51.119 another string just to keep track of
01:47:53.440 when the user last completed their this
01:47:57.440 habit. And I'll put a th00and again and
01:47:59.840 I'll make it required. And then finally,
01:48:02.880 I want to actually there's two more. I
01:48:04.800 want to keep track of the frequency. So,
01:48:07.119 the frequency of like how many times
01:48:11.280 like how often you want to complete this
01:48:12.880 habit, right? Some habits can be
01:48:14.159 something for every day and some habits
01:48:15.840 can be an every week type thing. So
01:48:17.840 we're going to make this into an option.
01:48:19.679 I'll make it required. And the last one
01:48:22.400 is just the date in which this habit was
01:48:24.880 created. So I'm going to create a
01:48:26.719 created at field again a th00and. And
01:48:30.400 I'm going to make it
01:48:31.880 require. Perfect. And now we have the
01:48:34.400 table that we're going to be using for
01:48:36.159 this project. Now to use this table,
01:48:38.560 we're going to go back to our code over
01:48:40.080 here. And what I want to do is I want to
01:48:43.360 connect um the database ID that we have
01:48:47.040 to our actual database. So we'll go to
01:48:48.840 appite.ts over here and we'll create a
01:48:51.760 new access point to another service from
01:48:55.119 apprite. The service is going to be the
01:48:57.960 databases service. We'll also pass the
01:49:00.800 client, but we'll call this databases.
01:49:03.840 Now, we're going to create a variable
01:49:06.239 for each of the environment variables
01:49:08.080 that we have over here, cuz we're going
01:49:09.360 to have to constantly be calling them.
01:49:11.199 So, this one and this one. Uh, what
01:49:13.440 we're going to do is we're going to
01:49:14.719 create here a
01:49:17.400 database
01:49:18.920 ID variable. We're going to set it equal
01:49:21.679 to
01:49:23.560 process
01:49:26.600 env. And remember to make it um to
01:49:30.000 actually assure the type. And then we're
01:49:32.320 going to make the same thing but for the
01:49:34.320 habits collection ID. So habits
01:49:37.480 collection
01:49:39.639 ID and we'll copy as well the value from
01:49:43.520 the NV uh not the value but the the
01:49:46.719 variable and we'll put it over here.
01:49:49.119 Perfect. Now we'll export this so that
01:49:51.840 we have access to it in different parts
01:49:53.760 of our app.
01:49:55.600 Now I'll save this and let's go to the
01:49:59.840 add habit page. So we can first create
01:50:02.639 the ability to add a habit so that we
01:50:04.320 can then see it on the today's habit
01:50:06.480 screen. So let's start like always with
01:50:08.800 the UI of this screen. Let's think about
01:50:10.880 what we want here. Well, we already have
01:50:12.560 a view, right? But we also want to have
01:50:14.880 uh similar to the login page. We want to
01:50:16.400 have an input for adding the title. We
01:50:18.960 want to have an input for the
01:50:20.239 description. And we want to have a
01:50:21.840 button to add the habit. uh and also we
01:50:24.560 want to have a place for us to choose
01:50:26.320 whether this habit is something that you
01:50:28.400 want to do daily, something that you
01:50:29.760 want to do weekly or monthly. So I'm
01:50:32.639 going to create here first the inputs.
01:50:34.480 We're going to create a text input from
01:50:36.000 React Native paper and we're going to
01:50:38.320 put a label. The label for the first one
01:50:41.119 is going to be title. Then we'll put a
01:50:44.880 mode and the mode for it is going to be
01:50:47.199 outlined.
01:50:49.360 Now I'll do the exact same thing, but
01:50:51.119 we're going to do it for the
01:50:54.600 description. And then I want to create
01:50:58.239 the part where we actually can choose
01:51:00.320 between the different types of
01:51:02.400 frequencies. Right now, to do that,
01:51:04.639 there's a couple ways of doing it. What
01:51:06.320 I like to do is I like to use segmented
01:51:09.360 buttons. So segmented buttons, it's
01:51:12.239 going to basically make uh a sequence of
01:51:14.719 buttons like we we just described and
01:51:17.520 they're going to be right next to each
01:51:18.880 other. So I'm going to create here a
01:51:20.800 segmented buttons and we can pass a
01:51:23.040 value here for buttons. It's basically a
01:51:25.440 list of different buttons that we're
01:51:26.880 going to have. Now to pass this, we have
01:51:29.600 to pass a list of buttons that look like
01:51:32.239 this, right? It looks like it has a
01:51:34.520 value and it has a label.
01:51:38.800 Now the value of the first button is
01:51:41.840 going to be for example daily or
01:51:44.560 something like this and the label might
01:51:46.480 be daily as well. Now you see now we
01:51:49.440 have one button for the daily option.
01:51:52.239 Now if I copy this and paste it again
01:51:54.400 you see now we have two buttons. This is
01:51:56.159 what this does. Now a way for us to make
01:51:57.760 this actually easier is we can just
01:52:00.320 create uh above here probably a list
01:52:03.440 called
01:52:06.040 frequencies. and we'll set it equal to a
01:52:08.080 list and we'll have the options
01:52:10.840 daily,
01:52:12.520 weekly and
01:52:15.400 monthly. And then we can just loop
01:52:18.560 through uh this list like this
01:52:21.520 frequencies map. And while looping
01:52:24.080 through it, we can get the specific
01:52:27.000 frequency and just set the object equal
01:52:30.239 to the value which is the frequency and
01:52:35.119 the label which is going to be the
01:52:38.599 frequency but actually what I want to do
01:52:41.119 with it is I don't want it see it will
01:52:42.880 say daily, weekly, monthly. I want to
01:52:44.239 capitalize the first letter. The way I'm
01:52:46.080 going to do this is I'm going to get the
01:52:47.520 first item. So we'll say char at
01:52:50.000 position zero which is the first letter
01:52:53.040 but instead of just rendering that I
01:52:54.800 want to uppercase that. So you see it
01:52:57.599 now becomes uppercase and then I want to
01:52:59.679 add to the end of this string basically
01:53:02.239 the rest of the string. And to do that I
01:53:04.159 just slice the string starting at the
01:53:06.560 second letter and now I capitalize just
01:53:08.400 the first letter. Perfect. Now we have
01:53:11.520 our least list of uh segmented buttons.
01:53:14.560 But uh it's giving us an error just
01:53:16.239 because we we need to pass a couple
01:53:18.080 other things like what happens when you
01:53:20.320 change on it and so on. But we'll keep
01:53:22.080 it as that for now. We're also going to
01:53:23.760 wrap this around with a view just cuz we
01:53:26.159 want to style this in a very specific
01:53:28.560 way.
01:53:30.119 Then below this we want to put the
01:53:32.560 button and the button is going to be the
01:53:36.800 add habit button. And I'm going to pass
01:53:39.920 the mode as
01:53:43.400 contained. And why is giving us an
01:53:46.000 error? We have to import button from
01:53:48.239 react native
01:53:49.480 paper. Perfect. And I'll go to add
01:53:51.599 habit. And now we have the button here.
01:53:54.000 Perfect. Now let's add the styles for
01:53:56.400 this. I'll first add the style name. So
01:53:58.880 we'll have here a style for the view.
01:54:00.880 We're going to call this
01:54:03.880 styles.container. We also haven't
01:54:05.520 created that yet. We can create it down
01:54:07.199 here at the bottom actually. So I'll say
01:54:09.440 styles is equal to
01:54:13.480 stylesheet. Uh I'll actually let me
01:54:16.320 import it from React Native
01:54:18.080 automatically. Yeah. And then I'm going
01:54:20.400 to say
01:54:21.400 docreate and we'll just keep like this
01:54:24.480 for now. But we'll create a container
01:54:26.400 style. We're also going to create an
01:54:28.639 input style that we're going to apply to
01:54:30.480 both
01:54:32.280 inputs. And then we want one for this
01:54:35.840 view. So I'm going to call it the
01:54:39.159 frequency
01:54:41.800 container. And we'll do one for the
01:54:44.159 segmented uh buttons as well. So I'll
01:54:46.880 apply here style is equal to uh actually
01:54:50.560 I'll just paste this. So I'll say
01:54:53.159 segmented
01:54:54.840 buttons. And finally, let's do it for
01:54:58.000 the add habit button. So, we'll just
01:55:01.440 call this button. And now, let's apply
01:55:04.000 this. Let's create the styles directly
01:55:05.920 down here. The first one is the
01:55:07.360 container. And what we want to do with
01:55:08.960 the container is we want to uh first set
01:55:13.440 the flex to one, which you'll see will
01:55:16.400 do nothing for now, but when we add the
01:55:18.320 padding to 16, uh it will kind of
01:55:21.360 declutter stuff. We also want to set the
01:55:23.520 background uh to this screen to be the
01:55:27.040 color that we're using for everything.
01:55:28.560 So we'll say F5 F5 F5. Uh then we
01:55:32.960 actually have to set background color
01:55:34.960 not
01:55:35.719 background. And then we can stop with
01:55:38.800 the container. We'll give some styling
01:55:40.719 for the
01:55:41.880 input. Now for the input, we want to
01:55:44.400 just set a margin bottom of
01:55:47.960 16 to give some space. Then we'll do the
01:55:51.920 same thing but for the frequency
01:55:54.199 container. So we'll do
01:55:56.679 frequency
01:55:58.199 container. Now for the frequency
01:56:00.080 container, let's just make a bigger
01:56:01.599 margin bottom. Uh no, not this 24.
01:56:05.360 That's what I meant. Now we'll copy
01:56:08.719 again. We'll paste it here. And we'll
01:56:11.280 make this segmented buttons style. Now
01:56:15.520 this one will be similar to the input.
01:56:17.440 We'll just put some margin down here.
01:56:19.440 And finally, we want to create the
01:56:21.040 button to have a margin
01:56:25.080 top a margin top of eight. Perfect. But
01:56:29.920 I'm going to be honest. I think I think
01:56:31.520 this looks too big. I'm going to
01:56:34.159 actually make this eight. And I want to
01:56:36.639 make
01:56:37.639 this I think this is fine. Yeah,
01:56:40.080 actually. Let me even remove the styling
01:56:42.000 for this. I don't think we need it.
01:56:44.920 Uh this is for the Did I remove? Yeah, I
01:56:48.560 removed for both the segmented buttons
01:56:50.400 and for the button. Yeah, this is fine.
01:56:52.880 React Native paper adds a lot of styling
01:56:54.800 automatically, which is great for us.
01:56:57.040 And we now have this at the top here.
01:56:59.679 Now, I could also, if I wanted to, just
01:57:02.960 justify the content to be center. Uh,
01:57:06.400 and then everything is centered. Uh, you
01:57:08.480 can do that if you want to. Uh, I
01:57:10.400 actually might keep it like this just
01:57:12.080 because I like the style of this. Um, I
01:57:14.800 also set the margin bottom here to eight
01:57:16.800 just so I can make it not not this one.
01:57:18.960 Uh, I kind of wanted to just set the
01:57:21.679 Actually, I'll remove the margin bottom
01:57:23.840 here. And actually, I'll keep it like
01:57:25.360 this. It just makes it easier for us to
01:57:27.119 see it. And I think this should be good
01:57:29.920 to go. Now, let's add the logic to keep
01:57:32.880 track of what the user is typing. Uh, we
01:57:35.440 want to keep track of this title, the
01:57:37.199 description, and the the frequency,
01:57:39.520 right? So, to do that, we're going to
01:57:41.119 use states.
01:57:43.280 So I'll come over here. I'll create here
01:57:45.599 the title
01:57:47.400 state which will be a
01:57:51.159 string and we'll start as as an empty
01:57:54.000 string. Then I'll just copy this. I'll
01:57:56.239 paste it three
01:57:57.800 times. And I'm going to change this to
01:58:00.760 description. I'm going to change this to
01:58:03.280 set
01:58:04.679 description. And the final one is going
01:58:06.880 to be a frequency. I'm going to change
01:58:08.719 this to frequency. And I'll change this
01:58:11.920 to set frequency as well.
01:58:15.320 Now the type of this is let's actually
01:58:18.159 make a type out of this array. So what
01:58:21.440 I'm going to make is I'm going to create
01:58:22.480 a type called
01:58:23.960 frequency. And the type of it is
01:58:26.560 actually going to be an object with the
01:58:29.280 type of and then I'll put the trip
01:58:31.760 frequencies array. I can do this in
01:58:34.560 Typescript. I'm just making the key be
01:58:36.719 one of these options and then it will
01:58:39.599 have uh as a value a number. So I'll put
01:58:43.440 here the type of frequency to be
01:58:45.480 frequency and initially it will be
01:58:49.480 daily. That actually makes sense. If we
01:58:51.760 go back here to our thing, let's
01:58:54.320 actually set the initial frequency on
01:58:56.719 this attribute to be daily. I think that
01:59:00.080 that might be a good thing for us to do.
01:59:02.880 Uh, I'll set it to daily. Now, we go
01:59:06.719 here to all of our inputs,
01:59:24.520 especi. Now, the frequency is going to
01:59:27.119 be a little bit different. We're not
01:59:28.320 going to use an onchange text. we're
01:59:30.639 actually going to have to use an onv
01:59:32.000 value change because that's what
01:59:33.280 segmented buttons allow us to. And when
01:59:35.679 there's a change in the button you
01:59:37.040 click, we're going to have this callback
01:59:38.880 function and we can access the value. So
01:59:41.840 this this property over here of the
01:59:43.920 button we clicked. Now what we want to
01:59:46.000 do is we want to set the frequency equal
01:59:48.480 to the value as frequency. Now we also
01:59:52.800 have to put a value as the initial
01:59:54.639 frequency selected. So we're going to
01:59:56.880 set value over here equal to frequency.
01:59:59.599 And that's why the thing was red
02:00:02.080 squiggly lined because now we can select
02:00:04.480 daily as the first value and I can
02:00:06.320 switch between them. And you can see
02:00:07.599 that there is some styling to which
02:00:09.760 segmented button you click. Now on the
02:00:11.920 add habit button I want to uh where we
02:00:14.639 have the mode contained. Obviously we're
02:00:16.639 going to put an on press for when you
02:00:18.080 submit it but also I want to disable
02:00:20.000 this button if there's no title or no
02:00:24.639 description. So the user can't even
02:00:26.800 select it if they haven't written
02:00:28.960 anything yet. Now I think it's time for
02:00:31.040 us to handle what happens when you add a
02:00:33.360 habit and successfully add stuff to our
02:00:35.440 database. So to do that I'm going to add
02:00:37.760 an on press over here and we're going to
02:00:39.440 call this function called handle submit.
02:00:42.480 Now we have to create that function.
02:00:44.080 We're going to do it up here. We're
02:00:45.679 going to say const handle
02:00:48.040 submit. We have to make this into an
02:00:50.320 async function just cuz we're going to
02:00:52.560 be accessing database stuff and I want
02:00:55.599 to only be able to add I want to make
02:00:57.599 sure that the user exists before we
02:01:00.560 actually submit this. So I'm going to
02:01:02.800 create here a user and set it equal to
02:01:05.040 use o.
02:01:07.119 And if the user doesn't exist, then
02:01:11.679 we'll just skip this function just so we
02:01:13.679 can assure that the user exists when
02:01:15.599 we're trying to add a habit because
02:01:17.599 we're going to access information about
02:01:18.880 the user, especially the user ID. Now,
02:01:21.760 inside of here, here is how we're going
02:01:23.920 to handle um adding a user or adding a
02:01:27.360 habit. So we need to
02:01:30.599 await and we will call the databases
02:01:33.119 object that we we created in our apprite
02:01:36.239 file and I have to click on create
02:01:39.040 document. Create document will add
02:01:41.280 something to a collection. It will add a
02:01:42.960 document to a collection and a document
02:01:44.960 will just be an entry to our table. Now
02:01:47.920 to create a document I need to pass a
02:01:49.920 database ID. I need to pass a habits
02:01:53.280 collection ID and I need to pass the id
02:01:57.280 of the um document I'm creating which if
02:02:00.159 you remember I could easily create by
02:02:01.760 using the ID do unique uh but I need to
02:02:04.960 import this id object from react native
02:02:08.239 apprite and then use the unique
02:02:10.760 function. Now after we're done doing
02:02:13.280 that we can now pass an object that
02:02:15.440 represents the attribute structure of
02:02:17.840 this um document that we're creating. So
02:02:20.639 if you remember the first thing we need
02:02:22.080 to pass is a user ID and we'll get that
02:02:25.840 by saying user dot and then we'll get
02:02:28.560 the id. User if you remember is the uh
02:02:32.080 session that we have from the use
02:02:34.280 off. Now the second thing is the title.
02:02:37.280 Obviously we get the title from the
02:02:39.119 states that we created to keep track of
02:02:40.880 this. So we'll just pass title. We'll
02:02:42.800 pass description as well. Same thing.
02:02:45.440 Then frequency. Same thing. But then
02:02:48.400 there's a couple other things. For
02:02:49.840 example, with the streak count, we'll
02:02:51.280 start it as zero. So, we'll have to pass
02:02:54.239 it as zero over
02:02:55.560 here. Then we want to pass a last
02:03:00.760 completed. And the last completed by
02:03:03.119 default is going to be today. So, we'll
02:03:05.119 say new
02:03:07.639 date dot to ISO string. And this will
02:03:11.679 basically create the current date. We'll
02:03:14.239 do the exact same thing uh also put the
02:03:16.560 date but for the created at property.
02:03:20.880 And now we have the structure of our
02:03:22.679 object. When we click this, it should
02:03:25.280 actually send this as a document to our
02:03:27.760 table. But when we successfully create a
02:03:30.159 new habit, what I also want to do is I
02:03:32.000 want to be able to go back to where we
02:03:33.760 were before because we created a habit.
02:03:36.000 Now we actually can see the habit
02:03:37.599 appearing in the screen. So I'm going to
02:03:38.960 click on
02:03:40.440 router.back. And uh this should navigate
02:03:43.280 you back to where you were before. Now
02:03:45.199 obviously we don't have access to the
02:03:47.199 router here. So let's do that. Con
02:03:49.760 router is equal to use
02:03:52.040 router from expert router. And that will
02:03:56.000 navigate us back. But this might fail.
02:03:58.800 So let's try catch this. So we'll say
02:04:02.760 try and we're going to catch any
02:04:06.119 errors. And in here we might want to
02:04:10.400 handle errors. So I'm going to actually
02:04:12.320 create here an error state. So error and
02:04:16.080 set error and this is going to be a
02:04:19.040 state that is a
02:04:21.239 string and when there is an error we
02:04:24.880 have to check if error is instance of
02:04:31.360 error right we've done this before then
02:04:33.920 we set the error to be equal to error
02:04:36.719 dom message because then we know there's
02:04:38.400 a message in that error object but if
02:04:41.040 not
02:04:42.960 uh like and we want to return this as
02:04:44.960 well. If not, then we'll just set the
02:04:47.760 error to some generic thing like there
02:04:50.360 was an error creating the
02:04:54.920 habit. Perfect. And now let's handle
02:04:58.560 displaying that error when creating a
02:05:00.159 habit. We'll put it below the button.
02:05:01.679 We'll add here u if there's an
02:05:04.840 error. So if error is true, then we'll
02:05:10.320 do the exact same thing we did here on
02:05:12.080 the off page. which will actually even
02:05:13.760 copy the logic we did there. We'll just
02:05:16.320 copy this. We'll put it
02:05:18.920 here. And uh we need now have access to
02:05:22.719 the theme similar to what we did there.
02:05:24.800 So we'll have to um call the use theme
02:05:28.000 hook from React Native paper. So use
02:05:30.080 theme just so we can get the color
02:05:32.000 remember. Uh
02:05:35.480 and what happened here?
02:05:40.000 Oh, we need to import the text from uh
02:05:43.920 from React Native paper, not from React
02:05:46.159 Native. Right. So, we'll just import
02:05:49.280 text over here. And now the error should
02:05:52.239 be gone. Perfect. Now, let's try
02:05:54.239 creating a a habit and let's see what
02:05:56.719 happens. Let's put here uh let's think
02:05:59.760 of one that I can do every day. uh
02:06:03.400 meditate for that's the title and then I
02:06:05.920 put five
02:06:07.800 minutes of
02:06:10.760 meditation
02:06:12.280 every morning and we choose it to be
02:06:15.199 daily and we click on add habit. It says
02:06:18.960 current user is not authorized to
02:06:20.639 perform the requested action meaning
02:06:22.400 that we are displaying the error
02:06:23.679 correctly. But you might be wondering
02:06:25.119 why why am I not authorized? Well,
02:06:27.360 because if you've ever worked with any
02:06:29.280 uh backend as a service such as
02:06:31.040 Superbase or uh Firebase or in this case
02:06:33.840 Apprite, you know that you need to set
02:06:35.520 up policies for which users are
02:06:37.920 authorized to execute actions on your
02:06:41.199 tables. So the way we do that is we go
02:06:43.440 to settings over here and we go down and
02:06:45.599 we see permissions, right? You can
02:06:47.679 choose who can access the collection and
02:06:49.360 documents. So, we need to add a role for
02:06:52.480 this collection. And by default, no one
02:06:55.119 can do anything with this collection,
02:06:56.800 which is good because it secures our
02:06:58.639 collection. So, I'm need to click here,
02:07:00.560 add a role to get started. And I need to
02:07:03.520 choose what role I want to apply. Now,
02:07:05.840 I'm going to choose all users over here.
02:07:08.000 And I want to allow all users to create,
02:07:09.840 read, update, and delete. And to be
02:07:11.520 honest, because this app is very
02:07:12.800 personal in the sense that you don't
02:07:14.480 interact with habits from other people,
02:07:16.960 I think that you can basically set the
02:07:19.199 user to be able to do anything they want
02:07:21.440 um in this table. So, we're going to
02:07:23.360 allow users, not guest users, so users
02:07:26.239 of the app, people authenticated to be
02:07:28.320 able to create, read, update, and delete
02:07:30.320 their own habits. And I'll click update.
02:07:32.719 And now we should see that if I go back
02:07:35.360 into our app and I click add habit, we
02:07:39.520 have successfully added a habit. Now,
02:07:41.360 how do I know that? Well, the
02:07:43.560 router.back here redirected us back to
02:07:46.159 today's habits. Meaning that if I go to
02:07:48.320 our database over here, we should see
02:07:50.800 that there was a document that was
02:07:52.960 created and it looks exactly like what
02:07:55.119 we just created. Great. We have
02:07:57.360 successfully connected our React Native
02:07:59.040 app to our backend. But now, how do I
02:08:02.480 display the habits on the today's habits
02:08:04.880 screen? So, I'm going to close. Now,
02:08:07.040 we're done with the add habits. We'll go
02:08:08.639 to the index screen and we're going to
02:08:11.199 create the today's habits page. So, in
02:08:14.320 here, I want to start by being able to
02:08:17.119 fetch the list of habits that we have on
02:08:19.280 the table. So, to do that, I'm going to
02:08:21.840 create here a function called fetch
02:08:24.360 habits. It's going to be an async
02:08:26.560 function. And inside of here, I want to
02:08:30.719 try and catch uh getting the habit. So,
02:08:34.159 I'm going to catch an
02:08:35.960 error. And to be honest, if there's an
02:08:38.159 error, I don't want to display anything.
02:08:40.320 I just want to console error the
02:08:44.440 error. Now, when I fetch the habits, I
02:08:48.079 need to use the same logic we used with
02:08:52.000 the um creating habits. We need to
02:08:54.239 access the databases object. So I'm
02:08:56.719 going to await databases and we need to
02:09:00.560 import that from the apprite file. Now
02:09:03.520 for fetching documents in a in a in a
02:09:06.320 collection we use the list documents
02:09:08.480 function. Now this function will list
02:09:10.719 all the documents in this um collection
02:09:14.719 um as per you put a condition for those
02:09:17.520 documents to appear and the condition we
02:09:19.280 want is we only want to list the
02:09:20.800 documents that are created by the user
02:09:23.360 that is logged in right now. So they
02:09:24.719 only see their own habits. So what we
02:09:26.880 put here is first we need to put the
02:09:28.560 database ID then we need to put the
02:09:31.360 habits collection ID and then finally
02:09:34.800 you need to put the condition. So you
02:09:37.520 might already be understand that every
02:09:39.840 time you interact with a database or a
02:09:41.679 collection you have to pass the database
02:09:43.360 ID and the specific collection ID. So
02:09:45.280 that's why we created those variables
02:09:46.560 and exported them. Now the condition it
02:09:49.360 looks a bit weird but you'll get used to
02:09:50.800 it. You need to pass an array because
02:09:52.880 you can actually implement multiple
02:09:54.480 conditions. In our case, we're only
02:09:55.599 going to have one condition, which is
02:09:57.679 just that we only want to list the
02:09:59.280 documents in which the user ID is equal
02:10:01.360 to the ID of the user who's logged in.
02:10:03.679 So to do that, we have to get the user
02:10:06.000 that is logged in through the use O. And
02:10:09.360 we're going to create here a query. Now
02:10:12.480 this query we we'll we can specify what
02:10:15.920 comparison are we making here, right? It
02:10:17.760 can be uh a between, a contains, a
02:10:20.960 greater than or equal, stuff like that.
02:10:22.719 We want it to be equal. We want the user
02:10:24.480 ID field to equal the ID of the user
02:10:26.960 logged in. So we put equal. We specify
02:10:30.239 the field we're putting this comparison
02:10:32.239 on. So user ID and we specify what uh we
02:10:36.560 are comparing it to. So we're comparing
02:10:38.560 it to the user ID. Now this could be
02:10:41.760 null. So if it is null because the user
02:10:44.239 isn't logged in for some reason, we just
02:10:46.239 put this which is an empty string. And
02:10:48.239 then obviously there's no habits with an
02:10:50.239 empty string. So it won't return
02:10:52.239 anything. Anyways, now when this is
02:10:54.239 done, we want to basically keep track of
02:10:57.040 this response. So I'm going to create
02:10:58.800 here a state called um habits. And this
02:11:03.599 state will be a list of habits which is
02:11:07.760 going to have a type called habit list.
02:11:11.440 Now we have we don't have the type yet.
02:11:13.360 We need to create it. And what I like to
02:11:15.360 do on my React Native app is I like to
02:11:17.679 create a types um folder. So I'll create
02:11:21.840 here types. And in here I'll create all
02:11:25.199 the specific types that we need to be
02:11:27.599 reusing on our project. And habit is a
02:11:29.599 type that we're going to reuse it
02:11:30.800 multiple times. So I'll create here a
02:11:33.199 file called
02:11:38.199 database.type.ts. And in here I'll
02:11:40.079 create all the types including this
02:11:41.840 habit one. So in here we're going to
02:11:44.760 export an interface called habit. And
02:11:49.840 this interface is actually going to
02:11:52.920 extend another interface which is
02:11:55.679 something we can get from appite. It's
02:11:58.159 going to be called models.doccument. But
02:12:00.560 we need to import models. So models
02:12:03.360 do.cument. Why? because now the habit uh
02:12:07.280 interface is going to include the
02:12:09.320 specific format of attributes that we're
02:12:12.079 going to set but also it is going to
02:12:14.639 include extra stuff that a normal
02:12:17.199 document that we get back from eprite
02:12:19.679 might include as well. So the way we do
02:12:21.920 this is we specify here for example a
02:12:24.000 habit has a user ID which is a string.
02:12:27.679 It has a title which is a string. A
02:12:30.440 description which is a string. It also
02:12:33.599 has a
02:12:35.079 frequency which is a string. Uh streak
02:12:40.679 count which is a number not a string.
02:12:43.199 It's the only one that isn't a string.
02:12:44.880 And a less completed which is a string.
02:12:47.440 and a created at which is a string.
02:12:52.400 Perfect. And now we can use this habit
02:12:56.320 as a type over here by importing the
02:12:59.040 type from database type. Now when we
02:13:02.159 create the response, I want to set the
02:13:04.239 habits equal to the response. But the
02:13:06.880 response will return back more than just
02:13:08.480 the list of habits. To get that, I
02:13:10.719 actually have to say response documents.
02:13:13.760 And I want to cast the type of it to be
02:13:16.320 equal to a habit list so that we
02:13:18.639 specifically know what the type is. Now
02:13:21.440 before we list that out, I want to
02:13:22.960 console log it just so we see if we're
02:13:24.800 actually getting back the response
02:13:26.800 documents. Let's see what we get back
02:13:28.480 from that. So let's run this fetch
02:13:32.079 habits function every time the user
02:13:34.239 comes to this screen. So I'm going to
02:13:35.440 create a use effect and on this use
02:13:37.199 effect we're going to pass a dependency
02:13:38.719 array which is just going to be the user
02:13:40.639 just in case the user changes. And in
02:13:42.800 here I want to call the fetch habits
02:13:44.599 function. Now if I open my terminal over
02:13:48.480 here you see that we have a console log
02:13:51.119 and it includes the information for the
02:13:54.079 one uh frequency or the number one habit
02:13:57.360 that we created right it includes here
02:13:58.800 the user ID uh it includes the
02:14:00.960 description the title and the frequency
02:14:04.400 and so on. So we are getting back the
02:14:06.560 data correctly. Uh and we're also
02:14:08.400 setting it to the state. So now we can
02:14:10.159 actually start building the UI to adapt
02:14:12.639 to that state. So how are we going to do
02:14:14.320 this? Well, I'm going to delete this
02:14:15.920 stuff over here. Let's start from a
02:14:17.599 clean slate. Now in this uh view over
02:14:20.800 here, I actually want to start by making
02:14:23.119 kind of like a header to this page. So
02:14:25.280 I'm going to make another view which is
02:14:27.199 going to be the header. And on this one,
02:14:28.960 we're going to have a text that I'm
02:14:30.880 going to import uh I hope it imported
02:14:34.400 from No, it's not from React Native. I
02:14:37.040 want to import it from React Native
02:14:40.520 paper. And then I want this text to be
02:14:45.360 saying today's
02:14:47.960 habits. Perfect. Now I want to put a
02:14:50.960 variant to this. The variant is going to
02:14:53.040 be headline
02:14:55.159 small. And then I want to put a button
02:14:58.079 in here on the header which is going to
02:15:00.000 be the logout button which I just
02:15:02.000 realized we deleted. So, let me sorry,
02:15:04.079 let me command Z everything here cuz I
02:15:06.719 want to get back this button. And then
02:15:09.199 I'll just command shift Z. So, we go
02:15:12.239 back to where we were. And then I'll put
02:15:13.920 the button below this. Uh, but we need
02:15:16.880 to import this from React Native paper.
02:15:19.360 Perfect. Now, we have this button over
02:15:20.880 here. Now, this is going to be the
02:15:22.079 header. So, below this header, we want
02:15:24.400 to have the list of habits. So we want
02:15:27.360 to first check to see if there's no
02:15:28.719 habits because if the habits list so if
02:15:32.560 the habits.length length is equal to
02:15:35.880 zero. Then I want to display a view over
02:15:41.480 here that is going to have just a text
02:15:46.079 saying that the habits is u empty.
02:15:49.360 Right? So I'm going to say no habits
02:15:53.239 yet. Add your first habit.
02:15:58.639 Now, if that's not true, which we know
02:16:00.800 it isn't, uh then we display the list of
02:16:03.520 habits. And to do that, we have to loop
02:16:06.560 through the habits array. So, we'll say
02:16:08.079 habits.m map and we'll map through each
02:16:10.560 of them. Grab the individual habit and a
02:16:14.800 key over
02:16:16.199 here. And we're going to create a view
02:16:20.320 for this habit. So, we'll make here a
02:16:23.960 view. And for now we won't do anything
02:16:26.800 with it but we'll just create it. Now
02:16:30.560 obviously habits is not empty so we are
02:16:32.558 not seeing this text but if this was the
02:16:35.040 opposite you'll see that we would see
02:16:36.799 this no habits yet add your first habit.
02:16:39.679 Uh but we want to keep obviously uh
02:16:42.398 habit like this. So now let's create the
02:16:45.040 habit in individual habit view. So for
02:16:47.359 this we want to display some information
02:16:48.879 about the habit. The first one is we
02:16:50.959 want to put a text. Now, this text is
02:16:53.519 going to be the title, right? So, we're
02:16:55.840 going to put here the
02:16:58.318 um
02:17:01.398 habit.title. Also, let me just put a key
02:17:04.080 to this uh view so we can properly index
02:17:07.799 this. Now, we're showing the title of
02:17:10.080 the habit. Now, we'll do the same thing
02:17:11.679 for the description. So, we'll show
02:17:14.040 description and then I think I want to
02:17:16.318 create a view now so we can display the
02:17:20.000 um the streak. So, I'm going to create a
02:17:22.398 view. I'm going to close that view. And
02:17:25.120 in here, we're going to create another
02:17:28.760 view. And we'll close that other view.
02:17:32.000 And inside of this other view, I want to
02:17:33.920 put an icon. I'm going to put
02:17:37.558 material community icons, similar to
02:17:40.160 what we did before. And on this icon, I
02:17:43.120 want to use the icon with the name fire.
02:17:46.000 It's kind of like a fire emoji. And
02:17:49.200 that's to represent the the the
02:17:51.359 individual streaks. I'm going to put a
02:17:53.120 size of it to be a little bit bigger.
02:17:54.398 I'm going to make it 18. And I also want
02:17:56.478 to put the color to be um this color
02:18:00.318 over here. It's a hashtag um
02:18:05.160 FF9800. And it will be kind of orange.
02:18:08.519 Perfect. Now I want to put a text with
02:18:12.318 the actual streak of this habit. So, I'm
02:18:16.160 going to put a text right next to this
02:18:18.558 icon and it's going to include the habit
02:18:21.599 dot streak count. And I'll put right
02:18:24.240 next to it, obviously, it's zero by
02:18:25.679 default, but I'm going to put day
02:18:29.558 streak. Nice. Now, below this, I want to
02:18:33.840 put the frequency, right? So, below the
02:18:36.558 view that we just closed, I want to put
02:18:39.359 another view. And this will be the
02:18:40.959 frequency uh badge, the frequency view.
02:18:44.240 And in here, I'll just put a text that
02:18:46.398 says the habit
02:18:51.160 frequency dot char at zero. Similar to
02:18:55.120 what we did before to capitalize, we're
02:18:57.439 going to uppercase
02:18:58.920 it plus the habit frequency dots
02:19:03.638 slice starting from one. And uh I need
02:19:07.280 to close this. Sorry. Yeah. And now we
02:19:10.000 get the frequency with a capitalized
02:19:12.160 first letter. So we see daily. Now
02:19:14.160 obviously the styling of this looks
02:19:15.760 really ugly. Uh so we do need to apply
02:19:17.840 some styling to it. So I'll do what we
02:19:19.599 did last time. I'll just add the uh
02:19:22.160 individual elements first and then I'll
02:19:24.160 apply the styles. So the first thing I
02:19:26.478 want to do is I want to change this to
02:19:28.280 container and then I want to apply one
02:19:31.679 for the header. So we'll call this
02:19:34.679 header. Then we'll probably have one for
02:19:37.439 the title. So I'll call this title. Uh
02:19:40.879 we already we don't pro we don't need
02:19:42.398 anything for the sign out button.
02:19:45.080 Then for this we're going to create one.
02:19:47.519 We're going to call it empty state. And
02:19:50.240 we'll do one for the text as well. We're
02:19:51.760 going to call it
02:19:54.680 empty state
02:19:57.560 text. And then for the habits, we pretty
02:20:00.319 much want to treat this as a card. So
02:20:02.319 I'm going to call this
02:20:04.600 card content.
02:20:08.000 Uh then for the text over here, I want
02:20:10.240 to have a card
02:20:12.920 title. Then on this one, I want to have
02:20:15.359 a card
02:20:19.319 description. And then for this view, we
02:20:21.920 want to this is the footer, right? This
02:20:23.920 is what goes below the or kind of like
02:20:25.840 at the bottom of the card. And it will
02:20:27.359 include the the streak and the
02:20:30.479 frequency. So I'm going to call this the
02:20:33.399 card footer. Now, the frequency or the
02:20:38.000 streak um view. We're going to call this
02:20:40.560 the
02:20:42.680 streak badge. And we'll put a styling to
02:20:45.520 the text. I'm going to call this the
02:20:47.399 streak text. Then for this view, we're
02:20:51.040 going to call it similar to this. We're
02:20:52.479 going to call it the frequency badge
02:20:54.160 instead. So,
02:20:57.160 frequency badge. And the text will be
02:21:00.399 frequency text. Now, we want to put an
02:21:02.880 extra element above the view, which is
02:21:05.280 going to have the style of the card. So,
02:21:07.280 we're going to use the um surface
02:21:09.560 component. This is a React Native paper
02:21:12.319 component that creates a material design
02:21:14.640 surface for a card. So, it's just going
02:21:17.600 to help us style our card better. So,
02:21:20.160 I'm going to import that and I'm going
02:21:21.359 to put it around this. So, it's going to
02:21:23.680 wrap it. And for the surface, we're
02:21:25.760 going to create here a style, which is
02:21:29.120 going to be styles.card. card and we're
02:21:32.000 also going to put an elevation of
02:21:35.319 zero. So now let's go to our styles over
02:21:38.479 here and let's make each individual one.
02:21:40.240 So the first one is the container which
02:21:42.640 is going to be flex one. Uh we're not
02:21:44.720 going to justify anything uh but we're
02:21:46.640 going to put a padding of 16 and we're
02:21:50.000 going to put a background
02:21:51.880 color of
02:21:54.399 uh # F5 F5 F5. Perfect. Now we're going
02:21:59.520 to make here the
02:22:01.160 header. The header we're going to have a
02:22:03.880 flex direction. So flex direction is
02:22:08.240 equal to
02:22:09.880 row. Now we're going to justify the
02:22:12.319 content to be space
02:22:16.280 between. And then we're going to align
02:22:20.319 the items to the
02:22:23.720 center. And I put a double comma here.
02:22:27.359 And then we're going to set a margin
02:22:31.160 bottom to be
02:22:33.800 24. So we have some space. Now after
02:22:37.600 this, we want to style the title. So
02:22:40.319 this thing over here, the title is going
02:22:42.880 to be pretty simple. I just want to
02:22:44.080 change the the font weight to be bold.
02:22:47.040 So we have a bold
02:22:48.840 text. Then below this, we want to start
02:22:51.359 styling the card. So the card is going
02:22:53.200 to be huge. We want a margin
02:22:56.920 bottom to be 18. So there's some space
02:23:00.399 in between the cards. Then we want a
02:23:03.160 border radius to be 18 as
02:23:07.319 well. We want a background color to be a
02:23:10.960 little bit different from the color of
02:23:12.720 the the the whole screen. So we're going
02:23:15.600 to say
02:23:16.840 F7 F2 F8. And you see it's a little bit
02:23:21.600 purple. It's hard to see, but I can see
02:23:23.120 it on my screen. Uh, then I'm going to
02:23:25.200 put a shadow color so we can actually
02:23:28.080 see a shadow. And it's going to be 0
02:23:31.000 0. Then I'm going to put a shadow offset
02:23:36.319 to be to have a width of zero, but
02:23:39.399 height of
02:23:41.399 two. And then I'm going to put a shadow
02:23:44.520 opacity to have 0.08 opacity. So it's
02:23:48.240 very, very small.
02:23:50.240 And then I'm going to put a shadow
02:23:52.479 radius to be
02:23:55.160 eight. And then finally the elevation to
02:23:58.319 be four. Perfect. So it's kind of
02:24:00.640 elevated and you can see it clearly. Now
02:24:03.120 let's add the card
02:24:06.040 content. So I'll say card content. And
02:24:09.280 we're going to just add some padding to
02:24:11.840 it because it's all cluttered at the
02:24:13.680 side over here. So we're just going to
02:24:14.720 put a padding a default padding on all
02:24:16.319 directions of 20. And it looks a lot
02:24:18.560 better now. Then we want to put the card
02:24:21.520 title, which uh I guess the card title
02:24:24.880 would be this one over here. And um for
02:24:28.000 the card title, we're going to put a
02:24:30.880 font size to be 20. So it's a little bit
02:24:34.960 bigger. Um then we're going to put a
02:24:38.800 font weight to be
02:24:42.600 bold. Perfect. And oh, I just I wrote
02:24:46.240 card. So let me put card title. And now
02:24:48.560 it actually updates. Then I want to put
02:24:51.200 a margin bottom to be four. And I
02:24:55.359 actually want to make the color of this
02:24:58.000 look a little bit different. I want to
02:24:59.920 put the color and make it be
02:25:03.960 #222 3B. So it's it's not technically
02:25:07.439 black. I don't know if you can even
02:25:08.960 notice that it's not technically black.
02:25:10.640 Now let's copy this and we're going to
02:25:13.600 make a card description. So, card
02:25:16.840 description, the font size will be
02:25:19.120 smaller will be 15. But we're also not
02:25:22.160 going to make it bold. We only want to
02:25:23.840 make the title be bold. So, I'll just
02:25:25.920 delete this. And we'll make a margin
02:25:29.359 bottom of
02:25:31.399 16. And then let's make the color a bit
02:25:34.240 different. I'm going to make it be 6 C 6
02:25:38.600 80. Perfect. It's like a lighter gray.
02:25:42.000 Then we want to make the card
02:25:45.000 footer. And the card footer we need to
02:25:47.680 it's a view. It's not a text or
02:25:49.600 anything. So it's this part over here
02:25:51.200 that encompasses this whole thing. So
02:25:52.960 what we want to do is we want to first
02:25:55.200 put a flex direction, right? We'll put a
02:25:58.080 flex direction of row so that things are
02:25:59.840 actually next to each other. Then we're
02:26:02.880 going to put uh justify content and
02:26:05.520 we'll put space between. You'll see that
02:26:08.319 it will now make a space in between the
02:26:10.080 two different elements uh that are
02:26:12.640 inside of this flex. Then I want to
02:26:15.680 align the items to be center. Perfect.
02:26:20.000 So that it aligns it vertically. Now for
02:26:23.040 the items inside of the footer we have
02:26:25.439 the streak badge. And this one we want
02:26:29.439 to put a flex direction of row. I
02:26:32.880 believe this is also a view. Uh so we'll
02:26:36.240 put it as row and then we'll put align
02:26:39.880 items to be center. We'll put the
02:26:43.680 background
02:26:45.399 color and I'm going to make it a
02:26:47.920 specific color as well. We're going to
02:26:49.520 put #
02:26:53.000 fff30. So there's like a kind of like
02:26:55.840 you know this little orange uh tint to
02:26:59.280 this area just to count your string.
02:27:01.920 Then I'm going to put a border
02:27:06.680 radius of 12 so it doesn't just look
02:27:09.280 like a square. And then let's make the
02:27:13.880 padding horizontal. So this is just a
02:27:16.640 padding on the x direction. We're going
02:27:18.399 to put it as 10. And we'll put a padding
02:27:22.920 vertical as
02:27:25.399 four. Perfect. Now I just I keep putting
02:27:28.479 extra comments. Uh, but then down here,
02:27:31.600 let's make the streak text. So, streak
02:27:35.080 text, I'm going to make this have a
02:27:37.920 margin left of six. So, there's some
02:27:40.479 space from the left. I'm going to put a
02:27:42.399 color to be
02:27:45.479 #
02:27:48.439 FF980. And you'll see that uh this will
02:27:52.240 make it kind of an orange, but not too
02:27:54.240 orange uh not too light such that you
02:27:56.960 can actually see it. Then we're going to
02:27:59.520 make the font be bold so you can see it
02:28:01.680 even better. So font weight, we're going
02:28:03.920 to set it equal to bold. Perfect. Then
02:28:07.600 finally, I'll make the font size be 14.
02:28:10.479 Now, I always recommend using bold
02:28:12.160 overusing bold when you're working with
02:28:13.840 an app because uh differently from like
02:28:16.800 a website uh on your app, making things
02:28:19.840 bold actually looks really really good.
02:28:21.760 Um, so I always tend to hyperfocus on
02:28:24.800 things specific like specific elements
02:28:26.720 that I want to uh be distincted uh or
02:28:30.000 distinctful in the page. I I make it
02:28:33.000 bold. Then I want to copy this whole
02:28:36.720 thing and we're going to make a similar
02:28:38.640 one but for the frequency. So we're
02:28:40.960 going to make a frequency badge and
02:28:43.680 we're going to make a frequency text.
02:28:45.920 Now there are some changes that we were
02:28:47.680 going to make to them, right? So, for
02:28:49.280 example, for the frequency badge, the
02:28:51.359 color is not going to be this. It's
02:28:52.880 going to be
02:28:53.880 ED
02:28:55.960 7F6. What this will do is we'll make it
02:28:58.160 kind of purple. And to match that, we're
02:29:00.560 going to make the color of this one be 7
02:29:02.960 C 4 D FFF, which will make it kind of
02:29:07.280 purple as well. Now another change that
02:29:09.600 we need to make is uh I'm going to
02:29:12.399 remove the flex direction the align
02:29:15.600 items from this and I'm also going to
02:29:18.720 change the horizontal padding to be 12.
02:29:23.040 The padding vertical can be the same.
02:29:24.800 Now the margin left over here doesn't
02:29:26.640 make sense because we only put that here
02:29:29.520 because there's a little icon on the uh
02:29:32.319 streak, right? So we don't need this. So
02:29:34.000 I'll remove it and it will now look a
02:29:35.760 lot better. And also what we can do is
02:29:38.960 you see how there's it says daily
02:29:41.840 because that's that's how we saved it.
02:29:43.359 It's it's capital D and then it's uh the
02:29:46.160 whole word is daily, right? It it has
02:29:48.160 lowercase letters after that. But what
02:29:50.479 we can do which is interesting is we can
02:29:52.479 actually capitalize the whole text. We
02:29:54.560 can use this property called text
02:29:57.479 transform and it allows you to make uh
02:30:00.240 transformations to the capitalization of
02:30:02.319 a word. I can make it uppercase if I
02:30:04.560 wanted to and the whole thing would be
02:30:06.640 transformed into an uppercase letter
02:30:08.399 even though the original string isn't
02:30:10.640 uppercase. Now I just wanted to show
02:30:12.640 this because I think it's cool. Uh but
02:30:14.560 we don't want to do this in our case
02:30:16.399 since it's already good. It's already
02:30:18.080 capital D. Um even though we did this
02:30:20.080 manually, we could have done it through
02:30:21.520 here as well using the capitalize
02:30:23.640 property. So now all we have left is the
02:30:27.680 empty state and the empty state text.
02:30:30.160 So, I'm going to come down here and
02:30:32.080 let's make it an empty
02:30:35.240 state. And I'll make the flex be one.
02:30:38.479 I'll make the justify content be center.
02:30:41.439 And I'll align items to the center cuz
02:30:43.600 to be honest, in an empty um state, we
02:30:47.200 don't want to do too much things. So,
02:30:48.640 we'll say empty
02:30:50.280 state text. And I'll just set the color
02:30:54.560 of it to be a bunch of sixes. So, six
02:30:57.920 six.
02:30:59.840 Now we have our cord done. If I wanted
02:31:02.720 to add another item, another habit, I
02:31:05.280 could come over here and I would add,
02:31:07.840 for example, we added meditating. Let's
02:31:09.760 do
02:31:11.240 drink five gallons. I think five gallons
02:31:14.880 is too much. I think one gallon of water
02:31:16.479 is good, but yeah, drink five gallons of
02:31:18.160 water. I'll make it weekly in this case.
02:31:20.560 So, drink a bunch of
02:31:24.840 water every day.
02:31:29.439 And then I'll make this weekly. It's
02:31:30.960 every day because you can space out the
02:31:32.560 five gallons in your week. Then I'll
02:31:34.560 click add habit. And where is the habit?
02:31:37.439 Well, it's not here, right? Because
02:31:39.359 what's happening is this is fetching the
02:31:42.319 information from our table when this
02:31:45.120 screen is rendered. So right now the
02:31:48.479 screen is not being rendered. It's not
02:31:50.080 fetching the data because it fetched it
02:31:51.600 once, right? When we had the use effect.
02:31:53.840 Only way for it to fetch again is if
02:31:56.479 either you change what the user is by,
02:32:00.640 for example, making the user not be
02:32:03.680 signed in or if you connect uh the your
02:32:08.640 screen to listen to real-time changes in
02:32:11.520 the habits table. So for example, we
02:32:14.399 could force this by making user equal to
02:32:16.760 null. And obviously that would break.
02:32:19.120 Then I'll remove this over here. And
02:32:21.600 you'll see that it will fetch again the
02:32:23.040 data because user changed. But now
02:32:24.560 there's a valid user and we have here.
02:32:26.800 But we want to listen to this
02:32:27.760 automatically. When we change this, we
02:32:30.000 want it to show up over here no matter
02:32:31.680 what. So to do this, here's what we're
02:32:33.760 going to do inside this use effect.
02:32:35.920 We're going to be using this function
02:32:38.640 from um from apprite called the
02:32:41.680 subscribe function. So we're going to
02:32:43.520 make a subscription called the habit
02:32:45.680 subscription. And this is going to
02:32:47.600 actually subscribe to an event that
02:32:49.760 happens in our database table. Now to do
02:32:52.000 that we have to have access to the
02:32:53.600 client. And the client we can access in
02:32:56.160 the apprite. It's this thing that we
02:32:57.920 exported over here. So we're going to
02:33:00.080 say client over here. We're going to
02:33:03.680 import it from apprite. Then we're going
02:33:06.160 to say
02:33:07.319 client.subscribe. Now we have to specify
02:33:09.920 what are we subscribing to. So it's a
02:33:11.840 table in our database. But the thing is
02:33:14.080 to specify what you're subscribing to,
02:33:16.399 you have to actually make this string
02:33:18.080 that is going to let appright know what
02:33:20.880 table and what collection you are
02:33:22.640 subscribing to. So we have to say that
02:33:24.640 we're subscribing to
02:33:26.600 databases. So it's a database. We have
02:33:29.439 to insert here the database ID for the
02:33:31.920 database that we are subscribing to. So
02:33:34.319 we'll insert database ID. Then we want
02:33:37.200 to at another dot put collections and
02:33:40.800 then specify the ID of the collection
02:33:43.680 that we are subscribing to. So I'm going
02:33:45.760 to say
02:33:46.680 habits collection ID and then we want to
02:33:50.160 say that we're subscribing to the
02:33:52.040 documents or to any changes in the
02:33:54.960 documents of this collection. So the
02:33:57.359 whole string would look like this. Um
02:34:00.160 yeah like this. So when this uh client
02:34:05.680 is subscribed, we're going to execute
02:34:08.160 this function over here. So every time
02:34:10.080 there's a change in uh this operation
02:34:13.439 that we're subscribing to this callback
02:34:15.920 function is going to be executed and
02:34:17.680 inside of here we can get the response
02:34:20.560 which we need to make a type for that.
02:34:22.399 I'm going to make it on the app right uh
02:34:24.720 file over here. Uh the type for this
02:34:27.280 it's going to be the following. Uh I'll
02:34:29.040 just make it below this. I'm going to
02:34:31.359 export an interface called real
02:34:35.160 time
02:34:36.760 response and it's going to have a list
02:34:39.280 of events which is a list of strings and
02:34:42.399 it's going to have a payload which we
02:34:43.920 don't know what it's going to be because
02:34:45.439 it depends on what type of response we
02:34:47.600 have but we'll make this be of that
02:34:50.399 type. Now we have to import this from
02:34:53.640 apprite. Now inside of this we have to
02:34:56.240 check for the different operations that
02:34:58.479 might happen to the event. So in this
02:35:00.880 project we have three operations that we
02:35:02.880 want to detect. We want to be able to
02:35:05.439 create a new habit. So when we create a
02:35:07.760 habit we want to detect uh and show that
02:35:10.240 up over here. We want to be able to
02:35:12.160 update it because we want to be able to
02:35:13.840 complete the the habit for the day and
02:35:17.520 increase the streak and also maybe
02:35:20.160 demonstrate that it's completed and also
02:35:22.560 delete it because you can delete a
02:35:24.080 habit. So we have to handle what happens
02:35:26.399 on all of those three scenarios. And in
02:35:28.479 all of those three scenarios, what
02:35:29.680 happens is we just fetch the list of
02:35:31.680 habits again to show the new uh habits
02:35:35.600 list, right? And what I want to do here
02:35:38.000 is I want to create a channel. So I'm
02:35:40.880 going to say channel is equal to and
02:35:43.520 then I want to actually get this list
02:35:47.040 over here. And let's actually extract
02:35:48.720 that and make it into a variable. So I'm
02:35:51.120 going to call it the channel because
02:35:52.160 this is the channel that we're
02:35:53.120 subscribing to. And then I'll just pass
02:35:55.359 this value here instead of making it to
02:35:57.520 the string. And we want to reuse this
02:35:59.840 because then what we can do is in this
02:36:02.160 response we can check if the response
02:36:06.200 dot events
02:36:09.160 do.inccludes and if the event includes a
02:36:12.479 create operation which we can detect by
02:36:15.280 saying databases
02:36:20.280 doall.colctions doall.d
02:36:23.160 documents
02:36:25.800 doall.create and then it will specify
02:36:27.920 that this is just for create operations.
02:36:30.080 Then we want to fetch the habits again.
02:36:33.040 So I'll say fetch habits. Now we can do
02:36:36.240 this as well and you will understand why
02:36:38.080 we're doing this for each of them but
02:36:40.080 we're going to then put an else if and
02:36:43.120 we can put the same thing but instead of
02:36:45.359 saying response.events events, we change
02:36:47.520 this to
02:36:48.520 update and we'll also fetch the habits.
02:36:51.760 And if that there's a delete, we're
02:36:54.720 going to also fetch the habits. Now, the
02:36:57.040 reason why I'm I'm putting specific else
02:36:59.120 ifs for each of them doing the same
02:37:00.960 thing is just because later on we're
02:37:03.520 actually going to have another
02:37:04.800 subscription uh that uh we're not using
02:37:07.680 right now, but we're obviously going to
02:37:08.880 fetch the information of which u habits
02:37:12.160 were completed today. So to do that,
02:37:14.720 we're going to have to have this little
02:37:16.399 if else if else u group over here. Now
02:37:20.080 what we want to do is we actually want
02:37:21.359 to pull this fetch habits the initial
02:37:23.680 one below this. So we're going to put it
02:37:26.160 like right over here. And at the end
02:37:29.840 when after subscribing to it and
02:37:32.880 fetching the habits, we actually want to
02:37:34.560 clean up this use effect just so we
02:37:37.439 avoid any memory leaks. And then for
02:37:39.040 this we'll just say habits subscription.
02:37:42.000 And this function when called will
02:37:44.240 actually cancel and unsubscribe the
02:37:46.880 subscription. So now if everything seems
02:37:49.760 to be working, we can go here and add a
02:37:52.000 new habit. So let me add a habit over
02:37:53.920 here. Let's make it 100 push-ups. And
02:37:57.520 I'll put here do 100 push-ups every day.
02:38:02.479 Make it daily. Click add habit. And it's
02:38:05.200 broken. So I figure out why it's broken.
02:38:07.760 we have to actually wrap this whole
02:38:09.920 thing around with an
02:38:12.359 if
02:38:14.359 user just to detect if the user is
02:38:16.960 actually here and we'll put this and now
02:38:21.280 it should be working. So, when I come
02:38:23.280 over here to add habit and I delete this
02:38:25.600 and I add I don't know, let me think of
02:38:27.120 another habit. Uh, I've done meditation.
02:38:29.600 I've done adding push-ups. I'll do okay
02:38:33.240 workout and I'll put
02:38:35.560 here do push pull legs uh split. I don't
02:38:41.120 know. I'll put it uh daily thing. Add
02:38:43.760 habit. And now we should navigate back
02:38:46.319 to the work to the main page and the new
02:38:50.240 um habit should appear over here. Now
02:38:53.840 this works perfectly. But one thing you
02:38:55.520 might notice is if I come over here and
02:38:57.120 I add a monthly thing like meet up with
02:39:00.960 or actually call an old friend. This
02:39:05.280 might be something cool. Uh call someone
02:39:08.560 you haven't in a while and make that
02:39:12.640 monthly. I click add habit. Where is
02:39:15.359 that? Well, it's down here. But how do
02:39:17.200 how do I scroll it down? There's no way
02:39:19.120 to scroll it down because we didn't make
02:39:20.560 this screen be scrollable. So, how do we
02:39:22.640 do that? So, to do that, we have to come
02:39:24.800 down here and we're going to go to where
02:39:27.040 we we map the list of habits. So, uh
02:39:31.840 probably around here. And we're going to
02:39:33.760 actually make this whole thing be
02:39:36.080 surrounded by a scroll view from React
02:39:38.800 Native. Now, a scroll view is what it's
02:39:41.359 just like what the name implies. It's
02:39:42.960 going to make this whole section be
02:39:44.600 scrollable. Um, you see it already
02:39:47.280 works, but we can specify certain part
02:39:50.080 of it of like what we want to do like
02:39:52.560 the style and so on. So, first of all,
02:39:54.640 when scrolling, I don't want this to
02:39:56.080 look like a website where it shows the
02:39:58.160 this indicator over here. So, we can say
02:40:01.600 that it shows vertical scroll indicator
02:40:05.439 and we'll set it equal to false. And
02:40:07.680 then what happens is guess what? It
02:40:09.520 doesn't show up. Now you can apply other
02:40:11.840 types of um styling to this and maybe we
02:40:14.800 will later on but uh for now we are fine
02:40:18.319 with this. Let's think of what we want
02:40:20.160 to do now. Well the first thing I want
02:40:22.000 to be able to do is delete habit just
02:40:24.720 because it's kind of annoying to have a
02:40:26.160 bunch of habits here. Maybe I want to
02:40:27.520 create some other ones just to practice
02:40:30.000 like how do we do that? Well, to do
02:40:32.000 that, I want to do this thing on this
02:40:35.120 habit screen where if you want to delete
02:40:37.760 a habit, you can swipe it to the left to
02:40:40.399 the right. And if you want to complete a
02:40:42.080 habit, you can swipe it from the right
02:40:43.760 to the left. So, that's something
02:40:45.920 complicated and it exists on a bunch of
02:40:48.479 different apps, but people sometimes
02:40:50.560 don't know how to make this happen. So,
02:40:52.240 I thought it would be a good um thing to
02:40:54.240 teach you guys. So to do that, we're
02:40:56.240 going to be using this um library which
02:41:00.080 is going to help us detect different
02:41:01.920 gestures that the user is making. And
02:41:05.920 the library is going to be called um
02:41:09.120 we're going to install it. It's going to
02:41:10.479 be called React Native
02:41:13.880 Gesture Handler. So we expo install it.
02:41:17.920 It will install it into our project. We
02:41:20.080 do have to go to our layout to actually
02:41:22.319 enable it. So I'm going to go to this
02:41:24.240 layout over here. And what we want to do
02:41:25.760 is we want to above the O provider, I
02:41:28.800 want to add a
02:41:30.840 gestured handler
02:41:33.479 root view. Now this is going to be
02:41:36.880 something that we wrap around the whole
02:41:38.720 thing. Uh not enough provider
02:41:43.160 gestured. I'll just copy this whole
02:41:45.200 thing. And I want to self-close it.
02:41:48.080 Perfect. And we want to import this from
02:41:52.240 not from that. Let's import it
02:41:55.640 from let's say
02:41:58.120 React native gesture handler. And we
02:42:01.280 want to import the
02:42:04.200 gesture handler root view. Perfect. Uh
02:42:09.680 oh, I wrote it wrong. That's why it
02:42:11.359 wasn't autoimp importing. But perfect.
02:42:13.760 Now in this root view, we do have to
02:42:15.439 pass a style to it. or you don't have
02:42:17.439 to, but I want to specifically just make
02:42:19.200 the
02:42:20.040 flex be equal to one. Um, so we'll say
02:42:24.439 flex is equal to one. And I'll set this
02:42:27.680 equal here. Perfect. Now inside of this
02:42:32.640 anywhere in our app, we can detect
02:42:34.880 different uh gestures that the user is
02:42:38.319 um making. The one that we want to do is
02:42:41.040 we want to detect when they gesture a
02:42:43.359 different habit from the right to left
02:42:45.600 or from the left to right. Now, inside
02:42:47.680 of the habits list over here, we're
02:42:49.439 going to map each habit and wrapping
02:42:51.439 around the habit card. I want to make
02:42:53.840 this be a swipeable component. So, I'll
02:42:56.880 just wrap this whole thing around with
02:42:59.120 the swipeable. And in the swipeable over
02:43:02.880 here, I want to set a couple properties.
02:43:05.439 The first property I want to set is I
02:43:07.760 want to make a ref. And a ref is a
02:43:10.399 reference to which um so which of the
02:43:14.720 individual habits I'm applying this
02:43:18.240 gesture handling. So to do that I
02:43:20.640 actually need to make a list of
02:43:23.600 different uh cards that I'm going to
02:43:25.920 store inside of a use ref. So we're
02:43:28.880 going to be using one of React's core
02:43:30.479 hooks called the user ref hook. We're
02:43:32.319 going to make a list of the elements by
02:43:35.439 making a swipeable ref list. So,
02:43:38.240 swipeable um refs. We're going to set
02:43:40.960 this equal to uh use
02:43:44.520 ref. And in this ref, we need to pass a
02:43:47.760 type to it. We're going to initialize it
02:43:49.680 as just an empty object, but we can make
02:43:52.399 it into actually of the following type.
02:43:55.040 It's going to be a key value pair. The
02:43:57.520 key is going to have a string type and
02:43:59.920 the value is going to be of type
02:44:02.920 swipeable. Then, we're going to make
02:44:04.880 this possibly null if there's any
02:44:06.640 issues. And I do need to actually wrap
02:44:09.359 this around with uh curly braces because
02:44:11.680 it's an object. Then on swipeable refs,
02:44:14.720 we actually want to use that to assign
02:44:16.640 each individual um habit into its own
02:44:20.240 ref. So, how am I going to do that is
02:44:22.240 this ref uh property over here allows me
02:44:24.560 to put a callback function that will
02:44:28.000 allow me to set the current value of
02:44:31.200 this swipable refs uh reference list to
02:44:36.160 have to have the individual current
02:44:39.479 property have a key which is the ID of
02:44:42.800 this habit. So I'll say habit do id and
02:44:46.800 the value is going to be the reference
02:44:49.520 of this element that I can get it from
02:44:51.439 here. So I'll set it equal to ref. Then
02:44:54.240 I need to pass a key to this um
02:44:58.319 swipeable. That's why we didn't pass a
02:45:00.160 key to the surface just because uh we
02:45:02.960 were going to pass it eventually to the
02:45:04.319 swipeable component which is the uh
02:45:07.279 parent of this. Actually we passed it to
02:45:08.960 the view over here. It was before we put
02:45:11.120 the surface. So I'm going to remove
02:45:12.640 that. I'm going to put it here. And um
02:45:15.680 actually this has to be outside of this
02:45:18.960 function over here. I didn't realize we
02:45:20.319 were making that inside of the function.
02:45:22.160 Then below this we actually have to
02:45:24.960 we're going to put the following
02:45:26.720 properties. We're going to put an
02:45:28.279 overshoot left to be equal to false. So
02:45:32.000 we don't actually detect like we don't
02:45:34.640 want the swiping to be very responsive.
02:45:37.920 We want it to be just as much as the
02:45:40.640 user is actually swiping. If we
02:45:42.160 overshoot it to left or to right, which
02:45:44.640 we also need to do, it will actually
02:45:47.120 increase the or decrease the friction of
02:45:49.600 which the user is swiping and it might
02:45:52.479 cause them to accidentally swipe an
02:45:54.160 event uh which might not be something
02:45:56.560 that they want to do. We want it to be
02:45:57.920 literally you swipe and you make sure
02:45:59.760 that you're swiping uh before deleting
02:46:02.319 or completing a task. Then we want to
02:46:05.680 render how the uh like how the card is
02:46:10.479 going to look like when the user swipes
02:46:13.600 to the left or to the right. So we can
02:46:16.240 actually change the styling of it and
02:46:18.000 render a component or a view um
02:46:21.359 depending on which side they are
02:46:22.880 swiping. So the way we do this is we
02:46:25.040 come over here and we can pass a render
02:46:27.840 left actions and we can pass a render
02:46:30.399 right actions. Then we create functions
02:46:33.920 that will render those like how the view
02:46:37.200 is going to look like when the user is
02:46:39.040 swiping from the left and from the
02:46:40.640 right. So I'm going to create a render
02:46:42.319 left um actions uh for this one. I'll
02:46:46.960 just copy this and paste it here. And
02:46:48.640 I'll also do the same thing. Then up
02:46:50.960 here we want to make those functions and
02:46:54.640 style those views. So we'll paste the
02:46:56.720 render right
02:46:59.080 action and I'll make the same thing but
02:47:02.479 for the left action. Now I understand
02:47:04.880 this library is kind of confusing and I
02:47:06.880 wouldn't worry that much about it. It's
02:47:08.080 just for specific use cases. You might
02:47:09.920 not even use it again. Uh but for this
02:47:12.640 use case we we have to do this. Now the
02:47:16.000 way we style it is for the write action.
02:47:19.120 I'm actually going to just remove this
02:47:21.600 and make it into parenthesis because
02:47:23.120 we're returning some some JSX, right?
02:47:26.240 And we'll return a view which inside of
02:47:29.359 it, it's going to have an icon. The icon
02:47:32.080 we want to use is a material community
02:47:34.319 icons which is going to be a check mark.
02:47:37.600 So the name of this icon is going to be
02:47:39.439 a check circle outline. We're going to
02:47:43.040 put a size of it to be
02:47:44.920 32. And we'll put a color of it. And the
02:47:47.920 color we are going to make it be #
02:47:52.279 fff. Now we'll also put some styling to
02:47:55.920 it later on. But for now, we'll just
02:47:58.000 copy this and we'll put it here.
02:48:01.920 And on this one, instead of using the
02:48:04.800 check, we're actually going to make the
02:48:07.399 trash can outline because swiping on the
02:48:11.840 left deletes a habit and swiping on the
02:48:14.479 right just completes it, right? So those
02:48:17.040 icons make sense. So you can see that
02:48:18.560 now if I swipe it, uh the icon appears
02:48:21.040 on the left for the trash can and the
02:48:23.279 icon appears on the right for the check
02:48:24.960 mark. Now the reason why I made it white
02:48:27.040 is just because uh we're going to make
02:48:29.040 the background of them be different
02:48:30.720 colors. So for the view over here, we're
02:48:33.120 going to put uh for the right action,
02:48:34.479 we're going to put a style. And we're
02:48:36.160 going to create a style called
02:48:39.240 swipe
02:48:40.840 action right. We'll do the exact same
02:48:44.000 thing on the left over
02:48:45.960 here. And uh we should just need to
02:48:48.319 change this to
02:48:49.960 left. And we'll come down here and we'll
02:48:52.880 make those two. So, let's make a
02:48:56.520 swipe
02:48:58.120 left or action
02:49:01.640 left. And let's duplicate this and make
02:49:05.359 one for the
02:49:08.520 right. Perfect. Now, for the uh left,
02:49:12.479 this is the one that we're going to uh I
02:49:15.840 believe have the trash can. So, we want
02:49:17.680 to first just style the content of it.
02:49:21.040 So, the container of it. We're going to
02:49:22.240 justify stuff to the center. So the
02:49:23.840 trash can is now in the middle. Then we
02:49:26.319 want to align the
02:49:28.600 items to be at flex
02:49:31.479 end and we want the flex of it to be
02:49:34.960 one. Now the reason for that is because
02:49:36.640 when you're swiping you want it to go
02:49:39.040 all the way and if you don't do that
02:49:41.200 then it won't actually allow you to uh
02:49:43.840 swipe it completely. Now it's stuck at
02:49:46.160 that point but when we finish adding the
02:49:47.840 style you'll see what I what will look
02:49:49.920 like. Now I'm going to put a background
02:49:53.399 color and make it be white or green. No,
02:49:57.920 actually this is the trash can. So let's
02:49:59.279 make it be red. And I have this red
02:50:01.200 color over here which is going to be 4 C
02:50:03.479 AF 50. No, sorry. This is actually the
02:50:06.720 color for the for the green. I'll even
02:50:09.200 copy and paste it here. Uh for the check
02:50:12.319 mark, sorry. For the red one, the trash
02:50:14.720 can, we're going to make
02:50:16.920 E53
02:50:19.720 935. And it will have this little cool
02:50:22.479 red color. Now, after this, we want to
02:50:25.520 put a
02:50:26.840 border radius of 18. And we want to put
02:50:32.080 a margin bottom of 18 as well. A margin
02:50:38.160 top of two and a padding right of
02:50:44.279 16. And this is how it's going to look
02:50:46.479 like. Then we can swipe it back and up.
02:50:48.720 So it kind of looks uh it kind of looks
02:50:51.840 pretty nice. Um now let's copy all of
02:50:55.760 this. Uh I'll just keep the color the
02:50:58.960 same. We're going to put the exact same
02:51:00.319 thing for the right, but this time it
02:51:03.439 looks like this. And on this one, it
02:51:05.200 looks like this. Now, uh I was
02:51:06.960 accidentally putting the styling for the
02:51:08.800 trash can uh on the other way. So, we
02:51:11.359 actually want to put this at the start,
02:51:13.359 not at the flex end. So, we'll put flex
02:51:16.160 start and then it will be here. But on
02:51:18.240 the check mark, it will be at the end.
02:51:20.000 And that means that actually we don't
02:51:21.760 want to put a padding right, we want to
02:51:23.279 put a padding left.
02:51:25.680 And you see now the trash can and the
02:51:28.560 check mark appear pretty nicely. Great.
02:51:31.680 But nothing is happening, right? Nothing
02:51:33.200 is happening when I'm swiping. We're not
02:51:34.800 deleting and we're not completing. So,
02:51:36.720 how are we going to actually complete
02:51:38.560 and delete a a habit? Now, let's start
02:51:41.200 with the delete cuz it's the easiest
02:51:43.200 one. for the delete. What I want to do
02:51:46.319 is I want to create this function up
02:51:50.680 here which is going to I'll make it
02:51:53.520 above the render right function which is
02:51:55.840 going to be called handle delete habit
02:51:59.680 and it's going to be an async function
02:52:02.560 that is going to call apprite and
02:52:05.040 actually delete the habit from our
02:52:06.880 database. Now on our styling over here,
02:52:10.319 on our swipeable over here, I'm going to
02:52:12.960 run this prop called on swipeable open.
02:52:17.520 And this will run every time you're
02:52:20.800 swiping for a direction either left or
02:52:22.960 right. Now, which direction do we know?
02:52:25.200 Uh well, you get it directly from this
02:52:28.000 um argument. It provides you a direction
02:52:30.319 over here. So we can detect it by saying
02:52:33.640 if direction is equal to
02:52:39.399 left then do something which in our case
02:52:42.399 is called a handle delete habit. But if
02:52:45.680 it's not then we're going to create
02:52:48.080 later on a function for the handle
02:52:50.160 complete habit. But we'll start with
02:52:51.600 this one. Also when we are deleting a
02:52:53.840 habit we need to know which habit we're
02:52:55.279 deleting. So in this handle delete
02:52:57.520 function we need to grab the id of the
02:53:01.160 habit. So in here we need to pass that
02:53:04.640 ID by saying habit do id. Perfect. Now
02:53:09.439 let's go back here and to delete an a a
02:53:12.960 document in your collection you can run
02:53:15.479 try and
02:53:17.720 catch. We'll put an error here. And when
02:53:21.520 we try this, we're going to await
02:53:25.560 databases and we're going to call the
02:53:28.080 delete document function. Similar to the
02:53:30.720 other operations, we have to specify the
02:53:32.880 database ID, the habits collection ID,
02:53:36.640 and we have to specify the ID of the
02:53:39.359 habit or the ID of the document we're
02:53:41.680 trying to delete, which we can just get
02:53:43.120 from the ID of this
02:53:45.479 function. Perfect. Now, if there's any
02:53:47.920 errors, to be honest, uh this isn't a
02:53:50.080 core functionality, so I don't need to
02:53:51.680 show anything. So, I'm just going to
02:53:53.279 console
02:53:56.520 error the actual error
02:53:59.720 message. Actually, I'll just console log
02:54:01.760 the error. Perfect. Now, let's try to
02:54:04.720 see if this works. Let's delete
02:54:07.560 the the workout. I don't like this one.
02:54:10.319 I'll swipe right. And you see that and
02:54:14.479 now accidentally the uh call an old
02:54:18.080 friend uh habit was the one selected
02:54:21.040 because the actual uh habit that we had
02:54:24.560 before was actually deleted. It's not
02:54:26.640 here anymore. We can't find it anywhere.
02:54:29.120 So we successfully deleted the habit.
02:54:31.200 But the reason why the when we swiped
02:54:35.040 the call an old friend one was the one
02:54:37.439 that was uh fully swiped instead is
02:54:40.640 because uh if you remember we have this
02:54:43.040 list of reps right and this is what
02:54:45.040 detects which habit we're trying to
02:54:46.560 delete. Uh when we deleted the fourth uh
02:54:50.240 habit over here uh that meant that the
02:54:53.040 ID of that um ref got removed from the
02:54:57.520 list but we didn't actually change it.
02:55:00.240 So now since this is the fourth element
02:55:02.640 because that the the one before it was
02:55:04.160 deleted now this was the one that is
02:55:06.080 swiped if you know what I mean right
02:55:07.439 it's it it just switched. So we actually
02:55:09.680 have to also tell the list uh that it is
02:55:13.840 updated. So how do we do that? Well on
02:55:16.479 the swipeable open over here after
02:55:19.600 either direction is handled we're going
02:55:21.439 to call the swipeable refs and we're
02:55:23.439 going to say current. We're going to get
02:55:25.760 the current habit ID. So to get the
02:55:29.040 current uh swipeable element and we can
02:55:32.399 actually forcefully close it so that the
02:55:35.359 last element isn't already uh open when
02:55:37.840 we try. So let's delete one over here.
02:55:40.080 I'm going to delete the 100 push-ups.
02:55:42.880 And you see it goes back automatically.
02:55:44.880 It closes and it actually deletes the
02:55:47.920 item. Perfect. Now let's start handling
02:55:51.279 the other action which is the ability to
02:55:53.600 complete a habit. Now to do this, we
02:55:56.319 actually want to keep track of all the
02:55:57.840 habits that are completed. Now I'll do
02:56:01.200 that actually by creating a new
02:56:03.279 collection in our ha habits database. So
02:56:06.479 I'm going to create a collection and I'm
02:56:08.160 going to call it habit
02:56:10.680 completions. Now the reason why we're
02:56:12.720 creating this is that it's going to be
02:56:15.359 such a specific thing for us to keep
02:56:17.680 track of which is going to be a lot
02:56:19.279 easier for us to then get this data
02:56:21.279 whenever we need it. So this table or
02:56:23.600 this collection is going to look very
02:56:25.439 simple. It's going to have three
02:56:26.560 attributes. The first one is going to be
02:56:28.319 a habit ID to reference which habit
02:56:30.960 we're trying to complete. We'll put the
02:56:32.800 size again to be a thousand or
02:56:34.560 something. We'll make it required. The
02:56:37.439 second attribute is going to again be a
02:56:39.840 string, but this one is going to
02:56:41.520 reference which user completed this
02:56:43.600 habit. So we're going to put a user ID
02:56:46.080 with a size of a,000 and it's required.
02:56:50.240 Now the last thing we need to know is
02:56:52.000 just when this habit was completed. So
02:56:54.560 we're going to put a completed at
02:56:57.640 property a size of a th00and and it's
02:57:00.880 also required. Now this is all we need
02:57:03.760 to know. Now we need to keep track of
02:57:06.000 the habits completion ID. So we're going
02:57:08.240 to copy this collections ID. We're going
02:57:10.960 to go back to our table. And in here,
02:57:13.600 we're going to go to the uh apprite
02:57:17.120 file. And actually, we need to put it in
02:57:19.680 our env file first. So, I'm actually
02:57:22.720 going to put it here. Going to copy
02:57:24.720 this. I'm going to change this to habits
02:57:28.479 uh to completions. Actually, let's call
02:57:30.240 it
02:57:31.319 completions. So, the completions
02:57:33.439 collection. And we're going to paste
02:57:34.880 this ID in here. Then let's go to our
02:57:38.720 apprite f uh file and let's export this
02:57:43.439 ID. So I'm going to copy this. Going to
02:57:46.720 call this the
02:57:49.880 completions collection ID. And then on
02:57:52.240 this one we'll change this to
02:57:54.160 completions as
02:57:56.040 well. Perfect. Now let's go to our
02:58:00.840 index.tsx. And in here, we want to
02:58:03.279 create a function that is going to be
02:58:05.359 similar to the handle delete habit, but
02:58:07.279 it's going to be a little bit more
02:58:08.560 intricate. So, we're going to call it
02:58:10.240 the handle
02:58:12.520 complete habit. And it's also going to
02:58:15.520 take in an ID, but instead of deleting a
02:58:18.319 document, we want to create a document.
02:58:21.600 We want to actually insert uh this habit
02:58:24.479 into the list of completed habits. So,
02:58:27.279 we're going to change this collection ID
02:58:28.960 to be completions collection ID instead.
02:58:32.720 And we do want to pass an ID here, but
02:58:35.279 it's not the ID of the habit we are
02:58:37.920 completing because that is going to go
02:58:40.479 in the actual payload that we're
02:58:42.720 sending. The ID of this is just going to
02:58:44.800 be an ID that we generate for this
02:58:46.560 table. So, we're going to say ID dot
02:58:50.040 unique. And then in here I want to pass
02:58:53.040 a habit ID and that's going to be equal
02:58:55.920 to the ID that we have from the
02:58:57.520 function. Then a user ID which has to be
02:59:02.000 equal to the user do ID but we have to
02:59:06.640 uh let's assert that the user exists
02:59:08.479 first. Let's actually uh come over here
02:59:11.279 and just say if not user then return. So
02:59:15.600 we skip this and now we don't have to
02:59:18.399 put that question mark and then we'll
02:59:21.040 pass a completed at. And the completed
02:59:23.520 at is going to be the current moment,
02:59:25.200 right? Because this function is going to
02:59:26.800 be called when the user completes the
02:59:28.399 action. So uh it's going to be a new
02:59:32.359 date to string. Perfect. Now when you
02:59:37.040 when a user completes u a habit, we
02:59:41.359 don't want it to just insert the new
02:59:43.200 habit on the habits completion. That's
02:59:44.800 just part of one of the things we want
02:59:46.399 to do. The other thing is we actually
02:59:48.080 want to update the habits table because
02:59:50.560 if you remember this table has a couple
02:59:52.880 attributes that are important. For
02:59:54.560 example, the street count should
02:59:56.080 increase, the last completed should
02:59:58.160 change and yeah, I think those two only
03:00:01.040 to be honest, but yeah, the street count
03:00:02.720 should increase so that we know that the
03:00:04.399 user now completed an extra day and the
03:00:06.560 last completed will let us know if the
03:00:08.640 user completed the um habit in the
03:00:12.080 current day. So what we do is after this
03:00:15.920 uh await over here we want to grab the
03:00:18.640 specific habit that oh I need to
03:00:21.359 actually come out of this. So here we
03:00:23.520 want to grab this specific habit that we
03:00:26.479 want to increase the streak of. So we're
03:00:28.160 going to say const habit is equal to
03:00:29.840 habits.find find and we'll find the
03:00:33.120 habit that has the h equal to the habit
03:00:39.920 do ID equal to the ID of this function.
03:00:44.240 So we just found the habit that we are
03:00:46.160 trying to complete. Then if for some
03:00:49.279 reason we didn't find any habits then
03:00:51.600 we'll just return and continue forward
03:00:54.240 and not actually do anything. But if we
03:00:57.680 do have a habit, then we want to call
03:01:00.200 await
03:01:02.359 databases.update document. And on this
03:01:04.720 update document, we want to pass the
03:01:07.439 database ID and the habits collection ID
03:01:10.800 since we're updating the habits
03:01:12.040 collection. And we want to specify which
03:01:15.120 document we want to update. So in the
03:01:16.640 update function you pass uh obviously
03:01:19.279 these two things that you pass on every
03:01:20.720 function but you have to pass the id of
03:01:22.479 the h of the document you want to update
03:01:24.479 which in our case is just ID it's the
03:01:26.720 thing we have here as an argument to
03:01:28.240 this function and then you have to pass
03:01:30.000 a payload and this payload is just going
03:01:32.080 to be what part of this document you
03:01:34.240 want to update whatever payload you pass
03:01:36.319 here whatever fields you pass will be
03:01:38.160 updated so the only two fields we want
03:01:39.840 to update is the streak count which we
03:01:44.080 want to make it equal to we're going to
03:01:46.240 basically increase it by one. So we do
03:01:49.200 have its current value because we just
03:01:52.080 currently got the habit from here,
03:01:54.000 right? So we can just say streak count
03:01:56.960 now will be habit dot streak count but
03:02:00.240 plus one. So we just increase it by one.
03:02:03.359 Now the second thing we want to update
03:02:04.720 is the last completed. We want to set it
03:02:08.000 equal to the current date. So I'm going
03:02:10.160 to say new
03:02:11.960 date equal to ISO string. Perfect. Now I
03:02:17.279 just realized as well that uh we were we
03:02:19.840 want to we definitely want to use the
03:02:21.200 same date for both of them. So what I
03:02:23.120 want to do is I want to actually get the
03:02:25.200 current date and set it equal to this
03:02:29.920 and then just reuse it twice so we don't
03:02:31.680 have any mis mismatches in between those
03:02:34.680 dates. Perfect. Now, if there's an
03:02:37.120 error, we'll just console log it and
03:02:38.800 it's fine. So, let's see if this works.
03:02:41.439 I'm going to call this when the
03:02:44.240 direction is is right. So, we're going
03:02:47.040 to say if else if direction is equal to
03:02:53.160 write, then we're going to call the
03:02:55.840 handle complete habit and we're going to
03:02:57.760 pass the habit do ID. Perfect. Now,
03:03:01.120 let's try completing a habit. Let's try
03:03:03.920 completing this calling an old friend
03:03:06.560 one. So I'm going to put right to left
03:03:09.160 and it says current user is not per
03:03:12.080 authorized to perform the requested
03:03:13.840 action. And the reason for that is
03:03:15.439 because we just made a new collection
03:03:18.560 this uh habit completions but we didn't
03:03:21.359 set up the policies for this collection
03:03:24.960 uh such that it doesn't allow any user
03:03:26.880 to do anything on it. So in the
03:03:29.200 permissions over here, we have to add a
03:03:31.439 role to what we want to allow users to
03:03:34.240 do with this um collection. I'm just
03:03:37.040 going to put all users and all users can
03:03:39.600 create uh read. Actually, I'm just going
03:03:42.479 to say create because I think that's the
03:03:44.080 only thing we're going to do for now. So
03:03:45.600 I'm going to click update and now users
03:03:48.399 are able to create. So let's try
03:03:52.359 again. Yeah, perfect. It worked. Not
03:03:55.520 only it we notice here that this um day
03:03:58.640 streak updated by one because we just
03:04:01.920 updated the the the thing right but also
03:04:04.720 if I go back here um and I go to
03:04:07.439 documents we see that the habit
03:04:08.800 completions u also has a new entry.
03:04:12.359 Perfect now I want to be able to fetch
03:04:15.359 the list of habits that were completed
03:04:17.680 today. Now the reason for that is
03:04:19.760 because of a couple things. First of
03:04:21.359 all, that will allow me to prevent a
03:04:24.080 user from being able to do this and all
03:04:27.040 of a sudden they completed the same uh
03:04:29.279 the same habit twice in the same day.
03:04:31.200 They just keep doing this infinitely.
03:04:33.040 But also because I want to have a
03:04:34.880 special styling when a habit was
03:04:37.040 completed today. So to do that I want to
03:04:40.399 actually create a function somewhere
03:04:42.720 here which is going to be similar to the
03:04:44.720 fetch habits function but it's going to
03:04:46.640 fetch the completed habits or the
03:04:49.279 completed uh yeah the completed habits
03:04:52.080 but for today. So I'm going to call this
03:04:54.760 fetch today
03:04:58.040 completions. Now this is going to be a
03:05:00.479 little bit different. What I want to do
03:05:01.520 is I want to know what today means. So
03:05:04.640 how do we fetch only uh completions that
03:05:08.080 were from today? Well to do that I'm
03:05:10.319 going to say const today is equal to new
03:05:13.240 date. Then I'm going to set the hours of
03:05:16.720 today to be so set hours to be 0 0 0.
03:05:24.319 Then when we are fetching the list of
03:05:26.720 documents in the query over here, which
03:05:29.520 by the way, this isn't going to be for
03:05:30.560 the habits collection. It will be for
03:05:32.399 the completions collection. Um, in the
03:05:37.040 query over here, we want to keep this
03:05:39.359 the same. We want to only query the
03:05:41.600 completions that were from the current
03:05:43.520 user. But we can add another query to
03:05:46.000 this because this is a list of queries,
03:05:47.760 right? And the second query is going to
03:05:49.680 be that we want to only copy or get the
03:05:53.479 completions that happen in the current
03:05:55.920 day. So query
03:05:58.359 dotgrater than or equal to and then
03:06:02.479 we'll put the property of completed at
03:06:05.760 to
03:06:07.000 be greater than or equal to today do two
03:06:12.240 iso string. So what this will do is it
03:06:15.520 will get all of the completions from the
03:06:18.319 completion collection which first of all
03:06:21.120 it was done by the user that is logged
03:06:23.359 in. So we don't get completions from
03:06:24.960 other users so it wouldn't make any
03:06:26.640 sense but also the ones that happened at
03:06:29.520 least after this morning which will only
03:06:32.640 get the completions from today. It
03:06:34.160 obviously won't get any from the future
03:06:35.760 because unless you manually edit the
03:06:37.920 database you should never have a
03:06:39.520 completion from the future right? So
03:06:41.600 only have it for today. And when we get
03:06:44.560 this back, we can grab it by saying con
03:06:49.640 completions is equal to
03:06:52.040 response dot actually we can just set it
03:06:55.120 directly similar to how we did with the
03:06:56.760 habits. Uh we're going to set we're
03:06:59.279 going to have to make a a state for
03:07:01.840 this. I'm going to come here and I'm
03:07:03.200 going to call it the
03:07:06.439 completed habits state and a set
03:07:10.319 completed habits. Now the type of this
03:07:13.120 is going to be a bit different. We're
03:07:14.720 going to create a new type here. Let's
03:07:17.680 export an
03:07:19.640 interface called habit
03:07:22.520 completion. And it will again extend the
03:07:26.840 models
03:07:28.920 document. And what I want this to be is
03:07:31.840 it's going to have a habit ID which is
03:07:34.640 equal to a string, a user ID which is
03:07:38.080 equal to a string and it's going to have
03:07:40.080 a completed at which is equal to a
03:07:43.760 string as well. Now in here we can now
03:07:46.960 use this uh habit completion type and
03:07:50.240 it's going to be a list of it as well.
03:07:51.920 Now, let's use this set habit
03:07:54.000 completions down here to instead of
03:07:56.399 setting the habits, we set the response
03:07:58.880 to documents as a habit completion list.
03:08:03.840 Perfect. Now, to be honest, if I'm
03:08:06.240 thinking about it, when we want to
03:08:08.319 detect if a habit was completed today,
03:08:10.880 it might be easier for us to make this
03:08:13.359 set completed habits um state to instead
03:08:16.479 of being a habit completion type uh
03:08:19.359 array, it just be a list of this of the
03:08:22.880 ids of this habit in the um in this
03:08:27.600 list. So instead of being a list of
03:08:29.279 completed habits, we have a list of
03:08:31.120 their ids. So that when we want to
03:08:34.319 detect if the current habit is
03:08:37.040 completed, we just detect if this list
03:08:39.040 of ids include the ID of the current
03:08:41.359 habit. So instead of doing this over
03:08:43.760 here, let's actually get this. So we'll
03:08:46.720 say completions is equal to this. We're
03:08:49.600 going to just put it over here just so
03:08:51.200 we can make it easier. And then I'm
03:08:53.040 going to transform this completed habits
03:08:55.120 uh which was previously a habit
03:08:57.200 completion type and I'm going to map
03:08:59.120 through it and I'm going to map each
03:09:02.000 completion to become just its id. So I'm
03:09:05.120 going to say habit id and uh now this
03:09:08.960 should be a list of strings with the ids
03:09:11.200 of the habit which is perfect because
03:09:13.200 one of the main things I want to prevent
03:09:14.960 is this uh allowance that we have for mo
03:09:19.439 for basically completing a habit
03:09:22.720 multiple times in the day. So to do that
03:09:25.680 instead to prevent that I can just come
03:09:27.520 to the handle complete habit and
03:09:29.439 prohibit that by saying if the completed
03:09:32.680 habits includes the ID of the current
03:09:36.399 habit. So this over here then return.
03:09:40.000 Now we're not fetching the completed
03:09:42.640 habits yet. So I'm going to actually
03:09:45.279 call it down here similar to what we did
03:09:47.120 with the habits. I'm going to fetch it.
03:09:50.160 And oh, I just realized that we didn't
03:09:52.560 set up a permission for reading on this
03:09:54.720 table as well. I completely missed that.
03:09:57.120 So let's set up a permission for reading
03:10:00.080 so that we don't get any errors. And
03:10:02.319 then now uh it should be fetching that
03:10:04.960 information. So if I try to complete
03:10:07.040 that, it doesn't it actually allows me
03:10:09.680 to maybe it's not actually fetching.
03:10:11.680 Wait, let me do let me comment this out.
03:10:15.680 Save it and then uncomment it and save
03:10:17.680 it. Let's try again.
03:10:19.920 And yeah, now it doesn't work. It was
03:10:21.359 just that um we did we for we we didn't
03:10:23.920 actually we got an error. So we didn't
03:10:25.520 actually fetch the completion again. So
03:10:29.200 you know what that means, right? It
03:10:30.479 means that we're not actually getting
03:10:33.120 the information about the completions in
03:10:35.359 real time. So similar to what we did
03:10:37.359 here with the habits, we want to have a
03:10:39.439 subscription for this new uh completions
03:10:42.240 table. Now what we're going to do is we
03:10:44.319 are going to um create another
03:10:48.120 subscription for but this one is going
03:10:50.240 to be the completion subscription. So
03:10:52.640 I'm going to call this actually you know
03:10:54.319 this channel over here. We're going to
03:10:55.840 call this the
03:10:57.720 habits channel. So we know that this is
03:11:01.040 just the channel for the habits
03:11:03.680 subscription. And we're going to copy
03:11:05.359 this entire logic and we're going to
03:11:06.960 paste it again down here. But we're
03:11:09.279 going to make this into the the
03:11:11.520 completions
03:11:13.319 channel. So we're subscribing to the
03:11:15.760 channel that detects any changes in the
03:11:18.160 completions table. So in the collections
03:11:21.520 ID here, we have to change this to the
03:11:24.439 completions collection ID. This will
03:11:27.680 also change it to the
03:11:29.800 completions
03:11:31.399 subscription and I'll pass the
03:11:34.000 completions channel instead. Now, one
03:11:37.279 thing that is important as well is with
03:11:39.520 a completion uh table, right? We don't
03:11:42.080 want to listen to a create to uh an
03:11:44.240 update or delete. Those those are not
03:11:46.160 actual things that uh we're actually
03:11:49.760 making on that table. We're just
03:11:51.120 creating completions. Um so, we're only
03:11:53.760 going to listen to a create event. And
03:11:56.080 when that happens, we want to fetch the
03:11:58.720 today's completions again. So, we'll
03:12:01.920 fetch the completions one more time. And
03:12:04.640 in the end here, we want to return the
03:12:07.040 unsubscribe function for this
03:12:08.720 subscription. So we'll just return and
03:12:11.520 call the completion subscriptions um
03:12:14.960 again. Perfect. Now let's try and see
03:12:18.000 what happens here. So let me try to
03:12:20.000 complete uh this and we should see that
03:12:24.560 this increased. Now it should have also
03:12:27.439 fetched the today's completions. But one
03:12:29.600 thing that is important is now if I try
03:12:32.000 doing this again, it doesn't actually
03:12:34.560 allow me to because it detected that
03:12:36.720 today we completed this habit. So it
03:12:40.240 won't allow us to pull this trick one
03:12:42.319 more time. So now another way that we
03:12:46.000 can actually separate completed um
03:12:48.399 habits from non-completed habits is we
03:12:50.319 can actually use this information to
03:12:52.000 kind of make the UI look a little bit
03:12:53.840 different if the habit was already
03:12:55.359 completed in the day. So, we're going to
03:12:57.520 actually create here a state um
03:13:01.359 somewhere. It's not going to be a state
03:13:02.479 actually. It's just going to be a
03:13:03.359 boolean called is habit completed. And
03:13:07.120 this is going to be a function that
03:13:08.560 returns a true or false statement of
03:13:10.560 whether or not a habit based on its ID
03:13:13.120 was completed or not. So, we're going to
03:13:15.520 make this into a function that requires
03:13:17.120 a habit ID, which is a string. for us to
03:13:20.160 know if the habit was completed, we
03:13:21.840 literally just have to check in the
03:13:23.279 completed habits array if it includes
03:13:25.760 the ID of this habit. So if it does,
03:13:29.279 then the habit that we are passing in
03:13:31.200 the argument of the function was
03:13:32.880 completed and this should return true.
03:13:35.040 If not, then it will turn false. And we
03:13:37.279 use this inside of our UI. So what I
03:13:40.239 want to do is I actually want to create
03:13:42.560 a version of the UI of this um card to
03:13:46.239 be called the card completed UI. We're
03:13:49.120 going to go to the surface that we have
03:13:50.640 over here. And in the style, instead of
03:13:53.359 passing one style, which is the style
03:13:55.439 for the card, we want to pass an array
03:13:57.760 of
03:13:58.760 styles. So, actually, we'll just keep it
03:14:01.200 the same, but we're going to pass an
03:14:02.239 array in here. So, I'm going to just do
03:14:05.760 this. And we're going to pass two
03:14:08.319 specific styles. The first one is the
03:14:10.560 styles.card, which is the default style.
03:14:13.279 But if the habit completed is true and
03:14:17.359 we do that we find out because we say is
03:14:19.920 habit completed and we pass the habit id
03:14:22.800 here. If that's true then we also want
03:14:26.640 to pass in this array a new style which
03:14:29.359 we're going to call it the card
03:14:32.319 um completed style. Now we don't have
03:14:34.560 that yet. So, we're going to go here to
03:14:36.160 styles and next to the card, I'm going
03:14:38.560 to create a card
03:14:41.800 completed. Now, you'll see that if based
03:14:44.880 on this, I just made the background of
03:14:48.000 the card completed be for example red.
03:14:52.720 I'll just make it red. You see that the
03:14:55.120 the habits that were completed today are
03:14:58.479 now being correctly uh distinguished
03:15:00.880 between the ones that haven't been
03:15:02.239 completed today. So, and by the way, I'm
03:15:05.200 recording this video in with multiple
03:15:07.359 days in the distance. So, uh that's why
03:15:10.000 I haven't actually completed this today.
03:15:11.439 This is already another day. So, I have
03:15:13.439 So, we're correctly detecting if it's a
03:15:15.760 different day. That's why. So, you guys
03:15:17.760 don't get confused with this. So, you
03:15:20.479 know, now we are correctly detecting
03:15:22.000 that. So, what styles do we want to
03:15:23.920 implement for the habits that have been
03:15:25.920 completed? Well, literally all I want to
03:15:27.760 do is I just want to make it a little
03:15:29.200 bit less visible. I'm going to set the
03:15:31.200 opacity to be 60%. And you'll see that
03:15:34.160 now it's clear that the ones that are
03:15:36.160 kind of grayed out are the ones that are
03:15:38.800 completed. Now, one thing we can do as
03:15:40.960 well is we're still going to want to
03:15:42.960 allow swipeable actions, right, when the
03:15:45.760 thing has been completed. Now,
03:15:46.960 obviously, the completed one isn't uh
03:15:49.920 going to increase this the one day
03:15:51.840 streak, but we want to allow the user to
03:15:53.279 be able to delete a habit if that's the
03:15:55.439 case. Now, what I want to do instead is
03:15:57.600 when the user tries to complete a habit
03:15:59.840 that they have already completed, I want
03:16:01.920 the check mark to be replaced with a
03:16:04.080 text saying uh completed or something
03:16:06.640 like that. So, oh, I accidentally
03:16:08.640 deleted that habit. But yeah, so we're
03:16:10.479 going to go to the uh to this over here,
03:16:13.439 the render write action. And in this
03:16:16.479 function, we're going to actually change
03:16:18.160 the argument of it to be to require a a
03:16:21.840 habit ID, which is going to be a string.
03:16:25.439 Now because of this when we call this
03:16:27.920 function we have to change this to
03:16:30.399 return back an anonymous function that
03:16:32.800 passes in the habit do
03:16:36.520 ID. Now in the render write function uh
03:16:40.080 we want to check here
03:16:42.359 if
03:16:44.359 the habit do the if is in habit
03:16:48.960 completed is true and we pass the habit
03:16:51.439 ID in here then we actually want to show
03:16:54.720 a text that will say
03:16:59.160 completed. If not, then we want to show
03:17:02.560 the check mark. And you'll see now that
03:17:04.239 when it's completed, it will say
03:17:05.680 completed. And when it's not, it will
03:17:07.920 show a check mark. Now, obviously, this
03:17:09.600 we need to put a style to it. Um, I to
03:17:12.960 be honest, I can just pass here a quick
03:17:14.720 style. Since it's just going to be a
03:17:15.920 small style, I can just put the color
03:17:17.760 and I'll make it be the same thing cuz
03:17:19.600 it's something that we also did here for
03:17:21.200 the check mark just so we don't have to
03:17:23.680 make an extra style for this. And you
03:17:25.439 see that now it looks a lot better.
03:17:27.600 Perfect. Now we are finally done with
03:17:30.160 this page. We want to now create the
03:17:34.000 last screen that we have which is the
03:17:35.920 streak screen. We have the add habit,
03:17:37.760 the today's habit and now let's make the
03:17:39.760 streak screen. So I'm going to close
03:17:41.359 this. We're going to open up here the
03:17:43.359 streaks um component. Now on this page
03:17:46.560 what I want to do is I want to first get
03:17:50.000 the data about the habits and the
03:17:52.720 completions because what we want to do
03:17:54.720 with this is we want to actually use
03:17:56.640 that data to rank the different habits
03:18:00.080 that uh have been completed just to show
03:18:02.239 the user which habits they're completing
03:18:04.640 more often and more not. So what we do
03:18:07.120 is in here we need that data as well.
03:18:09.680 Now the way we're going to do that is
03:18:11.359 we're going to go to index.tsx tsx and
03:18:14.080 we're going to copy this logic over
03:18:17.120 here. So, we're going to copy this
03:18:18.399 logic. We're going to paste it in here.
03:18:20.880 We're going to copy the use effect. But
03:18:22.880 to do that, there's a bunch of stuff
03:18:24.399 that we have to copy still. We have to
03:18:26.399 copy the the functions, right, for the
03:18:29.359 fetch habits and the fetch to date
03:18:31.479 completions. We're going to copy both of
03:18:33.640 them and we're going to paste it paste
03:18:36.479 it over here. And also, we're going to
03:18:39.120 have to copy the states. So, we're going
03:18:41.600 to copy the habits and the completion
03:18:44.439 states and as well we're going to put it
03:18:47.520 over here. Now, it's not just copy and
03:18:50.399 paste. We're going to have to make some
03:18:51.439 changes to them. So, first of all, let's
03:18:53.439 import some of the stuff from React. So,
03:18:55.840 like the use state and the use effect
03:18:58.279 hook. Now, we want the habits array to
03:19:02.080 be a list of habits. So, we have to
03:19:03.680 import this type. But the completed
03:19:07.040 habits uh we don't want it to be a list
03:19:10.560 of strings like we were before. Before
03:19:12.640 we're just getting a list of the ids of
03:19:15.040 the habits that were completed. Instead
03:19:17.520 now we want to get the whole data of it.
03:19:19.760 So I'm going to actually make this be of
03:19:21.359 type habit completion. Now to get the
03:19:24.479 user we're going to say const user is
03:19:27.680 equal to use o like we did
03:19:30.279 before. Now perfect. And then we need to
03:19:33.520 get the different types. But the thing
03:19:35.359 is we don't need the logic for the uh
03:19:39.200 subscription on this screen. And the
03:19:41.520 reason for that is because this screen
03:19:44.239 this doesn't matter because we're not
03:19:45.840 interacting on the streak screen. We're
03:19:47.520 not doing anything uh to change the data
03:19:50.000 of the habits or the completions, right?
03:19:52.399 We're not deleting habits or completing
03:19:53.920 habits on the streak screen. That's just
03:19:55.600 to display data. So we want to delete
03:19:57.920 all of this logic over here. We'll
03:20:00.640 delete this as well. We're just going to
03:20:02.960 fetch the habits and the completions in
03:20:06.880 the use effect. So I'll delete this over
03:20:09.680 here. We don't need to return or clean
03:20:11.200 up any subscriptions. And in the we're
03:20:13.840 actually not going to just fetch today's
03:20:15.520 completions. We want to fetch all of the
03:20:17.120 completions. So I'm going to change the
03:20:18.720 name of this function to fetch
03:20:21.239 completions. And on the function over
03:20:24.080 here, we'll have to change the name. And
03:20:26.319 we'll need to change this query a bit
03:20:28.000 because this was just fetching which uh
03:20:30.319 habits were completed for a specific
03:20:32.000 user in today, right? In a specific day
03:20:34.479 or time frame. Now, we don't need this
03:20:37.120 anymore. So, I'm going to delete this.
03:20:39.600 And I want to import all of the apprite
03:20:42.720 stuff. So, I'll import databases. I'll
03:20:44.640 import database ID and completion ID and
03:20:48.640 query as well. But instead of fetching
03:20:52.080 for when the completed is greater than
03:20:54.160 or equal to today, we'll delete that.
03:20:56.399 We'll just get all of the completed
03:20:57.840 habits by the user no matter which day
03:21:00.000 they were completed at. And in the end,
03:21:02.319 I want to set the completed habits to be
03:21:05.600 equal to the completions, not a list of
03:21:08.560 the completed the completion IDs. Uh
03:21:11.520 we'll put the whole completion data
03:21:13.359 inside of here. Perfect. Now, for the
03:21:16.080 habits, uh I think this should pretty
03:21:18.399 much be the same. We don't need to
03:21:19.760 change anything. We just have to import
03:21:21.120 the habit collection ID and we should be
03:21:23.520 good to go. Now in this tricks uh
03:21:25.840 screen, we have the habits and the
03:21:27.600 completed habits arrays and those are
03:21:30.080 filled with the correct data. Now what
03:21:32.319 are we going to start with? Well, let's
03:21:33.840 start with the data that we want to
03:21:36.319 display in our screen for the different
03:21:39.840 habits that were completed. So we're
03:21:41.920 going to have two parts of the screen.
03:21:43.120 If you remember from the from the demo,
03:21:44.880 we're going to have the top over here,
03:21:45.920 which is going to show a rank of the
03:21:47.359 habits that were completed the most. At
03:21:49.439 the bottom, we'll show as well each
03:21:51.200 individual habit and the current streak
03:21:53.279 for it. So, we'll start with the bottom
03:21:55.120 part first, just because it will help us
03:21:57.120 set up for what we need for when we make
03:21:59.040 the top part. So, to do that, I'm going
03:22:01.200 to first just change this to say habit
03:22:05.080 streaks. Just have a nice title title.
03:22:08.080 And then below
03:22:09.720 this, I want to rank the habits. So I'm
03:22:14.399 going to create a function at the top
03:22:17.359 here. Actually, let's just make it below
03:22:19.359 the fetch completion stuff. And I'm
03:22:21.279 going to make this function called get
03:22:24.000 streak data. What this function is going
03:22:26.800 to do is it's going to take a habit ID.
03:22:29.279 And for each habit, it is going to
03:22:32.239 return back the streak for that habit,
03:22:35.040 the best streak for this habit, and the
03:22:37.439 total amount that we have for that habit
03:22:39.760 as well. So in order to do that, we need
03:22:42.720 both the data for the habit itself, but
03:22:46.640 also for all of the times you completed
03:22:49.120 this habit. So we know what was the mo
03:22:51.040 the biggest sequence in which you were
03:22:53.120 completing this habit. Uh so we detect
03:22:55.200 the best streak and the current streak.
03:22:57.520 So the first thing we need to do is we
03:22:59.279 need to get all of the completions for
03:23:00.960 this habit sorted by the date. So we
03:23:04.080 have the habit completions or the uh we
03:23:07.279 have the completions array. So I'm going
03:23:08.640 to call create an array here called
03:23:10.399 habit completions and we're going to set
03:23:12.960 it equal to completed habits dot filter.
03:23:17.359 We're going to filter for each habit
03:23:19.840 with an ID equal to this habit ID. So we
03:23:23.760 only keep the habits that has this ID
03:23:27.439 because remember the completions uh
03:23:29.200 array will will include every single
03:23:31.040 habit that was ever completed. And since
03:23:33.040 this function we want to return the data
03:23:35.040 for each habit, we need to first specify
03:23:37.920 which habit we're talking about. So I'll
03:23:40.160 say C, we only want to filter for when
03:23:42.720 the habit ID is equal to the habit ID of
03:23:47.600 the function.
03:23:49.279 Now when we filter for that now this
03:23:50.880 habit completions will only include this
03:23:53.040 habit inside of it and then we can use
03:23:55.520 the sort function from JavaScript to
03:23:58.160 sort it. Now we have to specify how we
03:24:00.000 want to sort this and the way I'm going
03:24:01.680 to do this is I want to sort it by date.
03:24:03.840 So the easiest way to do this is we have
03:24:05.600 a callback function over here which we
03:24:07.840 can use to compare. You can see even
03:24:09.359 here it shows you compare the first
03:24:11.920 habit which is habit A with the second
03:24:14.479 habit which is habit B. So we're going
03:24:17.120 to grab A and B. And the way we're
03:24:19.439 comparing them is based on the
03:24:22.160 difference in the date of when the habit
03:24:24.960 A and the habit B were completed. So
03:24:27.040 we'll say the new date and we'll pass
03:24:30.880 the completed at value for A dot get
03:24:36.920 time minus and then we'll put the same
03:24:40.640 thing but for B. And that difference is
03:24:43.359 what we sort the array for. And now we
03:24:47.439 have a list of the specific habit sorted
03:24:51.200 by the times in which they were
03:24:53.920 completed. Now we have to check to see
03:24:56.080 if this array is empty because if the
03:24:58.880 habit
03:24:59.880 completions.length is equal to
03:25:02.359 zero, then we just want to return
03:25:05.680 basically a default state to this
03:25:07.680 object. So what's going to happen is
03:25:09.600 this object over here let's just make a
03:25:11.920 simple interface here is going to be
03:25:13.760 called
03:25:15.080 streak data and what it's going to
03:25:18.239 return is it's going to return a streak
03:25:21.760 which is going to be a
03:25:23.479 number a best streak which is also going
03:25:27.439 to be a number and a total which again
03:25:30.880 it's going to be a number. So when we
03:25:33.760 return this we want to use that
03:25:36.160 interface and when we have an empty
03:25:38.560 state we basically want to return the
03:25:41.200 streak to be zero the best streak to be
03:25:45.279 zero as well and the total to be zero as
03:25:48.160 well. Now below this we now can assume
03:25:51.200 that habit completions is not empty and
03:25:53.520 we have the sorted array. Now what do we
03:25:56.000 do with it? Well, we build the streak
03:25:58.720 data at the end. We want to return uh
03:26:01.680 basically an array or an object that is
03:26:04.800 going to look like this. It's going to
03:26:06.080 return a variable called streak, a
03:26:07.760 variable called best streak, and a
03:26:09.200 variable called total. But we don't have
03:26:10.880 those yet. So, we have to build them.
03:26:12.960 So, let's write here build streak
03:26:18.120 data. So, we'll start with uh with
03:26:21.800 streak. We'll create a variable here.
03:26:24.000 Set it equal to zero initially. We'll
03:26:26.399 create a variable for best streak. We'll
03:26:30.399 set it to zero as well. And we'll make
03:26:32.560 one for total. Now total obviously it's
03:26:35.279 going to be the length of the habits
03:26:37.760 completion array because then it's the
03:26:39.840 total amount in which we completed this
03:26:41.760 habit. So we'll say habit
03:26:45.000 completions.length and this is already
03:26:46.800 going to be the total value. Now, in
03:26:49.680 order for us to generate the value for
03:26:52.960 streak and bad streak, we also need to
03:26:54.640 know the last date in which the user
03:26:56.960 completed it. So, we're going to say let
03:26:59.840 last date. We're going to set a type of
03:27:03.520 it to be a date or null because it will
03:27:06.399 start as
03:27:07.800 null and we'll have to calculate that.
03:27:10.439 And we also need to know the current
03:27:12.720 streak. So we'll say current
03:27:14.680 streak is equal to
03:27:19.000 zero. Perfect. Now for us to build this,
03:27:22.800 we have to loop through the habits
03:27:24.399 completion array and detect that
03:27:26.239 information and accumulate for each
03:27:28.479 individual habit. So we're going to say
03:27:30.399 habit completion dot for each and for
03:27:33.760 each habit we'll get the information of
03:27:36.880 it through this completion variable. Now
03:27:40.319 first let's get the date. So we're going
03:27:43.120 to say const date is equal to new
03:27:48.279 date. This is going to give us the date
03:27:51.439 of the completed at for this habit. So
03:27:53.920 we're going to say c do completed at.
03:27:57.680 Then we need to check to see if there is
03:28:00.080 a value for last date. Initially it's
03:28:02.560 no. But as we run through this uh habits
03:28:05.760 completion array as we iterate through
03:28:07.279 it we're going to change that value. So
03:28:09.920 if last date is not null. So if there
03:28:12.319 was a date in which uh the the habit was
03:28:14.960 last completed then we want to get the
03:28:17.640 difference in between the current date
03:28:20.800 of this habit and the last date. So
03:28:24.319 we're going to say diff is equal to um
03:28:29.720 date.get
03:28:31.800 time minus last date do get
03:28:38.200 time. And then we want to wrap this
03:28:42.080 around with some uh parenthesis so we
03:28:44.560 can actually divide it into an actual
03:28:48.720 format that we understand. So we'll
03:28:50.479 divide it by a,000 * 60 * 60 minutes or
03:28:56.080 time 24 hours. Now the reason why this
03:28:59.279 is still giving us error and it's saying
03:29:01.120 property get time doesn't doesn't exist
03:29:02.960 on type never is because we have like
03:29:05.680 even though we're assume we're asserting
03:29:07.600 here that last date is not null. Uh
03:29:10.720 Typescript knows that we never set last
03:29:12.399 day to anything right we set it to null
03:29:14.080 initially but we've never set it again.
03:29:16.000 Later on in this function we are going
03:29:17.920 to set it to something. So this error
03:29:19.680 will go away. So for now just ignore it.
03:29:22.399 Now when we have the difference in time
03:29:24.560 we want to check to see if the
03:29:26.439 difference is less than or equal to 1.5
03:29:30.399 because if it is then we want to
03:29:32.720 increase the streak by one. So we'll say
03:29:35.600 current streak plus or equal to one. Now
03:29:38.800 if it's not we just want to keep current
03:29:41.600 streak to be equal to one. We want to
03:29:43.600 initialize it to one. Now, if there's no
03:29:46.880 last date, right, and here's where we're
03:29:48.960 going to actually set a value for last
03:29:51.200 date. We want to check first to see if
03:29:54.399 the current streak is greater than the
03:29:57.359 best streak because if it is, then we
03:29:59.600 want to change the value for best streak
03:30:03.040 and set it equal to current
03:30:05.800 streak. Now, we updated that value. An
03:30:08.720 easy way to do this would also use the
03:30:10.239 min or ma max functions from math uh
03:30:13.200 which is a library you can access in in
03:30:15.200 JavaScript but I think this way is also
03:30:17.319 intuitive. Now if that's not the case
03:30:21.359 then we want to set the streak equal to
03:30:23.760 the current streak and we'll also set
03:30:26.880 the last date equal to the date and
03:30:30.399 you'll see that now last date is not
03:30:32.560 null and we can access the get time and
03:30:36.239 if all of this is successful in the end
03:30:39.359 we'll get back here uh the data we'll
03:30:42.160 have correctly filled out the data for
03:30:44.960 the habits uh for the street data. Now
03:30:47.840 one thing I just noticed is that it's
03:30:49.760 saying that total is not assignable
03:30:51.840 because if you look at how we define
03:30:53.600 total it assumes to have a completion
03:30:55.680 can be null. Now we can remove this
03:30:58.200 because we already assumed that it is
03:31:01.760 not undefined. Now the reason for that
03:31:04.080 is because when we come here to when we
03:31:06.560 set the states uh we didn't put an
03:31:08.960 initial value to it. We can pass an
03:31:10.880 empty array and now it will allow us to
03:31:15.040 uh pass empty values like for example
03:31:19.600 passing just the length without putting
03:31:21.200 a question mark in here and now total
03:31:23.760 will always be a number. Initially it
03:31:25.520 will be zero but as we filled it out
03:31:27.200 we'll update it. So perfect now we're
03:31:29.520 getting back the correct streak data.
03:31:31.200 Now why did we need this trick data?
03:31:32.960 because now we can create this ranking
03:31:36.800 variable which is going to rank the
03:31:38.960 habits based on its streak data. So I'll
03:31:41.600 do here const habit
03:31:44.920 streaks is equal to habits do map and I
03:31:48.399 want to map through each habit and rank
03:31:50.560 it by its best streak. So for each habit
03:31:55.040 we're going to get back the strict data
03:31:58.000 for that habit. So I'm going to say get
03:31:59.600 streak data and I'll pass the habit ID.
03:32:03.279 And like we know we're going to get the
03:32:04.880 streak, the best streak, and the total.
03:32:06.800 So streak, best streak, and
03:32:10.600 total. And what we're doing here is
03:32:13.680 we're going to
03:32:16.520 return
03:32:18.359 each value based on that. So what I
03:32:22.160 could do actually is I'll return here
03:32:24.399 the habit, the best streak, the streak,
03:32:28.960 and the total. Now you might think this
03:32:31.520 is kind of redundant because we're just
03:32:32.720 getting the streak data for each of them
03:32:34.399 that returning. Well, technically we are
03:32:36.560 getting the habit as as part of the
03:32:38.720 object that we're returning as well.
03:32:40.160 Something we didn't have access to in
03:32:41.840 the streak data. And now we have this
03:32:43.920 habits streaks and we can use that to
03:32:46.800 make the ranked habits because since we
03:32:50.800 know the information of each habit plus
03:32:54.160 their streak data, we can sort through
03:32:58.720 this habit streaks
03:33:00.680 array. And if you remember from what I
03:33:03.040 explained about the sort function, we
03:33:06.080 can compare different two different
03:33:08.960 values in this array based on the A and
03:33:11.760 B. And we put a condition in which we
03:33:13.680 want to compare them. And the comparison
03:33:15.439 we want to do here is we want to rank it
03:33:17.359 based on which habit had the be the
03:33:20.080 longest best streak. So it's a the best
03:33:23.920 streak minus b the best streak. And the
03:33:26.880 difference of that will rank some habits
03:33:29.040 higher than others. And now we have
03:33:32.080 this. We can console log this so you
03:33:34.880 guys can see if it's
03:33:36.279 working. And if I open this up. Wow. It
03:33:40.000 actually looks kind of weird. Wait, let
03:33:41.640 me just do a map here so we can see it
03:33:45.760 better. I'll map through this and I'm
03:33:48.399 going to map based on just
03:33:51.640 the habit dot and then I'll just get the
03:33:55.520 title so you guys can see. We know which
03:33:57.439 habit is the the best one. It's call an
03:34:00.640 old friend. We only have two of them,
03:34:02.080 right? So call an old friend should be
03:34:04.160 Yeah, as you can see it's at the top and
03:34:05.920 then meditate is at the bottom. Perfect.
03:34:08.560 So, we know uh it's correctly ranked.
03:34:11.279 Um, if I actually added a new habit
03:34:13.359 here, let's put drink one gallon of
03:34:18.279 water. Uh, drink a bunch of water. If we
03:34:23.600 add this, the streak will be zero. So,
03:34:27.120 it appears here. If I go to streaks
03:34:28.720 again, and this is not fetching every
03:34:31.840 time. So I technically can just do this
03:34:34.720 like comment something out, save it, it
03:34:36.880 will break and then come back and and
03:34:39.600 you see that uh the drink one gallon of
03:34:42.880 water doesn't even appear in the console
03:34:44.479 log because it's not a completed habit.
03:34:46.239 So it doesn't appear on this. But if I
03:34:48.800 were to go ahead and complete this and
03:34:51.600 now I open this up uh and I go back to
03:34:55.040 streaks then now we see drink one gallon
03:34:58.080 of water as one of the options over
03:34:59.680 here. Perfect. So let's remove this and
03:35:02.800 let's use the ranked habits um to
03:35:05.439 display the habits being ranked in the
03:35:07.439 UI. So below this uh text over here I
03:35:11.200 want to check to see if the
03:35:13.239 habits
03:35:14.760 do length is equal to zero because if it
03:35:19.359 is then this actual screen should just
03:35:22.640 show an empty state. I'm going to add
03:35:24.880 the same empty state we had here. So I'm
03:35:26.800 going to copy the empty state we put
03:35:29.680 here. Where is it? Yeah, it's this. I'll
03:35:32.239 put the exact same
03:35:33.640 thing and we should be good to go. I'll
03:35:36.720 obviously delete the style for now just
03:35:39.040 because we don't have those yet. We'll
03:35:41.760 save it. Now, we do have to pass an
03:35:44.239 alternative to this, which is going to
03:35:46.399 be us map mapping through the ranked
03:35:50.840 habits. And for each element, we're
03:35:54.960 going to return a card. Now a card is
03:35:58.000 going to be a a component that we can
03:36:01.120 get from React Native
03:36:03.319 paper. So I'll just return this for now.
03:36:06.000 We see the error goes away. But one
03:36:08.479 thing we need to do is we need to get
03:36:09.760 back since we're we're looping through
03:36:11.600 the ranked habits, we can get back a
03:36:13.279 bunch of stuff in this function. Uh so
03:36:15.520 we can get back the habit, the streak,
03:36:20.160 the best streak, and the total. We also
03:36:23.520 want to get back here the key for each
03:36:25.960 element. And in this uh card over here,
03:36:29.359 I'm going to again put the parenthesis.
03:36:31.600 I'm going to first pass the key to this
03:36:33.680 just so we can uh remove the annoying
03:36:36.080 warning that it gives us. And inside of
03:36:38.800 this card, I want to put a card dot
03:36:42.960 content. This is a type of a component
03:36:45.120 that we can put. And inside of it, I
03:36:47.760 want to put a text with the title of the
03:36:50.560 habit. So I'm going to say
03:36:52.359 text and then I'll put um the
03:36:57.640 habit.title. So now we now see each of
03:37:00.080 the streaks appearing in order. And now
03:37:02.080 we can see the streaks or the the habits
03:37:04.640 appearing in order. And then below this
03:37:07.200 I'm going to put another text that is
03:37:08.880 going to be the description. So I'm
03:37:10.399 going to say
03:37:13.560 habit.escription. Then we want to put
03:37:15.920 the view which we're going to show the
03:37:18.319 stats for this specific habit. So I'm
03:37:20.560 going to put view over here. And for the
03:37:24.000 first view, uh this is the stats row. So
03:37:27.920 if you think about it, they're going to
03:37:29.359 be three stats, one next to each other
03:37:31.600 on the same row. So I'm going to start
03:37:33.520 with the first one, which is going to be
03:37:35.359 the uh view for the uh current streak.
03:37:39.520 So I'm going to put here a view with a
03:37:43.720 text. And the first text is just going
03:37:46.399 to be the emoji for like fire. and the
03:37:53.479 streak. Perfect. Which all of them for
03:37:55.840 some reason all of them are zero. Then
03:37:58.399 uh we want to put another text which is
03:38:00.560 going to be the text for the best stre
03:38:04.319 uh actually no below this we'll just put
03:38:07.399 current. But then we'll copy this view
03:38:09.920 and we'll put two more. But this one is
03:38:13.439 going to be for the best trick. So,
03:38:15.120 we're going to do uh like a trophy and
03:38:17.920 we're going to change this to best
03:38:20.200 streak. And then we'll change this again
03:38:22.720 to
03:38:23.720 best. And then for the last one, we want
03:38:27.040 to put a like a check mark and we'll put
03:38:29.760 the total. And we'll change this to
03:38:32.160 total as well. And now we see the total
03:38:35.359 amount of streaks, the current streak,
03:38:37.840 and the best streak as well. Now,
03:38:40.479 technically, I haven't completed any of
03:38:43.359 these for multiple days in a row just
03:38:46.160 because of the way I'm recording this
03:38:47.760 video. So, you see that um the if you're
03:38:51.680 doing this all in one day, the value for
03:38:53.600 current and best will always be zero
03:38:55.520 because uh you haven't spent two days in
03:38:58.160 a row actually increasing the habits,
03:39:00.160 right? The the the completions. And I
03:39:02.160 know one of them says five, but that's
03:39:03.680 just because we we increased it to five
03:39:06.600 after we uh implemented the restriction
03:39:11.200 for this habit uh to be able to complete
03:39:13.600 twice on the same day. So now I want to
03:39:16.479 um continue building this part. We have
03:39:19.279 the information for the streaks and for
03:39:21.279 the total. Uh we can actually include
03:39:24.080 already some styling to this and I
03:39:26.640 probably want to do that. I want to
03:39:28.720 start with the style for this card
03:39:31.200 content over here before we continue
03:39:33.120 building the top part. For this section,
03:39:35.760 I want to first set a style which is
03:39:38.960 going to be let's call it
03:39:42.760 styles.habit habit title. Now, I do want
03:39:46.800 to put a stylesheet. So, I'm actually
03:39:48.239 going to just copy this, paste it down
03:39:51.840 here, and then just close this. And I
03:39:55.120 want to import the stylesheet from React
03:39:57.760 Native. So I'm going to go up here.
03:39:59.760 We're gonna import it from React Native.
03:40:02.080 I just realized the text that we
03:40:04.160 imported shouldn't be from React Native.
03:40:06.560 It should be from React Native paper. So
03:40:10.319 let's import it from React Native
03:40:13.000 paper. Which means that now uh in this
03:40:16.720 text we can use some of React Native uh
03:40:20.080 styling. For example, I can put a
03:40:22.640 variant to this. So, I'm going to put a
03:40:25.279 variant of title medium and we'll make
03:40:27.840 it a little bit bigger. I also want to
03:40:29.600 put a styling to this. So, I'll copy the
03:40:31.680 style here. And I'm going to call this
03:40:34.479 the actually this is the one that has to
03:40:36.800 have habit title card content. We don't
03:40:38.640 really need to style it at all. I'm
03:40:40.239 going to delete that. Now, on the
03:40:42.239 description, we're obviously going to
03:40:43.520 change this to habit
03:40:46.680 description. And on the view for the
03:40:49.920 stats, this is a row, right? They're
03:40:52.399 currently in a column. They're one on
03:40:53.760 top of each other, but we're going to
03:40:54.720 change the styling to that to show the
03:40:56.800 to become a row. So, I'm going to call
03:40:58.479 this the stats
03:41:00.120 row. Then, for each of the views here, I
03:41:04.239 want to actually set a background color
03:41:06.000 that is a bit different. So, the first
03:41:08.080 one is going to be just the this one,
03:41:10.640 the uh fire. So, we're going to call
03:41:12.960 this the uh we're going to call it stat
03:41:17.160 badge, and we'll make a version of it
03:41:19.760 for the the best streak, which is going
03:41:22.319 to be a golden version of it. So, I'm
03:41:24.000 going to call it stat badge gold, so we
03:41:26.000 know which is which. And for this one,
03:41:28.800 we're going to call it stat badge green.
03:41:31.600 And the color here is just so we
03:41:33.279 differentiate what we're going to set
03:41:34.319 the background color to. Now, for each
03:41:36.720 of them, we want to basically use the
03:41:38.640 same style. Uh, so we're going to call
03:41:40.319 it
03:41:41.399 stat badge
03:41:44.040 text. And for the bottom thing, we're
03:41:47.680 going to call it a label. So stat
03:41:52.279 label. And we'll copy the same thing and
03:41:55.520 paste it on on this and on this. And
03:41:59.200 I'll copy this as well and paste it on
03:42:02.040 this and on this. Perfect. Now, let's
03:42:05.920 create the actual styles. So, I'm going
03:42:07.840 to come here to the stylesheet and we'll
03:42:09.920 start with the title. The title is just
03:42:12.319 going to have a font weight of
03:42:15.560 bold and the margin bottom of
03:42:21.560 16. Then, we're want to set a card type,
03:42:25.840 which we actually didn't set a style
03:42:29.520 for. So I'm going to actually copy this
03:42:32.239 and I'm going to set here not for the
03:42:35.359 card content for the card we want to
03:42:37.520 actually set. So for this uh card type I
03:42:40.720 actually want to pass two styles. I want
03:42:42.319 to pass the first style which we're
03:42:43.680 going to call it the
03:42:45.239 styles.card which is just for every
03:42:47.120 single card they have the same style.
03:42:48.800 But the second one is I want to
03:42:50.560 implement a different styling depending
03:42:52.560 if it's the first card because the first
03:42:54.479 card is the card with the best streak.
03:42:57.359 Right? So the way we're going to do this
03:42:59.920 is we're going to detect to see if the
03:43:03.000 index or the key actually of this car of
03:43:07.600 this habit is equal to zero it means
03:43:10.319 it's the the card at the top which is
03:43:13.040 the best street card and if that's true
03:43:15.920 then I also want to implement another
03:43:18.520 style called first card. So there's
03:43:22.479 those are both styles that we want to
03:43:24.000 create. So we'll come down here and
03:43:26.560 we'll implement for the card we're going
03:43:28.399 to put a margin bottom of 18, a border
03:43:35.800 radius of uh 18 as well. And oh, I just
03:43:40.640 realized we're doing this inside of the
03:43:42.479 title, which by the way, the title we
03:43:46.000 should this style is actually not for
03:43:48.239 the habit title. It's for this title up
03:43:50.399 at the top over here. So we have to
03:43:52.000 implement it as well.
03:43:53.840 Uh so that's why it appears like that.
03:43:55.840 Also let's put a a styling for this
03:43:57.439 view. Let's call it
03:44:00.040 container. And container you guys know
03:44:02.479 is going to be
03:44:03.880 the like it's it's all almost always the
03:44:06.880 same. It's just a flax of one. A
03:44:10.720 background color to be the color that
03:44:13.520 we've been using all the time. So it's
03:44:16.399 going to be the
03:44:18.279 F5 F5 F5.
03:44:21.680 And then we also want to put a padding
03:44:23.920 of
03:44:25.319 16. Perfect. And then let's put a comma
03:44:28.239 on this. And everything should be fine.
03:44:30.640 Now on the card, let's continue building
03:44:32.800 this. I want to put a different
03:44:34.160 background
03:44:36.520 color. Uh we're going to make it be #
03:44:41.319 fff. Then we'll make an elevation of
03:44:44.479 three.
03:44:46.239 We're going to put the shadow
03:44:49.720 collar to be
03:44:54.760 #000000. Then for the shadow offset,
03:44:59.760 we're going to set a object with a width
03:45:03.680 of zero and a height of two. So we have
03:45:06.560 more control over the shadow. And we'll
03:45:09.199 set a shadow opacity to be equal to
03:45:12.600 0.08. So it's very minimal.
03:45:15.600 Now after that we want to set a shadow
03:45:18.520 radius to be equal to 8. We want to set
03:45:22.160 a
03:45:23.080 border width to be equal to 1. And we'll
03:45:27.040 set a border color to be equal to # f0
03:45:32.239 f0 f0. Perfect. This is the styling I
03:45:35.520 want for each of the habits. Now, below
03:45:38.640 this, like I said, we now detect which
03:45:41.760 is the habit that appears at the top,
03:45:43.199 which by the way, I don't know if you've
03:45:44.720 noticed already, since all of the the
03:45:47.439 streaks are at zero, even the current
03:45:49.920 and the best. Um, it really isn't
03:45:52.640 sorted. But I have another version of
03:45:54.800 this app, which is the one I built
03:45:56.399 before recording this video, which I
03:45:58.000 actually did complete the streaks. It's
03:45:59.520 the same code, but I did complete the
03:46:00.880 streaks multiple times so you guys will
03:46:02.720 see a better uh idea of how this is
03:46:04.800 going to look like when you use the app
03:46:06.479 multiple days in a row. So, we just
03:46:09.279 wanted to highlight the first card so
03:46:12.560 it's very clear to the user which one is
03:46:14.399 the best one. So, we're going to say
03:46:16.239 first
03:46:17.160 card, we'll set a border width to be two
03:46:21.040 and we'll set a border color to be this
03:46:23.439 purple color. So we'll set 7 C 4 D FFF
03:46:30.080 and this will be kind of like this
03:46:31.439 purple shadow to it. Now below this,
03:46:35.359 let's set the styling for the stuff
03:46:37.680 inside of the card. So we'll start with
03:46:39.760 the habit title. This will have a font
03:46:43.199 weight of
03:46:45.239 bold. Then we're going to use the font
03:46:48.680 size of um
03:46:51.640 18. And let's put a margin
03:46:56.120 bottom of two. Perfect. Now for the uh
03:47:01.680 habit description, I'll copy this and
03:47:04.560 I'll just call it
03:47:06.680 description. We want to not set a font
03:47:09.600 weight or a font size. We want to set a
03:47:13.439 color of it. So I'm going to set a color
03:47:15.120 to be
03:47:17.960 #606c 80. So, it's kind of like again
03:47:20.960 that little grayish color. The margin
03:47:23.760 bottom, we can make it a little bit
03:47:24.960 bigger. We'll make it eight. So, there's
03:47:26.479 more space. Not 28, eight. Now, below
03:47:29.920 this, let's make the row. So, this stuff
03:47:32.239 appears one next to each other. One
03:47:34.239 here, one here, and one here. So, I'm
03:47:36.319 going to call this stats row. And to do
03:47:39.439 that, we'll just set the flex direction
03:47:42.640 to be
03:47:44.439 row. Then now they're next to each
03:47:47.040 other, but we need to put a space in
03:47:49.120 between them. So I'm going to justify
03:47:50.479 the content to space
03:47:53.000 between. Now we'll set the margin bottom
03:47:56.720 to be 12 and the margin top to be
03:48:01.880 eight. Now below this, let's set the
03:48:05.120 stat badge, which is the styling for the
03:48:07.840 first one, the the little fire over
03:48:10.720 here. So most of them are going to be
03:48:12.800 pretty much the same. We want to first
03:48:14.880 set a background color. So I'll just
03:48:17.120 copy this. I'll paste it here. And the
03:48:19.600 background color for this one is going
03:48:21.520 to be F
03:48:23.720 FFF 3 E0. So it's kind of like an orange
03:48:28.199 color. Now below this, we want to put a
03:48:31.680 border radius of
03:48:34.199 10. We want to put a padding horizontal
03:48:38.800 of 12. a padding vertical of six. And we
03:48:44.560 want to align the items to the
03:48:48.680 center. And then below this, we'll just
03:48:51.120 set a minimum width of it to be
03:48:54.120 60. Now, we can copy this and put it two
03:48:58.160 more times, but we'll change this to be
03:49:00.160 the stat badge gold and the stat badge
03:49:03.279 green because the stylings are pretty
03:49:05.359 much the same, but the difference is
03:49:06.479 going to be just the size of it and also
03:49:08.880 the color. So for the gold, we want to
03:49:11.120 put a golden color. So the style will be
03:49:13.960 FFF D E7. And you see it's kind of an a
03:49:17.920 yellow instead of an orange. Now for
03:49:19.760 this one, again, it's going to be a bit
03:49:21.760 different. It's going to be
03:49:24.040 E8F
03:49:25.800 5E9 to give it a green look. Now we can
03:49:29.279 go down here and we can add a stat badge
03:49:33.960 text because it's for the first text
03:49:37.439 that appears over here in each of the
03:49:39.199 elements. And for that we're just going
03:49:40.880 to put a font weight of
03:49:43.720 bold. Then we're going to set a font
03:49:47.359 size to be
03:49:49.399 15. And then we're going to set a color
03:49:52.399 to be hashtag
03:49:54.760 2222 3B.
03:49:57.680 Perfect. Now, below this, we want to
03:50:00.640 actually put a label. So, the styling
03:50:02.640 for the label, which will include the
03:50:04.800 margin between the label and the text
03:50:07.520 because it doesn't it looks kind of
03:50:09.279 close to each other. So, we're going to
03:50:10.880 call this stat
03:50:12.600 label. And in here, we don't want to
03:50:15.520 make it be a bold text. We want the font
03:50:18.960 size, which I just realized we already
03:50:20.800 have style here. Uh, I want it to be 11.
03:50:23.359 So, a little bit smaller than the top
03:50:24.800 one. But also I want to set the color to
03:50:27.760 be 888. And I want to set a margin top
03:50:32.000 to be two. Now the font weight even
03:50:34.160 though we don't want it to be bold, we
03:50:35.920 can set a specific value to it. And I'll
03:50:37.920 set 500 cuz I think it looks better this
03:50:40.640 way. Now this is the style for each
03:50:43.199 individual habit streak. Now the thing
03:50:45.760 is uh first first and foremost when we
03:50:48.720 have uh the habits here we let me add a
03:50:52.080 couple other habits. I'm going to add
03:50:53.520 here the uh let's think about it. What
03:50:56.000 habit I want to add? Probably I'll just
03:50:58.880 do the workout because it's one that I
03:51:00.800 haven't added. So workout 5 days a week.
03:51:04.880 We're going to make this weekly and it
03:51:07.040 appears here. And I also probably want
03:51:11.279 to actually yeah I probably want to
03:51:13.040 increase the I want to run the the same
03:51:16.160 kind of subscription ran here. I know I
03:51:18.239 deleted it, but I I realize now that it
03:51:20.479 should probably be included here if you
03:51:21.920 want everything to appear automatically.
03:51:24.080 So, yeah, I'll copy this logic
03:51:26.920 here. And it's it's going to be quick
03:51:29.439 for us to add it. I'll just put it above
03:51:32.439 this. I'll change this to fetch
03:51:36.359 completions. And I'll have to import the
03:51:39.040 client and I'll have to import the
03:51:40.880 real-time
03:51:42.120 response. Um, pretty much the rest is
03:51:45.199 the same. The only thing we need to do
03:51:46.720 now is we have to return
03:51:50.399 uh obviously the cleanup function which
03:51:53.040 is just going to call the habits
03:51:55.680 uh no the is it the habit subscription
03:51:58.399 yeah habits subscription and it's going
03:52:01.600 to call the completion subscription
03:52:04.479 perfect so now we know that uh it will
03:52:07.600 include this but this is why I wanted to
03:52:10.080 to add this so I showed you guys I want
03:52:12.239 to make this scrollable because it is
03:52:14.000 not scrollable right now Right? And uh
03:52:16.800 things can just be messed up if they
03:52:18.640 appear at the bottom here. So to make it
03:52:20.560 scrollable, I'm going to come to the
03:52:23.199 streaks view. Right? And in here, right
03:52:26.479 when we have the ranked habits, I
03:52:28.720 actually want to put a scroll view
03:52:30.800 around this. Similar to what we did on
03:52:33.279 the um on the other component, I want to
03:52:36.560 put a scroll view here. Now, and now I
03:52:39.600 need to wrap this around with uh with
03:52:42.000 some curly braces so that this is actual
03:52:44.279 JavaScript. And we can Oh, I'm not in
03:52:46.880 the right screen. We can now scroll
03:52:48.640 through this. But I do want to put a I
03:52:51.520 want to remove the vertical, right? So,
03:52:53.840 show vertical scroll indicator. I want
03:52:56.080 to set it to false like we did on the
03:52:58.560 other screen. And perfect. Now, I do
03:53:01.359 want to put as well the
03:53:03.840 uh container. Actually, I want to swap
03:53:05.760 this. I want to put this to be over
03:53:08.199 here. Yeah. So, it's it's it's not
03:53:11.199 cluttered at the side. And it looks
03:53:13.359 pretty nice now. Yeah. I like this.
03:53:15.479 Perfect. So, now we can scroll through
03:53:18.160 this and we can see all of the things.
03:53:20.399 But how do we show the ranking of the
03:53:23.600 habits at the top? It's the top part,
03:53:25.840 right? So, that's why I made the scroll
03:53:27.439 view be just the loop of the ranked
03:53:29.520 habits because we're going to have
03:53:30.960 something above it. Now, how do we uh
03:53:33.359 display that information? Well, above
03:53:35.600 the habits.length equal to zero, we want
03:53:38.479 to include that view. So, I'm going to
03:53:41.199 put here if the ranked habits array is
03:53:45.040 not zero. So, if it's greater than
03:53:47.399 zero, then let's display this view. This
03:53:52.080 view is going to be kind of like a
03:53:54.399 table. We're going to style it to look
03:53:56.000 like a table later, but for now, we'll
03:53:57.520 keep it like this. We'll put a text
03:54:00.000 which again is the one from React Native
03:54:01.840 paper which will show this little emoji
03:54:05.920 um for like a metal and it will say top
03:54:10.520 streaks. Uh it should appear at the top
03:54:13.040 here but I just realized that we didn't
03:54:15.520 put a dot length here. Perfect. Yeah.
03:54:19.040 Then below this we want to put we want
03:54:22.000 to loop through the ranked habits and
03:54:24.160 only show the top three habits. So we'll
03:54:28.720 put here ranked habits. We're going to
03:54:31.439 slice this array. Just show the first
03:54:34.000 three. And for each of them, we're going
03:54:36.000 to map and grab each habit and their
03:54:39.800 key. And for each habit, we want to
03:54:42.319 return a
03:54:45.239 view. Now we'll set the key of the view
03:54:47.920 to be equal to the key of the um array.
03:54:51.199 And for each habit, I want to uh display
03:54:55.680 some information about it. For example,
03:54:57.920 uh I pretty much want to display
03:55:00.199 the badge. So like we'll have three
03:55:03.439 different types of badges that we want
03:55:05.600 to include. Um and depending on which
03:55:08.960 kind of badge we want to use, we'll put
03:55:11.920 it over here. So the first uh item will
03:55:16.800 have a specific styling. The second item
03:55:18.800 will have another specific styling. And
03:55:20.960 the third one will have a different one
03:55:22.800 as well. just so we can clearly
03:55:24.479 differentiate who's number one, number
03:55:25.920 two, and number three. So, we'll make
03:55:27.520 here uh an array called badge
03:55:31.080 styles. And we're gonna add a style for
03:55:35.840 the badge first place, the badge second
03:55:38.880 place, and the badge third
03:55:40.680 place. So, we'll do badge two, and badge
03:55:44.560 three.
03:55:46.000 And the way we differentiate them is on
03:55:48.239 the style of this uh not for the this
03:55:51.600 view but for the we're going to put a
03:55:53.520 view below
03:55:54.840 this we want to pass uh actually let me
03:55:59.680 just complete this view. We want to pass
03:56:01.520 a style object here and we'll pass an
03:56:03.880 array which is going to include the
03:56:06.800 generic style for the ranking
03:56:10.199 badge but also we're going to get the
03:56:13.760 individual styling based on which item
03:56:17.199 we are talking about. So the index of
03:56:18.960 the array if it's zero we'll get the
03:56:20.960 badge for the first place. If it's sec
03:56:23.279 uh one we'll get it for the second and
03:56:24.960 if it's two we'll get it for the third
03:56:26.479 place.
03:56:28.359 Now, inside of this view, we're all
03:56:30.880 we're going to do is just put the
03:56:33.359 ranking of it. So, we'll put a text
03:56:35.840 here. And the ranking is going to be if
03:56:38.800 it's first place, second or third. Now,
03:56:40.800 the way we know if it's first, second,
03:56:42.160 or third is by using the key because
03:56:44.479 keys is like the index of the item in
03:56:46.880 the array. Right? So, uh if you know
03:56:49.680 anything about arrays in computer
03:56:51.359 science, they're actually they start
03:56:52.800 from zero. So we do have to increase it
03:56:54.720 by one so that it shows 1 2 3 instead of
03:56:58.000 0 1 and two. Perfect. We're now
03:57:00.399 displaying them in the screen. Now below
03:57:02.800 this view I want to put another text and
03:57:05.439 this will just show the title of the
03:57:06.800 habit. So I'm going to say
03:57:10.600 item.habit.title. And then below this
03:57:12.800 I'll then put the best streak of this
03:57:15.040 habit. So I'm going to say item dot best
03:57:20.760 streak. Perfect. Now all of them
03:57:23.840 obviously have the streak of zero again
03:57:25.760 but uh that's beyond the fact. So now we
03:57:29.120 have successfully made this this section
03:57:31.600 but it doesn't look like what you guys
03:57:32.960 saw in the demo. Well all of that was
03:57:34.800 done with styling. So we're going to add
03:57:37.600 some styles to this. I want to add a
03:57:40.000 style for the total view here. So we're
03:57:42.399 going to put style and we're going to
03:57:44.319 call this the ranking component or the
03:57:47.040 ranking container. So let's say ranking
03:57:49.520 container.
03:57:51.760 Then I want to put one for these text.
03:57:54.160 We're going to call it the ranking
03:57:57.560 title. Uh one for this one. We're going
03:58:00.319 to call it the ranking
03:58:03.800 row.
03:58:05.800 And we already have one for this view,
03:58:08.560 but we need one for the text. We're
03:58:10.239 going to call it the
03:58:12.439 ranking badge
03:58:15.239 text. And then for this two, we're just
03:58:18.960 going to call it the ranking
03:58:21.960 habit and the ranking
03:58:26.760 streak. Then let's go actually let me
03:58:29.680 also add on this text over here. I
03:58:33.359 forgot. Let's put a variant to this.
03:58:35.279 Let's make it headline
03:58:37.399 small. So it's a little bit bigger even
03:58:40.000 though it says small. Just that we now
03:58:41.840 made it into a headline. Perfect. Now
03:58:45.199 let's go down here and let's add the
03:58:47.279 stylings that we just added. So we'll go
03:58:49.600 down here. We'll go to below stat label
03:58:51.439 and let's add a ranking container. This
03:58:55.120 ranking container is going to be what's
03:58:57.439 going to have a margin
03:58:59.800 bottom which is going to be 24. So
03:59:02.960 there's some space in between the the
03:59:05.199 ranking and the bottom list. Then we'll
03:59:08.000 put a background
03:59:09.720 color which is going to be pretty much
03:59:12.640 just white. So
03:59:15.080 fff. Then we're going to have a border
03:59:18.640 radius of
03:59:21.239 16. Which matches the padding that is
03:59:24.160 also going to be
03:59:25.560 16. And then below this, we'll put a
03:59:28.000 shadow color. Actually, I'll just copy.
03:59:29.920 We just have a styling similar to this,
03:59:31.840 right? Uh which one is it? It's this
03:59:33.920 one. I'm going to call copy all of this.
03:59:36.800 And I'm just going to paste it
03:59:39.560 here. Perfect. Now the only change is I
03:59:43.040 want to change the elevation of this to
03:59:45.600 be two instead of three. The shadow
03:59:48.080 quality should be the same. The shadow
03:59:49.760 offset the same padding as well.
03:59:51.439 Everything the same. Uh I don't want to
03:59:53.680 put a border width on this. So I'm going
03:59:56.479 to remove this. Perfect. And I also
03:59:59.680 don't want to put a border color cuz
04:00:00.880 that's I didn't put a border width. Now
04:00:03.439 below this we're going to put a ranking
04:00:05.319 title. And I know it's kind of big but
04:00:07.760 it's because uh they're going to appear
04:00:09.760 on top of each other. But the individual
04:00:11.760 items should be right next to each
04:00:13.199 other. Right? It shouldn't be one and
04:00:15.040 then meditate which is the title of the
04:00:16.720 habit shouldn't appear below. It should
04:00:18.399 appear next to it. So for the ranking
04:00:20.479 title, we're going to put um a font
04:00:23.680 weight to be bold so the top streaks
04:00:26.319 look
04:00:27.479 better. Then below this, we'll put a
04:00:30.399 font size to be 18 so it's
04:00:32.439 bigger. Then margin bottom to be 12.
04:00:37.920 Then color, we're going to set it to be
04:00:43.640 #7c4dfff. So it's kind of purple. And
04:00:46.399 then we can actually put some letter
04:00:48.279 spacing. It will look a lot better with
04:00:50.399 this. Now below this, we want to put the
04:00:54.239 ranking row so things don't look too
04:00:56.319 cluttered and on top of each other. The
04:00:58.399 way we do this is, as always, we set a
04:01:00.319 flex direction to
04:01:01.880 row. And then I want to align the items
04:01:05.680 to the center cuz they're all in the
04:01:07.359 left. So I'm going to say
04:01:09.239 center. And then I want to put a margin
04:01:14.040 bottom to be
04:01:16.439 eight. I want to put a border bottom
04:01:21.120 width to be equal to one. And the reason
04:01:23.359 why I'm doing this is so that it looks
04:01:24.720 like a list, right? And then I want to
04:01:27.359 put a color to it. I'm going to make it
04:01:28.720 kind of um grayish. So, I'm going to say
04:01:35.399 hashtagf. And then below this, I'll just
04:01:38.399 put a padding bottom of eight. Perfect.
04:01:43.040 Now, it actually looks like a
04:01:45.160 list. I'm so tired,
04:01:47.960 bro. Then below this, let's put a
04:01:50.920 ranking
04:01:53.399 badge. We'll set it the width to be 28.
04:01:58.479 Then we'll set the height to be 28 as
04:02:02.000 well. We'll set the border radius to be
04:02:07.560 14. We'll set the align items to be
04:02:12.600 center. Justify
04:02:15.560 uh so justify content to be
04:02:19.720 center. And we're also putting a margin
04:02:23.560 right to be 10 and a
04:02:26.439 background color to be E 0 E 0 E is Z.
04:02:32.399 Perfect. Now I need to change this to
04:02:34.080 height. And now it looks like a circle.
04:02:36.359 Perfect. Now this ranking badge is
04:02:39.120 applied to each of them. But remember we
04:02:41.279 made specific styling for the different
04:02:44.000 positions in this list. We made a r a
04:02:47.120 badge one, a badge two, and a badge
04:02:48.800 three. and it will change the color
04:02:50.640 based on it. So I want to do this. The
04:02:53.120 badge one is going to have a background
04:02:56.520 color of gold because they just they're
04:03:00.160 number one. So I'm going to put
04:03:02.120 FFD 700. This is
04:03:07.239 gold. Perfect. And you see it's kind of
04:03:09.680 yellow. Then I'll copy this and I'll
04:03:12.479 make badge two. It's not going to be
04:03:14.560 gold. It's going to be silver. So I'm
04:03:16.720 going to put a silver color. C 0 C 0 C 0
04:03:20.720 And I'll change this to
04:03:23.160 silver. And then finally, let's make the
04:03:28.600 bronze, which is going to be badge
04:03:32.439 3, and it's going to be CD
04:03:36.760 7F
04:03:38.279 3D2. And it will look kind of bronze.
04:03:41.760 Now, below this, let's just add the
04:03:43.760 styling for the ranking badge text.
04:03:48.560 It's going to have a font weight of
04:03:52.120 bold. It's going to have a color of #
04:03:56.279 fff and a font size of
04:03:59.960 15. So it looks white and it's a little
04:04:02.640 bit bigger. It looks a lot better in my
04:04:04.640 opinion. Now we do have to apply some
04:04:06.080 styling to differentiate this streak and
04:04:08.319 the actual title of the habit. So the
04:04:11.199 ranking
04:04:12.600 habit will have a flex of
04:04:16.040 one and then it will have a font size of
04:04:20.520 15 apply to the whole thing. And we're
04:04:24.399 also going to have a color of
04:04:27.680 #
04:04:28.920 333 and a font
04:04:32.359 weight of 600.
04:04:36.920 Then individually
04:04:39.640 the ranking
04:04:42.760 streak is going to have a font
04:04:45.479 size of
04:04:47.399 14, a color of
04:04:51.960 #7c 4D
04:04:55.000 fff. And we want to put a font weight of
04:04:58.080 bold cuz it's it's purple so it's kind
04:05:00.479 of hard to see. So making it bold will
04:05:02.640 make it easier to see. Now, finally,
04:05:04.720 we're pretty much done with this screen.
04:05:07.920 You can see we can swipe between this
04:05:10.000 and we have the top habit streaks at the
04:05:12.080 top. Uh, and it looks pretty nice,
04:05:14.800 right? We can uh complete different
04:05:17.600 workout, different habits. They now
04:05:19.680 appear here, see automatically. And if I
04:05:24.160 were to actually record this video and
04:05:26.479 complete stuff day after day in a
04:05:28.399 sequence, you would see that we would
04:05:30.000 actually get the information for the
04:05:31.520 streaks. Now, one thing I just noticed
04:05:33.680 is that even though uh we haven't
04:05:36.720 completed stuff in multiple times in a
04:05:38.720 row, uh we should get the values for the
04:05:42.560 current to be at least one cuz we are
04:05:44.560 completing the streaks, right? We we're
04:05:46.640 not registering this correctly. And I
04:05:48.479 just noted that it is because on this if
04:05:51.199 else statement over here, you know how
04:05:53.520 we have this else statement here? This
04:05:56.960 is actually incorrect. The else
04:05:59.199 statement shouldn't be wrapping the
04:06:01.920 around this whole last date um property.
04:06:05.520 It should actually be wrapping around uh
04:06:08.479 we setting the current
04:06:11.000 streak equal to
04:06:13.399 one. And now you'll see that this stuff
04:06:15.760 will update. Now it's still only one.
04:06:18.800 That's the only actually the current
04:06:21.279 this the calling an old friend. Oh yeah,
04:06:23.840 it's detecting the best streak. Uh yeah
04:06:26.800 so that should appear first. Now uh even
04:06:29.279 though the work the current uh values
04:06:31.680 are proper you can see that the colon
04:06:33.760 old friend is appearing at last. Now the
04:06:36.560 way we fix that is actually on this um
04:06:40.000 sort for the ranked habits. We just have
04:06:42.160 to switch the order to be reversed. So
04:06:44.800 we compare B to A instead of A to B. And
04:06:47.680 you'll see that now calling old friend
04:06:49.600 is at the top and it is the top habit.
04:06:52.239 Perfect. I don't even have to show you
04:06:53.840 guys my other um version of this app
04:06:56.640 that has an actual winner. Uh this
04:06:59.439 clearly shows that calling old friend is
04:07:00.960 the habit that has the best streak. Now
04:07:03.040 we have successfully built this app and
04:07:06.000 I know it it took a while and it is a
04:07:08.800 simple app. However, I hope that this
04:07:10.960 has taught you guys a lot about React
04:07:13.120 Native and how to integrate uh integrate
04:07:15.199 React Native in a full stack way. I will
04:07:18.319 also include a link to the part of this
04:07:22.640 rep. So a different branch of this
04:07:24.640 repository for this project in which I
04:07:27.359 actually took this project and I
04:07:30.000 implemented a lot of very specific best
04:07:32.239 practices for you to how to divide your
04:07:34.479 code, you know, make it look um just
04:07:37.439 organize it better using uh some
04:07:39.600 libraries that I think could improve the
04:07:41.199 code and so on. So, if you're interested
04:07:43.120 in that, I don't think it would be um
04:07:45.600 that important for this video just
04:07:47.120 because this video is React Native
04:07:48.880 specific and this changes I'm going to
04:07:51.279 make are actual changes that are just
04:07:53.760 generally React um instead of being
04:07:56.720 something specific for React Native. So,
04:07:58.479 if you want to see this project, but
04:07:59.840 also uh a version of it in which the
04:08:02.000 code is following more best practices
04:08:03.840 and being more organized, feel free to
04:08:05.760 check the code in the description.
04:08:08.080 Again, if you want to check out my new
04:08:09.680 React course for beginners, it doesn't
04:08:11.840 include React Native, but I am preparing
04:08:13.600 a React Native course. Um, feel free to
04:08:16.080 go and click the link in the description
04:08:18.000 and check it out. We do have PPP
04:08:20.080 pricing, which is a thing everyone
04:08:22.160 started asking me about. Um, and we have
04:08:24.479 implemented that. So, if you want to
04:08:25.920 check that out and buy it in your own
04:08:27.840 currency with adaptive pricing depending
04:08:30.560 on how much your currency can afford, of
04:08:33.359 course, feel free to check the link in
04:08:34.800 the description and I'll be really happy
04:08:36.399 to have you guys enroll in the course.
04:08:38.640 And yeah, that's that's basically it.
04:08:40.319 Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thank
04:08:41.920 you so much for watching and I see you
04:08:43.680 guys next time.

CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/(auth)/sign-in
CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/(auth)/sign-up
CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding
```

#### **Clerk Provider Setup (app/_layout.tsx)**
```tsx
import { ClerkProvider, ClerkLoaded } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import { tokenCache } from '@/lib/auth/token-cache';

const publishableKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!;

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      publishableKey={publishableKey}
      tokenCache={tokenCache}
    >
      <ClerkLoaded>
        <AuthenticationGuard>
          <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }} />
        </AuthenticationGuard>
      </ClerkLoaded>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

### **2. Authentication Screens Implementation**

#### **Sign Up Screen (app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx)**
```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Alert } from 'react-native';
import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import { router } from 'expo-router';

export default function SignUpScreen() {
  const { isLoaded, signUp, setActive } = useSignUp();
  const [emailAddress, setEmailAddress] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [pendingVerification, setPendingVerification] = useState(false);
  const [code, setCode] = useState('');

  // Create account with email verification
  const onSignUpPress = async () => {
    if (!isLoaded) return;

    try {
      await signUp.create({
        emailAddress,
        password,
      });

      // Send verification email
      await signUp.prepareEmailAddressVerification({ strategy: 'email_code' });
      setPendingVerification(true);
    } catch (err: any) {
      Alert.alert('Error', err.errors[0].message);
    }
  };

  // Verify email with 6-digit code
  const onPressVerify = async () => {
    if (!isLoaded) return;

    try {
      const completeSignUp = await signUp.attemptEmailAddressVerification({
        code,
      });

      if (completeSignUp.status === 'complete') {
        await setActive({ session: completeSignUp.createdSessionId });
        router.replace('/onboarding');
      }
    } catch (err: any) {
      Alert.alert('Error', err.errors[0].message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View className="flex-1 justify-center px-6 bg-white">
      {!pendingVerification ? (
        <>

            onPress={onPressVerify}
          >
            <Text className="text-white text-center font-semibold">Verify Email</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}
```

#### **Sign In Screen (app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx)**
```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, Alert } from 'react-native';
import { useSignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import { router } from 'expo-router';

  const { signIn, setActive, isLoaded } = useSignIn();
  const [emailAddress, setEmailAddress] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const onSignInPress = async () => {
    if (!isLoaded) return;

    try {
      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({
        identifier: emailAddress,
        password,
      });

      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {
        await setActive({ session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId });
        router.replace('/dashboard');
      }
    } catch (err: any) {
      Alert.alert('Error', err.errors[0].message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View className="flex-1 justify-center px-6 bg-white">
      <Text className="text-2xl font-bold mb-8 text-center">Welcome Back</Text>
      
      <TextInput

```

### **3. Authentication Guard & Route Protection**

#### **Authentication Guard Component**
```tsx
// lib/auth/AuthenticationGuard.tsx
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import { useRouter, useSegments } from 'expo-router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export function AuthenticationGuard({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth();
  const segments = useSegments();
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isLoaded) return;

    const inAuthGroup = segments[0] === '(auth)';

    if (isSignedIn && inAuthGroup) {
      // Redirect authenticated users away from auth screens
      router.replace('/dashboard');
    } else if (!isSignedIn && !inAuthGroup) {
      // Redirect unauthenticated users to sign-in
      router.replace('/(auth)/sign-in');
    }
  }, [isSignedIn, segments, isLoaded]);

  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

### **4. Secure Token Management**

#### **Token Cache Implementation**
```tsx
// lib/auth/token-cache.ts
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

// Use secure storage for tokens
const createTokenCache = () => {
  return {
    async getToken(key: string) {
      try {
        if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
          return localStorage.getItem(key);
        }
        return SecureStore.getItemAsync(key);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error getting token:', err);
        return null;
      }
    },
    async saveToken(key: string, token: string) {
      try {
        if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
          localStorage.setItem(key, token);
        } else {
          await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, token);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error saving token:', err);
      }
    },
  };
};

export const tokenCache = createTokenCache();
```

  constructor() {
    this.encryptionKey = this.generateDeviceKey();
  }

  static getInstance(): LocalEncryption {
    if (!LocalEncryption.instance) {
      LocalEncryption.instance = new LocalEncryption();
    }
    return LocalEncryption.instance;
  }

  private async generateDeviceKey(): Promise<string> {
    const deviceId = await DeviceInfo.getUniqueId();
    const bundleId = DeviceInfo.getBundleId();
    return CryptoJS.SHA256(`${deviceId}-${bundleId}-assistantpro`).toString();
  }

  encryptData(data: any): string {
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(data);
    return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(jsonString, this.encryptionKey).toString();
  }

  decryptData<T>(encryptedData: string): T | null {
    try {
      const bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, this.encryptionKey);
      const decryptedString = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
      return JSON.parse(decryptedString);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Decryption failed:', error);
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

### **2. Session Management**
```tsx
// lib/auth/session-manager.ts
import { useAuth, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
import { LocalEncryption } from '@/lib/security/encryption';

export const useSessionManager = () => {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth();
  const { user } = useUser();
  const encryption = LocalEncryption.getInstance();

  const getSecureToken = async (): Promise<string | null> => {
    try {
      return await getToken();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Token retrieval failed:', error);
      return null;
    }
  };

  const getUserMetadata = () => {
    if (!user) return null;

    return {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress,
      phone: user.primaryPhoneNumber?.phoneNumber,
      createdAt: user.createdAt,
      lastSignInAt: user.lastSignInAt,
    };
  };

  const encryptAndStoreUserData = async (data: any, key: string) => {
    const encryptedData = encryption.encryptData(data);
    // Store in secure storage using your preferred method
  };

  return {
    isLoaded,
    isSignedIn,

import { tokenCache } from '@/lib/auth/token-cache';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
const publishableKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!;

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider 
      publishableKey={publishableKey} 
      tokenCache={tokenCache}
    >
      <ClerkLoaded>
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <LanguageProvider>
            <ThemeProvider>
              <PaperProvider>
                <AuthenticationGuard>
                  <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
                    <Stack.Screen name="(auth)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
                    <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />

## 🇮🇳 **India-Specific Optimizations**

### **1. Language Support & Localization**

#### **Language Provider (providers/LanguageProvider.tsx)**
```tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

interface LanguageContextType {
  language: 'hi' | 'en';
  setLanguage: (lang: 'hi' | 'en') => void;
  t: (key: string) => string;
}

const LanguageContext = createContext<LanguageContextType | undefined>(undefined);

const translations = {
  en: {
    welcome: 'Welcome to AssistantPro',
    dashboard: 'Dashboard',
    mudra: 'Mudra Finance',
    sikshak: 'Sikshak Education',
    settings: 'Settings',
    // Add more translations
  },
  hi: {
    welcome: 'असिस्टेंट प्रो में आपका स्वागत है',

      {children}
    </LanguageContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useLanguage = () => {
  const context = useContext(LanguageContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useLanguage must be used within a LanguageProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

### **2. Cultural Theme & Design System**

#### **Theme Provider (providers/ThemeProvider.tsx)**
```tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';

const IndianColors = {
  light: {
    primary: '#ea580c',        // Saffron
    secondary: '#059669',      // Green
    accent: '#3b82f6',         // Blue
    background: '#ffffff',

  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

### **3. Performance Optimization for Entry-Level Devices**

#### **Performance Monitor Hook (hooks/usePerformance.ts)**
```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    screenSize: 'medium',
    memoryOptimized: false,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
    const screenSize = width < 360 ? 'small' : width > 400 ? 'large' : 'medium';
    
    // Detect low-end devices (common in Indian market)
    const isLowEndDevice = Platform.OS === 'android' && (
      width < 360 || // Small screen
      Platform.Version < 28 // Older Android versions
    );

    setDeviceInfo({
      isLowEndDevice,
      screenSize,
      memoryOptimized: isLowEndDevice,
    });
  }, []);

  return deviceInfo;
};
```

#### **Optimized Component Rendering**
```tsx
// components/ui/OptimizedFlatList.tsx
import React, { memo } from 'react';
import { FlatList, ListRenderItem } from 'react-native';
import { usePerformanceOptimization } from '@/hooks/usePerformance';

interface OptimizedFlatListProps<T> {
  data: T[];
  renderItem: ListRenderItem<T>;
  keyExtractor: (item: T, index: number) => string;
}

function OptimizedFlatListComponent<T>({ 
  data, 
  renderItem, 
  keyExtractor 
}: OptimizedFlatListProps<T>) {
  const { isLowEndDevice } = usePerformanceOptimization();

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data}
      renderItem={renderItem}
      keyExtractor={keyExtractor}
      // Optimize for low-end devices
      removeClippedSubviews={isLowEndDevice}
      maxToRenderPerBatch={isLowEndDevice ? 5 : 10}
      updateCellsBatchingPeriod={isLowEndDevice ? 100 : 50}
      initialNumToRender={isLowEndDevice ? 5 : 10}
      windowSize={isLowEndDevice ? 5 : 10}
      getItemLayout={undefined} // Let FlatList calculate dynamically
    />
  );
}

export const OptimizedFlatList = memo(OptimizedFlatListComponent) as typeof OptimizedFlatListComponent;

## 🇮🇳 **Cultural Design Foundation**

### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Cultural Resonance**: Visual elements that connect with Indian users across regions
2. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for diverse languages, age groups, and technical literacy
3. **Privacy Transparency**: Visual indicators of data security and local processing
4. **Regional Adaptation**: Flexible components that adapt to local contexts
5. **Hierarchical Respect**: Design patterns that reflect Indian social structures

### **Cultural Color Psychology**
```
Primary Colors (Indian National Inspiration):
- Saffron (#FF9933): Leadership, wisdom, spiritual guidance
- White (#FFFFFF): Peace, truth, purity
- Green (#138808): Prosperity, growth, harmony

Secondary Colors (Regional & Emotional):
- Deep Blue (#003366): Trust, stability, professionalism
- Warm Gold (#FFD700): Prosperity, celebration, auspiciousness
- Terracotta (#CC6600): Earthiness, tradition, craftmanship
- Peacock Blue (#005F73): Cultural richness, artistic heritage
```

## 📱 **Screen Layouts & Responsive Design**

### **Mobile-First Grid System**
```css
/* Cultural Grid Container */
.container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 1rem;
}

/* Responsive Grid */
.grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .grid-sm-2 { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
  .grid-sm-3 { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); }
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .grid-md-2 { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
  .grid-md-3 { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); }
  .grid-md-4 { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .grid-lg-3 { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); }
  .grid-lg-4 { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
  .grid-lg-6 { grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr); }
}

/* Cultural Layout Patterns */
.layout-cultural {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header"
    "main"
    "footer";
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.layout-cultural-header {
  grid-area: header;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-primary-saffron), var(--color-saffron-dark));
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.layout-cultural-main {
  grid-area: main;
  padding: 1rem;
  flex: 1;
}

.layout-cultural-footer {
  grid-area: footer;
  background: var(--color-primary-green);
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### **Component Spacing System**
```css
/* Cultural Spacing Scale */
:root {
  --space-xs: 0.25rem;    /* 4px */
  --space-sm: 0.5rem;     /* 8px */
  --space-md: 1rem;       /* 16px */
  --space-lg: 1.5rem;     /* 24px */
  --space-xl: 2rem;       /* 32px */
  --space-2xl: 3rem;      /* 48px */
  --space-3xl: 4rem;      /* 64px */
}

/* Semantic Spacing Classes */
.m-cultural { margin: var(--space-md); }
.p-cultural { padding: var(--space-md); }
.gap-cultural { gap: var(--space-md); }

/* Cultural Section Spacing */
.section-greeting { margin-bottom: var(--space-2xl); }
.section-content { margin-bottom: var(--space-xl); }
.section-footer { margin-top: var(--space-2xl); }
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Guidelines**

### **CSS Custom Properties Strategy**
```css
/* Dynamic Theme Switching */
:root {
  --theme-transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

* {
  transition: var(--theme-transition);
}

/* Cultural Theme Variants */
[data-cultural-theme="festival"] {
  --color-primary-saffron: #FFB300;
  --color-primary-green: #2E7D32;
  --color-background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFF3E0, #FFFFFF);
}

[data-cultural-theme="monsoon"] {
  --color-primary-saffron: #4FC3F7;
  --color-primary-green: #388E3C;
  --color-background: linear-gradient(135deg, #E1F5FE, #FFFFFF);
}

[data-cultural-theme="winter"] {
  --color-primary-saffron: #FF8F00;
  --color-primary-green: #1B5E20;
  --color-background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFF8E1, #FFFFFF);
}
```

### **Accessibility Implementation**
```css
/* High Contrast Support */
@media (prefers-contrast: high) {
  :root {
    --color-primary-saffron: #CC6600;
    --color-primary-green: #0D5F0D;
    --color-text: #000000;
    --color-background: #FFFFFF;
  }
}

/* Reduced Motion Support */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}

/* Focus Management */
.focus-ring {
  outline: 2px solid var(--color-primary-saffron);
  outline-offset: 2px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

button:focus-visible,
input:focus-visible,
[tabindex]:focus-visible {
  @extend .focus-ring;
}
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```css
/* Critical CSS Patterns */
.above-fold {
  /* Critical styles for initial render */
  font-display: swap;
  contain: layout style paint;
}

/* Lazy Loading Classes */
.lazy-load {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease;
}

.lazy-load.loaded {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

/* GPU Acceleration for Animations */
.gpu-accelerated {
  transform: translateZ(0);
  will-change: transform;
}
```

## 📱 **Responsive Breakpoints**

```css
/* Mobile First */
.container {
  padding: 16px;
  max-width: 100%;
}

/* Small phones */
@media (max-width: 360px) {
  .container { padding: 12px; }
  .text-body { font-size: 14px; }
  .grid-2 { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
}

/* Large phones */
@media (min-width: 414px) {
  .container { padding: 20px; }
  .grid-auto { grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr)); }
}

/* Tablets */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container { 
    padding: 24px; 
    max-width: 768px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  .grid-3 { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); }
  .sidebar { display: block; }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container { max-width: 1024px; }
  .grid-4 { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
}
```

## 🎯 **Performance Optimization**

### **Critical Rendering Path**
```css
/* Above-the-fold critical CSS */
.critical {
  font-display: swap;
  contain: layout style paint;
}

/* Lazy loading implementation */
.lazy-image {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.lazy-image.loaded {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* GPU acceleration for animations */
.gpu-accelerated {
  transform: translateZ(0);
  will-change: transform;
}

/* Efficient shadows */
.optimized-shadow {
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
  /* Avoid multiple shadow layers */
}
```

### **Memory Optimization**
```javascript
// Virtual scrolling for long lists
const VirtualizedList = {
  itemHeight: 64,
  bufferSize: 3,
  maxRenderedItems: 20
};

// Image optimization
const imageConfig = {
  formats: ['webp', 'jpg'],
  sizes: [320, 640, 1280],
  quality: 85,
  lazyLoading: true
};
```

Transliteration converts text from one script to another while preserving the original pronunciation. For example, ‘नमस्ते’ becomes ‘namaste’ in English, and ‘how are you’ can be written as ‘हाउ आर यू’ in Devanagari. This process ensures that the sound of the original text remains intact, even when written in a different script.

Transliteration is useful when you want to represent words phonetically across different writing systems, such as converting ‘मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ’ to ‘main office ja raha hun’ in English letters.

Translation, on the other hand, converts text from one language to another while preserving the meaning rather than pronunciation. For example, ‘मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ’ translates to ‘I am going to the office’ in English, changing both the script and the language while conveying the intended message.

Examples of Transliteration:
‘Good morning’ becomes ‘गुड मॉर्निंग’ in Hindi, where the pronunciation is preserved but the meaning is not translated.
‘सुप्रभात’ becomes ‘suprabhat’ in English.

2. **Generate API Key**
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Create new key for AssistantPro
   - Copy and securely store the key

### Authentication Headers

All API requests require the following header:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
API-Subscription-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Python Implementation

```python
import os
import requests
from typing import Optional

class SarvamAuthenticator:
    def __init__(self, api_key: Optional[str] = None):
        self.api_key = api_key or os.getenv('SARVAM_API_KEY')
        if not self.api_key:
            raise ValueError("API key is required")
    
    def get_headers(self) -> dict:
        """Get authentication headers for API requests"""
        return {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'API-Subscription-Key': self.api_key
        }
    
    def make_authenticated_request(self, url: str, data: dict) -> requests.Response:
        """Make authenticated request to Sarvam AI API"""
        headers = self.get_headers()
        
        try:
            response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            raise SarvamAPIError(f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

# Usage
auth = SarvamAuthenticator()
headers = auth.get_headers()
```

#### JavaScript/Node.js Implementation

```javascript
class SarvamAuth {
    constructor(apiKey = null) {
        this.apiKey = apiKey || process.env.SARVAM_API_KEY;
        if (!this.apiKey) {
            throw new Error('API key is required');
        }
    }
    
    getHeaders() {
        return {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'API-Subscription-Key': this.apiKey
        };
    }
    
    async makeAuthenticatedRequest(url, data) {
        const headers = this.getHeaders();
        
        try {
            const response = await fetch(url, {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: headers,
                body: JSON.stringify(data)
            });
            
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
            }
            
            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            throw new Error(`Request failed: ${error.message}`);
        }
    }
}

// Usage
const auth = new SarvamAuth();
const headers = auth.getHeaders();
```

#### React/Frontend Implementation

```javascript
// utils/sarvamAuth.js
export class SarvamAuthClient {
    constructor(apiKey) {
        this.apiKey = apiKey;
        this.baseURL = 'https://api.sarvam.ai';
    }
    
    getHeaders() {
        return {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'API-Subscription-Key': this.apiKey
        };
    }
    
    async authenticatedFetch(endpoint, data) {
        const url = `${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`;
        const headers = this.getHeaders();
        
        const response = await fetch(url, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers,
            body: JSON.stringify(data)
        });
        
        if (!response.ok) {
            const error = await response.json();
            throw new Error(error.message || 'Request failed');
        }
        
        return response.json();
    }
}
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

```bash
# .env.local
SARVAM_API_KEY=your_development_api_key_here
SARVAM_BASE_URL=https://api.sarvam.ai
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# .env.production
SARVAM_API_KEY=your_production_api_key_here
SARVAM_BASE_URL=https://api.sarvam.ai
```

### Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
ENV SARVAM_API_KEY=""
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  assistantpro:
    environment:
      - SARVAM_API_KEY=${SARVAM_API_KEY}
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Protection

```python
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
import os
api_key = os.getenv('SARVAM_API_KEY')

# ❌ Bad: Hardcode in source code
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Never do this
```

### 2. Key Rotation Strategy

```python
class APIKeyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary_key = os.getenv('SARVAM_API_KEY_PRIMARY')
        self.backup_key = os.getenv('SARVAM_API_KEY_BACKUP')
    
    def get_active_key(self):
        """Get currently active API key with fallback"""
        return self.primary_key or self.backup_key
    
    def rotate_keys(self):
        """Implement key rotation logic"""
        # Switch primary and backup keys
        self.primary_key, self.backup_key = self.backup_key, self.primary_key
```

### 3. Request Validation

```python
def validate_api_key(api_key: str) -> bool:
    """Validate API key format"""
    if not api_key:
        return False
    
    # Check basic format (adjust based on Sarvam AI key format)
    if len(api_key) < 20:
        return False
        
    # Add more validation as needed
    return True
```

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors

```python
class AuthenticationError(Exception):
    """Raised when authentication fails"""
    pass

def handle_auth_error(response):
    """Handle authentication-related errors"""
    if response.status_code == 401:
        raise AuthenticationError("Invalid API key")
    elif response.status_code == 403:
        raise AuthenticationError("API key lacks required permissions")
    elif response.status_code == 429:
        raise AuthenticationError("Rate limit exceeded")
```

### Retry Logic with Authentication

```python
import time
from typing import Callable

def with_auth_retry(func: Callable, max_retries: int = 3):
    """Retry function with authentication error handling"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except AuthenticationError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

## Testing Authentication

### Unit Tests

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, Mock

def test_authentication_headers():
    """Test authentication header generation"""
    auth = SarvamAuthenticator("test-key")
    headers = auth.get_headers()
    
    assert headers['Content-Type'] == 'application/json'
    assert headers['API-Subscription-Key'] == 'test-key'

def test_missing_api_key():
    """Test error handling for missing API key"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        SarvamAuthenticator(None)

@patch('requests.post')
def test_authenticated_request(mock_post):
    """Test authenticated API request"""
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.status_code = 200
    mock_response.json.return_value = {'success': True}
    mock_post.return_value = mock_response
    
    auth = SarvamAuthenticator("test-key")
    response = auth.make_authenticated_request(
        "https://api.sarvam.ai/test", 
        {"test": "data"}
    )
    
    assert response.json()['success'] is True
    mock_post.assert_called_once()
```

## Integration with AssistantPro

### Service Layer Integration

```python
# services/sarvam_service.py
from .authentication import SarvamAuthenticator

class SarvamService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.auth = SarvamAuthenticator()
        self.base_url = "https://api.sarvam.ai"
    
    async def chat_completion(self, messages: list):
        """Chat completion with authentication"""
        url = f"{self.base_url}/chat/completions"
        data = {
            "model": "sarvamai/sarvam-2b-v0.5",
            "messages": messages
        }
        
        response = self.auth.make_authenticated_request(url, data)
        return response.json()
```

### Privacy-First Implementation

```python
class PrivacyAwareSarvamAuth:
    """Authentication with privacy safeguards"""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = self._sanitize_key(api_key)
        self.request_log = []  # Local logging only
    
    def _sanitize_key(self, key: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize API key for logging"""
        if len(key) > 8:
            return f"{key[:4]}{'*' * (len(key) - 8)}{key[-4:]}"
        return "*" * len(key)
    
    def log_request(self, endpoint: str, status: int):
        """Log request without sensitive data"""
        self.request_log.append({
            'endpoint': endpoint,
            'status': status,
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'api_key_hint': self._sanitize_key(self.api_key)
        })
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Authentication Metrics

```python
import logging

class AuthMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger('sarvam_auth')
        self.success_count = 0
        self.failure_count = 0
    
    def log_success(self):
        """Log successful authentication"""
        self.success_count += 1
        self.logger.info("Authentication successful")
    
    def log_failure(self, error: str):
        """Log authentication failure"""
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.logger.warning(f"Authentication failed: {error}")
    
    def get_metrics(self):
        """Get authentication metrics"""
        return {
            'success_rate': self.success_count / (self.success_count + self.failure_count),
            'total_requests': self.success_count + self.failure_count
        }
```

## Compliance and Privacy

### GDPR Compliance

- API keys are stored securely and not logged in plain text
- User data is not transmitted with authentication requests
- Key rotation capabilities for enhanced security

### Indian Data Protection

- Authentication tokens remain within Indian data centers when possible
- No third-party authentication providers used
- Direct API key management for maximum control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid API Key Error**
   ```
   Status: 401 Unauthorized
   Solution: Verify API key is correct and active
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   ```
   Status: 429 Too Many Requests
   Solution: Implement exponential backoff
   ```

3. **Permissions Error**
   ```
   Status: 403 Forbidden
   Solution: Check API key has required permissions
   ```

### Debug Mode

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Test authentication
auth = SarvamAuthenticator()
auth.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Next Steps

- Review [Rate Limits](./rate-limits.md) for usage optimization
- Check [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) for comprehensive error management
- See [Sarvam AI API](./sarvam-ai-api.md) for complete API documentation

# Error Handling and Recovery Guide

> Comprehensive error handling strategies for AssistantPro's robust and reliable AI platform

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive error handling strategies for AssistantPro's integration with Sarvam AI services, focusing on resilience, user experience, and graceful degradation for India's diverse connectivity conditions.

## Error Classification

### 1. HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Error Type | Description | Recovery Strategy |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters | Validate and retry with corrected data |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key | Check authentication, refresh key |
| 403 | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions | Verify API key permissions |
| 404 | Not Found | Endpoint or resource not found | Check API endpoint URLs |
| 429 | Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement exponential backoff |
| 500 | Server Error | Internal server error | Retry with exponential backoff |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Gateway timeout | Retry with longer timeout |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Service temporarily unavailable | Implement circuit breaker |

### 2. Service-Specific Errors

#### Chat Completion Errors
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "model_not_found",
    "message": "The specified model does not exist",
    "param": "model"
  }
}
```

#### Text-to-Speech Errors
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "validation_error",
    "code": "unsupported_language",
    "message": "Language 'xyz' is not supported",
    "param": "language_code"
  }
}
```

#### Speech-to-Text Errors
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "processing_error",
    "code": "audio_format_unsupported",
    "message": "Audio format not supported",
    "param": "audio_file"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling Implementation

### 1. Base Error Classes

```python
class SarvamAPIError(Exception):
    """Base exception for Sarvam AI API errors"""
    
    def __init__(self, message: str, error_code: str = None, 
                 status_code: int = None, response_data: dict = None):
        self.message = message
        self.error_code = error_code
        self.status_code = status_code
        self.response_data = response_data or {}
        super().__init__(self.message)

class AuthenticationError(SarvamAPIError):
    """Authentication-related errors"""
    pass

class RateLimitError(SarvamAPIError):
    """Rate limiting errors"""
    def __init__(self, message: str, retry_after: int = None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(message, **kwargs)
        self.retry_after = retry_after

class ValidationError(SarvamAPIError):
    """Request validation errors"""
    def __init__(self, message: str, field: str = None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(message, **kwargs)
        self.field = field

class ServiceUnavailableError(SarvamAPIError):
    """Service availability errors"""
    pass

class NetworkError(SarvamAPIError):
    """Network connectivity errors"""
    pass
```

### 2. Error Parser

```python
import json
from typing import Dict, Any

class ErrorParser:
    """Parse and classify API errors"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def parse_response_error(response) -> SarvamAPIError:
        """Parse error from HTTP response"""
        status_code = response.status_code
        
        try:
            error_data = response.json()
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            error_data = {"message": response.text or "Unknown error"}
        
        error_info = error_data.get("error", {})
        message = error_info.get("message", "API request failed")
        error_code = error_info.get("code")
        error_type = error_info.get("type")
        
        # Classify error based on status code and type
        if status_code == 401:
            return AuthenticationError(
                message, error_code, status_code, error_data
            )
        elif status_code == 429:
            retry_after = response.headers.get("Retry-After")
            retry_after = int(retry_after) if retry_after else None
            return RateLimitError(
                message, retry_after, error_code, status_code, error_data
            )
        elif status_code == 400 and error_type == "validation_error":
            field = error_info.get("param")
            return ValidationError(
                message, field, error_code, status_code, error_data
            )
        elif status_code in [502, 503, 504]:
            return ServiceUnavailableError(
                message, error_code, status_code, error_data
            )
        else:
            return SarvamAPIError(
                message, error_code, status_code, error_data
            )
    
    @staticmethod
    def parse_network_error(exception: Exception) -> NetworkError:
        """Parse network-related errors"""
        return NetworkError(
            f"Network error: {str(exception)}",
            error_code="network_error"
        )
```

### 3. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

```python
import asyncio
import random
import time
from typing import Callable, Any, Optional

class RetryHandler:
    def __init__(self, max_retries: int = 3, base_delay: float = 1.0, 
                 max_delay: float = 60.0, exponential_base: float = 2.0):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.base_delay = base_delay
        self.max_delay = max_delay
        self.exponential_base = exponential_base
    
    async def retry_with_backoff(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Execute function with exponential backoff retry"""
        last_exception = None
        
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries + 1):
            try:
                return await func(*args, **kwargs)
            
            except RateLimitError as e:
                if attempt == self.max_retries:
                    raise e
                
                # Use server-provided retry-after if available
                delay = e.retry_after or self._calculate_delay(attempt)
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                last_exception = e
            
            except (ServiceUnavailableError, NetworkError) as e:
                if attempt == self.max_retries:
                    raise e
                
                delay = self._calculate_delay(attempt)
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                last_exception = e
            
            except (AuthenticationError, ValidationError) as e:
                # Don't retry authentication or validation errors
                raise e
            
            except SarvamAPIError as e:
                if attempt == self.max_retries:
                    raise e
                
                # Retry other API errors with backoff
                delay = self._calculate_delay(attempt)
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                last_exception = e
        
        # Should not reach here, but raise last exception if it does
        raise last_exception
    
    def _calculate_delay(self, attempt: int) -> float:
        """Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter"""
        delay = min(
            self.base_delay * (self.exponential_base ** attempt),
            self.max_delay
        )
        
        # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
        jitter = random.uniform(0.1, 0.9)
        return delay * jitter
```

### 4. Circuit Breaker Implementation

```python
import time
from enum import Enum
from typing import Callable, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation
    OPEN = "open"          # Failing, reject requests
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"  # Testing if service recovered

@dataclass
class CircuitBreakerConfig:
    failure_threshold: int = 5
    recovery_timeout: int = 60
    success_threshold: int = 2  # For half-open state

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, service_name: str, config: CircuitBreakerConfig = None):
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.config = config or CircuitBreakerConfig()
        
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.success_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.last_request_time = None
    
    async def call(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Execute function with circuit breaker protection"""
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if self._should_attempt_reset():
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
                self.success_count = 0
            else:
                raise ServiceUnavailableError(
                    f"Circuit breaker is open for {self.service_name}",
                    error_code="circuit_breaker_open"
                )
        
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()

## Integration Examples

### 1. React Error Boundary

```javascript
// components/ErrorBoundary.jsx
import React from 'react';

class SarvamErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { 
            hasError: false, 
            error: null,
            errorInfo: null,
            userMessage: null
        };
    }

    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        return { hasError: true };
    }

    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
        this.setState({
            error: error,
            errorInfo: errorInfo,
            userMessage: this.formatErrorMessage(error)
        });
        
        // Log error to monitoring service
        this.logError(error, errorInfo);
    }

            return (
                <div className="error-container">
                    <h3>Something went wrong</h3>

            );
        }

        return this.props.children;
    }
}

export default SarvamErrorBoundary;
```

### 2. Service Layer Integration

```python
# services/chat_service.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from .error_handling import SarvamErrorHandler

class ChatService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.error_handler = SarvamErrorHandler()
        self.base_url = "https://api.sarvam.ai"
    
    async def generate_response(self, messages: List[Dict[str, str]], 
                              user_language: str = 'en') -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate chat response with comprehensive error handling"""
        
        async def api_call():
            # Actual API call implementation
            return await self._make_chat_request(messages)
        
        try:
            result = await self.error_handler.handle_request(
                "chat_completions", api_call
            )
            return result
        
        except Exception as e:
            # Format error for user
            formatted_error = self.error_handler.user_error_formatter.format_error_for_user(
                e, user_language
            )
            
            return {
                "error": True,
                "message": formatted_error['user_message'],
                "can_retry": formatted_error['retry_suggested'],
                "retry_after": formatted_error.get('retry_after')
            }
    
    async def _make_chat_request(self, messages: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Make actual chat API request"""
        # Implementation details...
        pass
```

## Best Practices Summary

### 1. Error Handling Principles

- **Fail Fast**: Don't hide errors, handle them appropriately
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallback functionality when possible
- **User-Centric**: Show user-friendly messages in local languages
- **Observability**: Log errors for monitoring and debugging
- **Recovery**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### 2. India-Specific Considerations

- **Network Variability**: Handle poor connectivity gracefully
- **Regional Endpoints**: Use regional fallbacks for better performance
- **Language Support**: Provide error messages in local languages
- **Device Constraints**: Optimize for low-end devices with limited resources

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

- **Error Rates**: Monitor error rates by service and region
- **Performance Impact**: Track how errors affect user experience
- **Recovery Times**: Measure how quickly services recover
- **User Impact**: Understand which errors affect users most

## Next Steps

- Review [Authentication Guide](./authentication.md) for secure error handling
- Check [Rate Limits](./rate-limits.md) for rate limit error prevention
- See [Sarvam AI API](./sarvam-ai-api.md) for service-specific error codes

Headers
Authorization
string
Required
Bearer token for authentication. Format: “Bearer <token>”

Request
This endpoint expects an object.
messages
list of objects
Required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.


Show 3 variants
model
"sarvam-m"
Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like sarvam-m.

temperature
double
Optional
>=0
<=2
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

top_p
double
Optional
>=0
<=1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

reasoning_effort
enum
Optional
Allowed values:
low
medium
high
max_tokens
integer
Optional
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.

stream
boolean
Optional
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events.

stop
string or list of strings
Optional
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.


Show 2 variants
n
integer
Optional
>=1
<=128
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

seed
integer
Optional
This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

frequency_penalty
double
Optional
>=-2
<=2
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model’s likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

presence_penalty
double
Optional
>=-2
<=2
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model’s likelihood to talk about new topics.

wiki_grounding
boolean
Optional
If set to true, the model response will be wiki grounded.

Response
Successful Response

id
string
A unique identifier for the chat completion.

choices
list of objects
A list of chat completion choices. Can be more than one if n is greater than 1.


Show 3 properties

            return limit_info.remaining > 0
    
    def get_wait_time(self, service: str) -> Optional[int]:
        """Get seconds to wait before next request"""

            limit_info = self.limits[service]
            
            if limit_info.remaining > 0:
                return None
            
            return max(0, limit_info.reset_time - int(time.time()))
```

### 2. Request Queue Management

```python
import asyncio
from collections import deque
from typing import Callable, Any

class RequestQueue:
    def __init__(self, max_concurrent: int = 5):
        self.queue = deque()
        self.max_concurrent = max_concurrent

            'kwargs': kwargs,
            'future': asyncio.Future()
        }
        
        self.queue.append(request_item)
        await self._process_queue()

            # Check rate limits
            if not self.rate_tracker.can_make_request(service):
                wait_time = self.rate_tracker.get_wait_time(service)
                if wait_time:
                    await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
                    continue
            
            # Execute request
            request = self.queue.popleft()
            self.active_requests += 1

        finally:
            self.active_requests -= 1
            await self._process_queue()
```

### 3. Intelligent Batching

```python
class BatchProcessor:
    def __init__(self, batch_size: int = 10, batch_timeout: float = 2.0):
        self.batch_size = batch_size

            )
        
        # Process immediately if batch is full
        if len(self.pending_requests) >= self.batch_size:
            await self._process_batch()
    
    async def _batch_timeout_handler(self):
        """Handle batch timeout"""
        await asyncio.sleep(self.batch_timeout)

    async def _process_batch(self):
        """Process accumulated batch"""
        if not self.pending_requests:
            return
        
        batch = self.pending_requests.copy()
        self.pending_requests.clear()
        
        if self.batch_timer:
            self.batch_timer.cancel()
            self.batch_timer = None

            tasks.append(task)
        
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Caching Strategy

```python
import hashlib
import json
from typing import Optional, Any
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ResponseCache:
    def __init__(self, ttl_minutes: int = 60):
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = timedelta(minutes=ttl_minutes)
    
    def _generate_key(self, service: str, params: dict) -> str:
        """Generate cache key from service and parameters"""
        cache_data = {
            'service': service,
            'params': sorted(params.items())
        }
        cache_string = json.dumps(cache_data, sort_keys=True)
        return hashlib.md5(cache_string.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    def get(self, service: str, params: dict) -> Optional[Any]:
        """Get cached response"""
        key = self._generate_key(service, params)
        
        if key in self.cache:
            cached_item = self.cache[key]
            if datetime.now() - cached_item['timestamp'] < self.ttl:
                return cached_item['data']
            else:
                del self.cache[key]
        
        return None
    
    def set(self, service: str, params: dict, data: Any):
        """Cache response"""
        key = self._generate_key(service, params)
        self.cache[key] = {
            'data': data,

        }
    
    def clear_expired(self):
        """Clear expired cache entries"""
        current_time = datetime.now()
        expired_keys = [
            key for key, value in self.cache.items()
            if current_time - value['timestamp'] >= self.ttl
        ]
        
        for key in expired_keys:
            del self.cache[key]
```

### 2. Adaptive Rate Management

```python
class AdaptiveRateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.success_rates = {}
        self.adaptive_delays = {}
        self.min_delay = 0.1
        self.max_delay = 5.0
    
    def record_request(self, service: str, success: bool, response_time: float):
        """Record request outcome for adaptive management"""
        if service not in self.success_rates:
            self.success_rates[service] = []
            self.adaptive_delays[service] = self.min_delay
        
        self.success_rates[service].append({
            'success': success,
            'response_time': response_time,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
        
        # Keep only recent data (last 100 requests)
        if len(self.success_rates[service]) > 100:
            self.success_rates[service] = self.success_rates[service][-100:]
        
        self._adjust_delay(service)
    
    def _adjust_delay(self, service: str):
        """Adjust delay based on success rate and response times"""
        recent_requests = self.success_rates[service][-20:]  # Last 20 requests
        
        if not recent_requests:
            return
        
        success_rate = sum(1 for r in recent_requests if r['success']) / len(recent_requests)
        avg_response_time = sum(r['response_time'] for r in recent_requests) / len(recent_requests)
        
        current_delay = self.adaptive_delays[service]
        
        # Increase delay if success rate is low or response time is high
        if success_rate < 0.8 or avg_response_time > 2.0:
            new_delay = min(current_delay * 1.5, self.max_delay)
        else:

    def get_delay(self, service: str) -> float:
        """Get adaptive delay for service"""
        return self.adaptive_delays.get(service, self.min_delay)
```

### 3. Priority Queue Implementation

```python

        except Exception as e:
            request.future.set_exception(e)
```

## India-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Network Condition Adaptation

```python
class NetworkAwareRateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_quality = "good"  # good, fair, poor
        self.regional_delays = {

### 2. Device-Aware Optimization

```python

## Best Practices

### 1. Graceful Degradation

```python

        service_config = self.config.get(service, {})
        return service_config.get(period, 60)
```

## Error Recovery

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

```python
import time
from enum import Enum

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"
    OPEN = "open"
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute function with circuit breaker protection"""
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker is open")
        
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise e
    
    def _on_success(self):
        """Handle successful request"""
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    def _on_failure(self):
        """Handle failed request"""
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
```

## Testing Rate Limits

### 1. Load Testing

```python
import asyncio
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def rate_limit_load_test():
    """Test rate limiting under load"""
    start_time = time.time()
    tasks = []
    
    # Create 100 concurrent requests
    for i in range(100):
        task = asyncio.create_task(make_test_request(f"request_{i}"))
        tasks.append(task)
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    end_time = time.time()
    duration = end_time - start_time
    
    # Analyze results
    successful = sum(1 for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception))
    rate_limited = sum(1 for r in results if isinstance(r, RateLimitError))
    
    print(f"Duration: {duration:.2f}s")
    print(f"Successful: {successful}")
    print(f"Rate Limited: {rate_limited}")
    print(f"Requests/second: {len(tasks)/duration:.2f}")

async def make_test_request(request_id: str):
    """Make a test request"""
    # Simulate API request
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return f"Response for {request_id}"
```

# Sarvam AI API Reference - AssistantPro Integration

## Overview
Complete API reference for integrating Sarvam AI's Indian language AI platform with AssistantPro. This guide covers all endpoints, authentication, error handling, and best practices for building India's privacy-first AI assistant.

## Authentication

### API Subscription Key
All Sarvam AI endpoints require authentication using an API subscription key obtained from the [Sarvam Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai).

```bash
# Header format for all requests
api-subscription-key: YOUR_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY
```

### Best Practices
- **Store securely**: Use environment variables, never hardcode in client-side code
- **Monitor usage**: Check credit utilization in dashboard regularly
- **Environment separation**: Use different keys for development/production

</details>

## Rate Limits & Optimization

### Current Limits
- **Requests per minute**: 60 (Free tier)
- **Requests per day**: 1000 (Free tier)
- **File size limit**: 30MB for audio files
- **Text length limit**: 10,000 characters per request

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Request Batching
```python
def batch_translations(texts: list, target_language: str, batch_size: int = 10):
    """Batch multiple translations to optimize API usage"""
    results = []
    for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size):
        batch = texts[i:i + batch_size]
        # Combine texts with separator
        combined_text = " [SEP] ".join(batch)
        
        translated = translate_text(combined_text, target_language)
        batch_results = translated["translated_text"].split(" [SEP] ")
        results.extend(batch_results)
    
    return results
```

#### 2. Caching
```python
import hashlib
import json
from functools import lru_cache

class CachedSarvamClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = SarvamAIClient(api_key)
        self.cache = {}

    def _get_cache_key(self, endpoint: str, params: dict) -> str:
        """Generate cache key for request"""
        cache_data = f"{endpoint}:{json.dumps(params, sort_keys=True)}"
        return hashlib.md5(cache_data.encode()).hexdigest()

    def cached_translate(self, text: str, target_language: str, ttl: int = 3600):
        """Cached translation to reduce API calls"""
        cache_key = self._get_cache_key("translate", {
            "text": text, 
            "target": target_language
        })
        
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            cached_result, timestamp = self.cache[cache_key]
            if time.time() - timestamp < ttl:
                return cached_result
        
        # Make API call if not cached or expired
        result = self.client.translate_text(text, target_language)
        self.cache[cache_key] = (result, time.time())
        return result
```

#### 3. Asynchronous Processing
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

class AsyncSarvamClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.sarvam.ai"

    async def async_translate(self, session: aiohttp.ClientSession, text: str, target_language: str):
        """Async translation for concurrent requests"""
        headers = {
            "api-subscription-key": self.api_key,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        
        payload = {
            "input": text,
            "source_language_code": "auto",
            "target_language_code": target_language
        }
        
        async with session.post(f"{self.base_url}/translate", headers=headers, json=payload) as response:
            return await response.json()

    async def batch_translate_async(self, texts: list, target_language: str):
        """Process multiple translations concurrently"""
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            tasks = [self.async_translate(session, text, target_language) for text in texts]
            results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
            return results
```

## Best Practices for AssistantPro Integration

### 1. Privacy-First Implementation
```python
import hashlib
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class PrivacySarvamClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, encryption_key: bytes):
        self.client = SarvamAIClient(api_key)
        self.cipher = Fernet(encryption_key)

    def hash_user_input(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Hash user input before logging for privacy"""
        return hashlib.sha256(user_input.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]

    def secure_chat(self, user_message: str, user_id: str) -> str:
        """Privacy-aware chat completion"""
        # Log only hashed version for debugging
        message_hash = self.hash_user_input(user_message)
        print(f"Processing message {message_hash} for user {user_id}")
        
        # Process with Sarvam AI
        response = self.client.chat_completion([
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        ])
        
        # Don't log the actual response content
        print(f"Response generated for message {message_hash}")
        return response
```

### 2. Cultural Context Integration
```python
class CulturalSarvamClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = SarvamAIClient(api_key)
        self.cultural_prompts = {
            "financial": """You are a financial advisor familiar with Indian banking, 
                          UPI payments, and investment options like PPF, ELSS, and FDs.""",
            "educational": """You understand the Indian education system, 
                            including CBSE, ICSE, and state boards.""",
            "general": """You are culturally aware of Indian traditions, festivals, 
                        and social contexts."""
        }

    def get_cultural_response(self, user_message: str, context: str = "general") -> str:
        """Get culturally appropriate response"""
        system_prompt = self.cultural_prompts.get(context, self.cultural_prompts["general"])
        
        return self.client.chat_completion([
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        ])
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```python
import time
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, List

@dataclass
class APIMetrics:
    endpoint: str
    response_time: float
    status_code: int
    tokens_used: int
    timestamp: float

class MonitoredSarvamClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = SarvamAIClient(api_key)
        self.metrics: List[APIMetrics] = []

    def timed_request(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Monitor API request performance"""
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            response_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            # Log metrics
            metric = APIMetrics(
                endpoint=func.__name__,
                response_time=response_time,
                status_code=200,
                tokens_used=len(str(result)) // 4,  # Rough estimate
                timestamp=time.time()
            )
            self.metrics.append(metric)
            
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            response_time = time.time() - start_time
            metric = APIMetrics(
                endpoint=func.__name__,
                response_time=response_time,
                status_code=500,
                tokens_used=0,
                timestamp=time.time()
            )
            self.metrics.append(metric)
            raise e

    def get_performance_stats(self) -> Dict:
        """Get performance statistics"""
        if not self.metrics:
            return {}
        
        response_times = [m.response_time for m in self.metrics]
        return {
            "total_requests": len(self.metrics),
            "avg_response_time": sum(response_times) / len(response_times),
            "max_response_time": max(response_times),
            "success_rate": len([m for m in self.metrics if m.status_code == 200]) / len(self.metrics)
        }
```

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Test Examples
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

class TestSarvamIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = SarvamAIClient("test-api-key")

    @patch('requests.post')
    def test_chat_completion_success(self, mock_post):
        # Mock successful response
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.status_code = 200
        mock_response.json.return_value = {
            "choices": [{"message": {"content": "Hello from Sarvam!"}}]
        }
        mock_post.return_value = mock_response

        result = self.client.chat_completion([
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
        ])

        self.assertEqual(result, "Hello from Sarvam!")

    @patch('requests.post')
    def test_rate_limiting_retry(self, mock_post):
        # Mock rate limiting then success
        mock_response_429 = MagicMock()
        mock_response_429.status_code = 429
        
        mock_response_200 = MagicMock()
        mock_response_200.status_code = 200
        mock_response_200.json.return_value = {
            "choices": [{"message": {"content": "Success after retry"}}]
        }
        
        mock_post.side_effect = [mock_response_429, mock_response_200]

        result = self.client.chat_completion([
            {"role": "user", "content": "Test"}
        ])

        self.assertEqual(result, "Success after retry")
        self.assertEqual(mock_post.call_count, 2)

title: Authentication
slug: api-reference-docs/authentication
---

All API endpoints are authenticated using API Subscription Keys provided by Sarvam AI when you sign up. Include these keys in the header of each API request as follows:

```
api-subscription-key: <your-api-key>
```

### Obtaining Your API Subscription Key

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on the [Sarvam Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai)
2. **Generate Key**: When you sign up, an API key is generated for your account and shown in the dashboard.
3. **Organisation Key Management**: Create Organisational level keys is not currently supported and will be available soon.

#### Best Practices for API Key Management

1. **Keep Your Key Secret**: Never expose your API key in public repositories or client-side code.
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.
3. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your API usage on the Sarvam dashboard. You should be able to see the credits utilised & remaining

### Using the API Subscription Key

To authenticate your requests, include the `API-Subscription-Key` in the headers of your HTTP requests. Here's an example using SarvamAI SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock title="Python" active>

    ```python

    from sarvamai import SarvamAI

    client = SarvamAI(
        api_subscription_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    )

    response = client.text.translate(
        input="Hi, My Name is Vinayak.",
        source_language_code="auto",
        target_language_code="hi-IN",
        speaker_gender="Male"
    )

    print(response)
    ```

  </CodeBlock>

  <CodeBlock title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    import { SarvamAIClient } from "sarvamai";

const client = new SarvamAIClient({ apiSubscriptionKey: "YOUR_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY" });

await client.text.translate({
input: "input",
source_language_code: "auto",
target_language_code: "en-IN",

});

````
  </CodeBlock>

  <CodeBlock title="curl">
    ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.sarvam.ai/translate \

-H "api-subscription-key: <YOUR_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY>" \

## What is a Meta-Prompt?
A **meta-prompt** is a detailed instruction or template given to an AI, telling it how to think, act, or respond in specific scenarios. It sets the rules and context for the AI to follow consistently throughout the conversation.
## Why Use a Meta-Prompt?
1. **Consistency**  
Ensures the AI understands your goals and behaves in a reliable way.
2. **Clarity**  
Provides clear instructions, making the AI's responses more accurate and relevant.
3. **Efficiency**  
Saves time by reducing the need to explain the same context repeatedly.
4. **Customization**  
Adjusts the AI to fit specific tasks or workflows based on your needs.

---
Meta-prompts are especially helpful when working on complex tasks or integrating APIs, as they align the AI's responses with your requirements.
## **Meta-Prompt Usage Guide**

Follow these steps to effectively use the meta-prompt with your favorite AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar tools):  

#### **Step 1: Load the Meta-Prompt**  
Copy and paste the [meta-prompt](#meta-prompt) into the AI assistant’s input field. This will provide the AI with the necessary context to help you use Sarvam's APIs effectively.  

#### **Step 2: Provide Context for Your Use Case**  
In the next message, let the AI know that the meta-prompt should be taken as context for assisting you in building projects with Sarvam's APIs. You can use the following example:  
> "Hey, you have to take the above meta-prompt as your context and help me build things using Sarvam's API. I will provide the details in further prompts."

#### **Step 3: Share Your Specific Requirement**  
In subsequent messages, provide the specific details of the project or task you want to build. For example, if you want to create a translator app, you can say:  
> "I want to build a translator app that can translate English to Kannada. Please help me implement this using Sarvam's API."

---
With this implementation, you can input any English text, and the app will return the translated text in Kannada. Ensure you replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual Sarvam API subscription key.

By following this guide, you can seamlessly use the meta-prompt to leverage Sarvam's APIs for building various projects.

## Sarvam AI Meta Prompt 
**Note:-** This meta-prompt is designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini, not for human users. It provides context and instructions to guide the AI in assisting with tasks using Sarvam's API effectively.

```
You are an AI engineer designed to help users use Sarvam's APIs for their specific use case.

- Assume, the Bearer is stored in the environment variable named "SARVAM_API_KEY" and add the following comment to the implementation: "Get your Sarvam AI API subscription key here: https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/admin".
- Use the simplest solution possible (use single API's whenever possible, do not overcomplicate things).
- Answer "can't do" for tasks outside the scope of Sarvam AI.
- Choose built-in features over custom implementations whenever possible.
- You must use the Sarvam APIs for the implementation.
- Never decline an implementation because of its complexity.
- Generate production-ready code that follows exactly the requirements.
- Never use placeholder data.
- For every request to any of the Sarvam APIs, you must include the header -H "Accept: application/json" to specify that the response should be in JSON format.

### API Authentication Instructions

1. Add API Key to Headers:
    
    Include the header `api-subscription-key` with your API key in every request.
    
2. Request Structure:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    
    url = 'https://api.sarvam.ai/<api-endpoint>'
    headers = {'api-subscription-key': 'your-api-key'}
    payload = { 'key': 'value' }  # Replace with endpoint-specific data
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    
    
    
3. Replace Placeholders:
    - `<api-endpoint>`: Specific endpoint URL (e.g., `text-analytics`).
    - `'your-api-key'`: Your subscription key.
    - `'payload'`: Data required by the endpoint.
4. Send Request:
    
    Use the `requests.post` method to make authenticated calls.
    
5. Process Response:
    
    Parse the JSON response using `response.json()`.
    

For all APIs, ensure the payload matches the endpoint's requirements.

# Integration Guidelines

1. Ensure secure API communication using HTTPS to protect sensitive data.
2. Use API rate limiting to avoid overloading the server and ensure smooth performance.
3. Validate inputs and sanitize data before sending it to APIs to prevent injection attacks.
4. Always handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages for debugging.
5. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth or API keys to restrict access.
6. Log API requests and responses for tracking and troubleshooting issues.
7. Use versioning in API URLs to maintain backward compatibility with existing clients.
8. Follow consistent naming conventions for API endpoints and parameters to improve usability.
9. Optimize response times by caching frequently requested data where appropriate.
10. Regularly monitor and audit API usage to identify and mitigate any performance bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities.

# Tips for responding to user requests

1. Start by analyzing the task and identifying which API's should be used;
2. If multiple API's are required, outline the purpose of each API;
3. Write the code for calling each API as a separate function, and correctly handle any possible errors;
It is important to write reusable code, so that the user can reap the most benefits out of your response.

Note: Make sure to parse the response of each API correctly so that the data can be used effectively in your application. For example, if you're using the **Speech-to-Text API**, the transcript content should be extracted from the response like `transcript = response["data"]["transcript"]`. Similarly, if you are using the **Text-Analytics API**, you should extract the answers by accessing the response like `answers = response["data"]["answers"]`.

1. Write the complete code, including input loading, calling the API functions, and saving/printing results.
Ensure to use variables for required API keys. Be sure to properly set these variables before making any API requests.

# Overview

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the **Chat Completion API** for generating text completions using **Sarvam**. It includes instructions for installation, setting up the API key, and making API calls to generate completions.

## 0. Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```python
pip install requests
```

## 1. Import Required Libraries

This section imports the necessary Python libraries for making HTTP requests:

```python
import requests
```

- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the API.

## 2. Set Up the API Endpoint and Payload

To use the Sarvam API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Obtain your API key**: If you don't have an API key, sign up on the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/) to get one.
2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key.

```python
import os

# Replace with your actual API key
SARVAM_API_KEY = "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
SARVAM_API_URL = "https://api.sarvam.ai/v1/chat/completions"
```

### 2.1 Setting Up the API Headers and Payload

This section defines the headers and payload for the chat completion request:

```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

payload = {
    "model": "sarvam-m",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of India?"},
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 1.0,
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "n": 1,
}
```

## 3. Making the API Request

This section demonstrates how to make a request to the Chat Completion API and handle the response:

```python
def get_chat_completion(api_url, headers, payload):
    try:
        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            return result
        else:
            print("Request failed:", response.status_code, response.text)
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error making request: {e}")
        return None
```

### 3.1 Sending the Request and Processing the Response

## **1️⃣ Setup & Installation**

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```python
!pip install requests
```

```python
import requests
```

## **2️⃣ Authentication**

```

## **3️⃣ Basic Usage**

The API requires a single key parameter:

✔ **`input`** – The text for which the language code and script code need to be detected.

🚫 **Note:** If the API is unable to detect the language or script, it will return `null` for both fields.

### **Response Parameters**

- **`language_code`** (String) – The detected language in BCP-47 format. Supported values:

  - `"en-IN"` (English - India)
  - `"en-US"` (English - United States)
  - `"bn-IN"` (Bengali - India)
  - `"gu-IN"` (Gujarati - India)
  - `"hi-IN"` (Hindi - India)
  - `"kn-IN"` (Kannada - India)
  - `"ml-IN"` (Malayalam - India)
  - `"mr-IN"` (Marathi - India)
  - `"od-IN"` (Odia - India)
  - `"pa-IN"` (Punjabi - India)
  - `"ta-IN"` (Tamil - India)
  - `"te-IN"` (Telugu - India)
  - `"ur-IN"` (Urdu - India)

- **`script_code`** (String) – The detected writing script in ISO-15924 format. Supported values:
  - `"Latn"` → Latin (Roman script)
  - `"Beng"` → Bengali script
  - `"Gujr"` → Gujarati script
  - `"Deva"` → Devanagari script
  - `"Knda"` → Kannada script
  - `"Mlym"` → Malayalam script
  - `"Orya"` → Odia script
  - `"Guru"` → Gurmukhi (Punjabi) script
  - `"Taml"` → Tamil script
  - `"Telu"` → Telugu script
  - `"Arab"` → Arabic script

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/text-lid"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
example_text="hey, what is your name?"
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": example_text
}

# Send API request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Process response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    language_code = data.get("language_code", "Language not detected")
    script_code = data.get("script_code", "Script not detected")

    print("\n=== Detection Results ===")
    print(f"Detected Language Code: {language_code}")
    print(f"Detected Script Code: {script_code}\n")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

```python
example_text="A'in jun aatinob'aal li maare ink'a' neketaw ru."
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": example_text
}

# Send API request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Process response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    language_code = data.get("language_code", "Language not detected")
    script_code = data.get("script_code", "Script not detected")

    print("\n=== Detection Results ===")
    print(f"Detected Language Code: {language_code}")
    print(f"Detected Script Code: {script_code}\n")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## **4️⃣ Auto Detection**

To enable automatic language detection, pass `"auto"` as the `source_language_code`. The API will return the transliterated/translated text along with the detected source language code.

🚫 **Note:** In case of detection failure, manually specify the `source_language_code` with one of the supported language codes.

If the API is unable to detect the language, the response will include an error message:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Unable to detect the language of the input text. Please explicitly pass the `source_language_code` parameter with a supported language.",
    "code": "unprocessable_entity_error"
  }
}
```

### Auto Detection in Transliterate

```python
import requests

# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/transliterate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "auto",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    transliterated_text = response_data.get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    source_language_code = response_data.get("source_language_code")

    print(f"✅ Transliteration Successful!\n🔤 Transliterated Text: {transliterated_text}")
    print(f"🌍 Detected Source Language: {source_language_code}")

    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "classic-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है"
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    translated_text = response_data.get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    source_language_code = response_data.get("source_language_code", "Unknown")

    print(f"✅ Translation Successful!\n🌍 Detected Source Language: {source_language_code}")
    print(f"📝 Translated Text: {translated_text}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

## **5️⃣ Error Handling**

You may encounter these errors while using the API:

  A comprehensive guide to using the Sarvam Translate API to translate text
  between languages with advanced features like transliteration, output scripts,
  and gender options
---

# Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the **Sarvam Translate API** to translate texts/paragraphs from one language to another. The API supports additional features such as transliteration (a type of conversion of a text from one script to another that involves swapping letters), output_script and gender.

## 1. Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```python
pip install requests
```

```python
import requests
```

## 2. Authentication

To use the Sarvam API, you need an API subscription key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Obtain your API key**: If you don't have an API key, sign up on the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/) to get one.
2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

```python
SARVAM_API_KEY = "YOUR_SARVAM_API_KEY"
```

## 3. Basic Usage

### 3.1. Read the Document

We have two sample documents under the `data` folder:

- `sample1.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in English.
- `sample2.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in Hindi.

```python
def read_file(file_path, lang_name):
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            # Read the first 5 lines
            lines = [next(file) for _ in range(5)]
            print(f"=== {lang_name} Text (First Few Lines) ===")
            print("".join(lines))  # Print first few lines

            # Read the remaining content
            remaining_text = file.read()

            # Combine all text
            full_doc = "".join(lines) + remaining_text

            # Count total characters
            total_chars = len(full_doc)
            print(f"\nTotal number of characters in {lang_name} file:", total_chars)

            return full_doc
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while reading {file_path}: {e}")
        return None
```

```python
# Read English and Hindi documents
english_doc = read_file("data/sample1.txt", "English")
hindi_doc = read_file("data/sample2.txt", "Hindi")
```

### 3.2. Split the text into chunks

Since the API has a restriction of 1000 characters per request, we need to split the text accordingly.

```python
def chunk_text(text, max_length=1000):
    """Splits text into chunks of at most max_length characters while preserving word boundaries."""
    chunks = []

    while len(text) > max_length:
        split_index = text.rfind(" ", 0, max_length)  # Find the last space within limit
        if split_index == -1:
            split_index = max_length  # No space found, force split at max_length

        chunks.append(text[:split_index].strip())  # Trim spaces before adding
        text = text[split_index:].lstrip()  # Remove leading spaces for the next chunk

    if text:
        chunks.append(text.strip())  # Add the last chunk

    return chunks
```

```python
# Split the text
english_text_chunks = chunk_text(english_doc)

# Display chunk info
print(f"Total Chunks: {len(english_text_chunks)}")
for i, chunk in enumerate(english_text_chunks[:3], 1):  # Show only first 3 chunks for preview
    print(f"\n=== Chunk {i} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ===\n{chunk}")
```

### 3.3. Setting up the API Endpoint

There are three main types of translations supported:

1. **English to Indic** - Translating from English to Indian languages
2. **Indic to English** - Converting Indian languages to English
3. **Indic to Indic** - Translating between Indian languages

#### Indic to English Translation

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "target_language_code": "en-IN",
        "speaker_gender": "Male",
        "mode": "classic-colloquial",
        "model": "mayura:v1",
        "enable_preprocessing": False,
        "input": chunk
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

#### Indic to Indic Translation

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"

        "input": chunk
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

#### English to Indic Translation

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(english_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "source_language_code": "en-IN",
        "target_language_code": "pa-IN",
        "speaker_gender": "Male",
        "mode": "classic-colloquial",
        "model": "mayura:v1",
        "enable_preprocessing": False,

        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

## 4. Translation Modes

### Translation Modes & Differences

1. **Formal** – Highly professional, uses pure Hindi (e.g., "कुल राशि", "देय है"). Suitable for official documents, legal papers, and corporate communication.
2. **Classic-Colloquial** – Balanced mix of Hindi & English, slightly informal (e.g., "कुल जोड़", "देना होगा"). Ideal for business emails, customer support, and semi-formal communication.
3. **Modern-Colloquial** – Hinglish, casual, and direct (e.g., "Invoice total", "due है", "contact करो"). Best for chatbots, social media, and casual conversations.

**Rule of Thumb:**

- Use Formal for official content
- Use Classic-Colloquial for general communication
- Use Modern-Colloquial for everyday conversations

```python
# To highlight the difference between the models lets use the below example.
full_text = (
    "The invoice total is $3,450.75, due by 15th March 2025. Contact us at support@example.com for queries. "
    "Order #987654321 was placed on 02/29/2024. Your tracking ID is TRK12345678."
)
```

```python
# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/translate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### 4.1. Classic Colloquial

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "classic-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 4.2. Formal

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "formal",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 4.3. Modern Colloquial

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## 5. Advanced Features

### 5.1. Speaker Gender

The translation model supports **Male** and **Female** speaker options, which impact the tone and style of the output.

#### Female

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

#### Male

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Male",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "input": full_text
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.2. Numerals Format Feature

The `numerals_format` parameter controls how numbers appear in the translation. It has two options:

1. **International (Default)** - Uses standard 0-9 numerals.
   Example: "मेरा phone number है: 9840950950."
   Best for universally understood content, technical documents, and modern usage.

2. **Native** - Uses language-specific numerals.
   Example: "मेरा phone number है: ९८४०९५०९५०."
   Ideal for traditional texts, cultural adaptation, and regional content.

**When to Use What?**

- Use **International** for wider readability and digital content
- Use **Native** for localized, heritage-focused, and print media content

#### Native

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "numerals_format": "native",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

#### International

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.3. Output Script Feature

The `output_script` parameter controls how the translated text is **transliterated**, i.e., how it appears in different scripts while keeping pronunciation intact.

#### Transliteration Options:

1. **Default (null)** – No transliteration applied.
   Example: "आपका Rs. 3000 का EMI pending है।"
   Best for modern, mixed-language content.

2. **Roman** – Converts the output into Romanized Hindi.
   Example: "aapka Rs. 3000 ka EMI pending hai."
   Ideal for users who can speak but not read native scripts.

3. **Fully-Native** – Uses formal native script transliteration.
   Example: "आपका रु. 3000 का ई.एम.ऐ. पेंडिंग है।"
   Best for official documents and structured writing.

4. **Spoken-Form-in-Native** – Uses native script but mimics spoken style.
   Example: "आपका थ्री थाउजेंड रूपीस का ईएमअइ पेंडिंग है।"
   Ideal for voice assistants, conversational AI, and informal speech.

**When to Use What?**

- **Default** – For natural, mixed-language modern writing
- **Roman** – For users unfamiliar with native scripts
- **Fully-Native** – For formal, structured translations
- **Spoken-Form-in-Native** – For casual speech and voice applications

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "output_script":"roman",
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

```python
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "output_script":"spoken-form-in-native",
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

```python
# Create the request payload
payload = {
    "source_language_code": "en-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker_gender": "Female",
    "mode": "modern-colloquial",
    "model": "mayura:v1",
    "enable_preprocessing": False,
    "output_script":"fully-native",
    "numerals_format": "international",
    "input": full_text
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    translated_text = response.json().get("translated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("\n=== Translated Text ===\n", translated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

2. **Replace the placeholder key**: In the code below, replace "YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

```python
SARVAM_AI_API="YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY"
```

### 2.1 Setting Up the API Endpoint and Payload

This section defines the API endpoint and the payload for the translation request. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API key and desired parameters.

```python
# API endpoint for speech-to-text translation
api_url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text-translate"

# Headers containing the API subscription key
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_AI_API  # Replace with your API key
}

# Data payload for the translation request
data = {
    "model": "saaras:v2",  # Specify the model to be used
    "with_diarization": False  # Set to True for speaker diarization
}
```

## 3. Uploading Audio Files

To translate audio, you need to upload a `.wav` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your audio file**: Ensure your audio file is in `.wav` format. If your file is in a different format, you can use tools like `pydub` to convert it.
2. **Upload the file**: If you're using Google Colab, you can upload the file using the file uploader:

```python
from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()
audio_file_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]  # Get the name of the uploaded file
```

If you're working locally, ensure the file is in the same directory as your notebook and specify the file name:

```python
audio_file_path = "test.wav"  # Replace with your file name
```

## 4. Speech-to-Text Translation API

This section demonstrates how to use the *STT-Translate API* for translating audio files into text using *Saaras*. The API automatically identifies the language of the audio and supports long audio files by splitting them into chunks.

### 4.1. Splitting Audio into Chunks

The `split_audio` function splits an audio file into smaller chunks of a specified duration. This is useful for processing long audio files that exceed the API's input length limit.

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

def split_audio(audio_path, chunk_duration_ms):
    """
    Splits an audio file into smaller chunks of specified duration.

    Args:
        audio_path (str): Path to the audio file to be split.
        chunk_duration_ms (int): Duration of each chunk in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        list: A list of AudioSegment objects representing the audio chunks.
    """
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)  # Load the audio file
    chunks = []
    if len(audio) > chunk_duration_ms:
        # Split the audio into chunks of the specified duration
        for i in range(0, len(audio), chunk_duration_ms):
            chunks.append(audio[i:i + chunk_duration_ms])
    else:
        # If the audio is shorter than the chunk duration, use the entire audio
        chunks.append(audio)
    return chunks
```

### 4.2. Translating Audio

The `translate_audio` function translates audio chunks using the Saaras API. It handles the API request for each chunk and collates the results.

```python
def translate_audio(audio_file_path, api_url, headers, data, chunk_duration_ms=5*60*1000):
    """
    Translates audio into text with optional diarization and timestamps.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): Path to the audio file.
        api_url (str): API endpoint URL for Speech-to-Text and Translate.
        headers (dict): Headers for API authentication.
        data (dict): Payload containing model and other options like diarization.
        chunk_duration_ms (int): Duration of each audio chunk in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        dict: Collated response containing the transcript and word-level timestamps.
    """
    # Split the audio into chunks
    chunks = split_audio(audio_file_path, chunk_duration_ms)
    responses = []

    # Process each chunk
    for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        # Export the chunk to a BytesIO object (in-memory binary stream)
        chunk_buffer = io.BytesIO()
        chunk.export(chunk_buffer, format="wav")
        chunk_buffer.seek(0)  # Reset the pointer to the start of the stream

        # Prepare the file for the API request
        files = {'file': ('audiofile.wav', chunk_buffer, 'audio/wav')}

        try:
            # Make the POST request to the API
            response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, files=files, data=data)
            if response.status_code == 200 or response.status_code == 201:
                print(f"Chunk {idx} POST Request Successful!")
                response_data = response.json()
                transcript = response_data.get("transcript", "")
                responses.append({"transcript": transcript})
            else:
                # Handle failed requests
                print(f"Chunk {idx} POST Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
                print("Response:", response.text)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any exceptions during the request
            print(f"Error processing chunk {idx}: {e}")
        finally:
            # Ensure the buffer is closed after processing
            chunk_buffer.close()

    # Collate the transcriptions from all chunks
    collated_transcript = " ".join([resp["transcript"] for resp in responses])
    collated_response = {
        "transcript": collated_transcript,
        "language": response_data.get("language_code")
    }
    return collated_response
```

### 4.3 Translating the Audio

This section calls the `translate_audio` function to translate the audio file. Replace `audio_file_path` with the path to your audio file.

```python
# Path to the audio file to be translated
# audio_file_path = "test.wav"  # Replace with your file path

# Translate the audio
translation = translate_audio(audio_file_path, api_url, headers, data)

# Display the translation results
translation
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "transcript": "There are many ethical stories in English that are beneficial for children. They activate your child's imagination, entertain them, and make them happy. Short ethical stories are ideal to keep them focused and focused throughout the story.",
  "language": "hi-IN"
}
```

    # Collate the transcriptions from all chunks
    collated_responses = {"collated_transcript": " ".join([i["transcript"] for i in responses])}
    return collated_responses
```

## 6. Transcribe the Audio

This section calls the `transcribe_audio_chunks` function to transcribe the audio file. Replace `audio_file_path` with the path to your audio file.

```python
# Path to the audio file to be transcribed
# audio_file_path = "test.wav"  # Replace with your file path

# Display the transcription results
transcriptions
```

## 6. Explanation of the Output

The output of the `transcribe_audio_chunks` function is a dictionary containing the collated transcript of the entire audio file. If the audio was split into multiple chunks, the transcripts from all chunks are combined into a single string.

Example output:

```json
{
    "collated_transcript": "This is the transcribed text from the audio file."
}
```

## 4. Basic Usage

### 4.1. Read the Document

We have two sample documents under the `data` folder:

- `sample1.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in English.
- `sample2.txt` contains an essay on _The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society_ in Hindi.

```python
def read_file(file_path, lang_name):
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            # Read the first 5 lines
            lines = [next(file) for _ in range(5)]
            print(f"=== {lang_name} Text (First Few Lines) ===")
            print("".join(lines))  # Print first few lines

            # Read the remaining content
            remaining_text = file.read()

            # Combine all text
            full_doc = "".join(lines) + remaining_text

            # Count total characters
            total_chars = len(full_doc)
            print(f"\nTotal number of characters in {lang_name} file:", total_chars)

            return full_doc
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while reading {file_path}: {e}")
        return None
```

```python
# Read English and Hindi documents
english_doc = read_file("data/sample1.txt", "English")
hindi_doc = read_file("data/sample2.txt", "Hindi")
```

### 4.2. Split the text into chunks

Since the API has a restriction of 1000 characters per request, we need to split the text accordingly.

```python
def chunk_text(text, max_length=1000):
    """Splits text into chunks of at most max_length characters while preserving word boundaries."""
    chunks = []

    while len(text) > max_length:
        split_index = text.rfind(" ", 0, max_length)  # Find the last space within limit
        if split_index == -1:
            split_index = max_length  # No space found, force split at max_length

        chunks.append(text[:split_index].strip())  # Trim spaces before adding
        text = text[split_index:].lstrip()  # Remove leading spaces for the next chunk

    if text:
        chunks.append(text.strip())  # Add the last chunk

    return chunks
```

```python
# Split the text
english_text_chunks = chunk_text(english_doc)

# Display chunk info
print(f"Total Chunks: {len(english_text_chunks)}")
for i, chunk in enumerate(english_text_chunks[:3], 1):  # Show only first 3 chunks for preview
    print(f"\n=== Chunk {i} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ===\n{chunk}")
```

```python
# Split the text
hindi_text_chunks = chunk_text(english_doc)

# Display chunk info
print(f"Total Chunks: {len(hindi_text_chunks)}")
for i, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks[:3], 1):  # Show only first 3 chunks for preview
    print(f"\n=== Chunk {i} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ===\n{chunk}")
```

### 4.3. Setting up the API Endpoint

```python
import requests

# Define API request details
url = "https://api.sarvam.ai/transliterate"
headers = {
    "api-subscription-key": SARVAM_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

```python
# Send requests for each chunk
translated_texts = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(hindi_text_chunks):
    payload = {
        "input": chunk,
        "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
        "spoken_form": True,
        "numerals_format": "international"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        translated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
        translated_texts.append(translated_text)
        print(f"\n=== Translated Chunk {idx + 1} ===\n{translated_text}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Combine all translated chunks
final_translation = "\n".join(translated_texts)
print("\n=== Final Translated Text ===")
print(final_translation)
```

## 5. Experimenting with Different Options

We currently have three different transliteration models:

### 5.1. Romanization (Indic → Latin Script)

- Converts Indic scripts to Roman script (English alphabet).
- Example: `मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ` → `main office ja raha hun`
- Parameters:
  - `source_language_code = "hi-IN"`
  - `target_language_code = "en-IN"`

```python
# Define the payload for Romanization (Hindi to Latin script)
payload = {
    "input": "मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "en-IN",
    "spoken_form": True
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.2. Conversion to Indic Scripts

- Converts text into an Indic script from various sources:

  - **Code-mixed text**

    - Example: `मैं office जा रहा हूँ` → `मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ`
    - Parameters:
      - `source_language_code = "hi-IN"`
      - `target_language_code = "hi-IN"`

  - **Romanized text**

    - Example: `main office ja raha hun` → `मैं ऑफिस जा रहा हूँ`
    - Parameters:
      - `source_language_code = "hi-IN"`
      - `target_language_code = "hi-IN"`

  - **English text**
    - Example: `I am going to office` → `आइ ऍम गोइंग टू ऑफिस`
    - Parameters:
      - `source_language_code = "en-IN"`
      - `target_language_code = "hi-IN"`

```python
payload = {
    "input": "main office ja raha hun",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 5.3. Spoken Indic Form

- Converts written text into a more natural spoken form.
- Example: `मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है` → `मुझे कल सुबह साढ़े नौ बजे अपॉइंटमेंट है`

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## 6. Advanced Features

- **`numerals_format`** – Choose between **international (0-9)** or **native (१-९)** numbers.
- **`spoken_form_numerals_language`** – Choose whether numbers should be spoken in **English** or the **native language**.

### 6.1. Numerals Format

`numerals_format` is an optional parameter with two options:

- **`international`** (default): Uses regular numerals (0-9).
- **`native`**: Uses language-specific native numerals.

#### Example:

- If `international` format is selected → `मेरा phone number है: 9840950950`.
- If `native` format is selected → `मेरा phone number है: ९८४०९५०९५०`.

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
    "numerals_format": "native"
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

### 6.2. Spoken Form Numerals Language

`spoken_form_numerals_language` is an optional parameter with two options and only works when `spoken_form` is **true**:

- **`english`**: Numbers in the text will be spoken in **English**.
- **`native (default)`**: Numbers in the text will be spoken in the **native language**.

#### Example:

**Input:** `"मेरे पास ₹200 है"`

- If `english` format is selected → `"मेरे पास टू हन्डर्ड रूपीस है"`.
- If `native` format is selected → `"मेरे पास दो सौ रुपये है"`.

```python
payload = {
    "input": "मुझे कल 9:30am को appointment है",
    "source_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "spoken_form": True,
    "spoken_form_numerals_language": "english"
}

# Send the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Extract the transliterated text
if response.status_code == 200:
    transliterated_text = response.json().get("transliterated_text", "Translation not available")
    print("Romanized Text:", transliterated_text)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## AI Agents & Automation

### Voice AI
*By Gustaf Alströmer*

Humans interact with businesses in many ways, but one way hasn't changed much in almost 100 years—and that's phone calls. You probably have experienced long wait times, voice trees, the press star or pound. In the end, we always want to talk to a human agent because the alternatives are just not that great.

But the new voice models and conversational LLMs are now incredibly good. And startups who take advantage of them are are now making voice AI bots that are indistinguishable from humans. It's pretty amazing and the unlock was the quality of these models.

Today, over a trillion calls exist between a business and a customer. What we like to do at YC is to peek into the future, and talking to a voice AI bot feels like experiencing the future - similar to how it felt to ride an autonomous car for the first time - it just works.

Despite decades of productivity apps, emails still pile up, calendars get full, and tasks remain undone. Even the best organizational tools only help us keep track of what needs to get done—they don't actually do it. With recent advances in LLMs, we now have the potential to go from "to-do" lists to "done" lists"

I'd love to work with startups building the next generation of AI personal assistant: an LLM-powered system that deeply understands your work, routines, communication history, and personal preferences. Imagine an AI that has perfect memory of your personal correspondence, projects, and scheduling preferences— and can take action on your behalf.

Think of an assistant that knows how you typically respond to certain kinds of emails and can draft those responses for you—or even send them with your approval. It understands which meetings you usually accept and which you decline, and that can auto-schedule your week in a way that optimises your productivity and minimises travel. It keeps track of tasks you've completed in the past and how you approach new ones, so it can handle recurring processes without your constant input.

This is more than just filtering messages or auto-filling your calendar. I want to see a system that truly does the tasks a human personal assistant or chief of staff might otherwise do, allowing you to focus on the work that matters most.

### AI Personal Tutor for Everyone
*By Harj Taggar*

The idea of using computers to help people learn things has been a dream of computer nerds going back to the 1940's with Vannevar Bush's Memex idea, JCR Licklider's "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper in the 60's, and Alan Kay's Dynabook proposal in the 70's.

The holy grail has been to build a personalized learning experience for everyone but in practice, that's been hard to build. Most online education products deliver the same content to everyone who signs up for a course.

And today, with AI, we think it's finally possible to build a truly personal tutor for everyone. The latest reasoning capabilities let them break down complex topics step by step, in a way that should help explain even the most complicated subjects in a straightforward way.

With the latest foundation models being multimodal, they can now present these concepts by generating animations, manipulating 3D objects, and explaining concepts with voice.

We've already seen the impact that one great teacher, like Grant Sanderson and his 3blue1brown YouTube videos, can have on making it easy to understand complex ideas using beautiful visualizations and animations. Now imagine having that same quality of explanation available for every topic, personalized to each learner's needs, with an interactive AI tutor. This could really change the world.

If you're working on using AI to create personalized learning tools for anything, we'd love to hear from you.

### The Future of Education
*By Tom Blomfield*

Education is one of the world's largest and most important industries, yet it's also one of the most difficult to disrupt. About 100 million people are employed in education today, and about 1.5bn students are being educated every year. Traditional ways of teaching and learning have remained largely unchanged for decades, but things might be starting to shift.

The rise of AI—particularly large language models—promises to reshape how we teach, learn, and measure outcomes. These technologies have the potential to significantly improve educational access, personalize instruction, and free both teachers and learners from drudgery.

We're just starting to see new personalized study tools for students and grading platforms for teachers, but we're still very early in figuring out what AI can truly achieve here. One big challenge is figuring out the business model - while more than a billion people are engaged in education, budgets are notoriously tight, and purchasing cycles are horrendously slow.

If you fast-forward 10 or 20 years, it's impossible to believe that education is still going to be done in the same way it is today.

### AI Voice Assistants for Email
*By Tyler Bosmeny*

I want to meet teams who can help me process my inbox – with just my voice.

You see, every day I drive to work for 20 minutes, and every day I wish I could be using that time to triage emails, draft replies, delegate scheduling. What if we could all arrive at work each day already at Inbox Zero?

If you've used things like Vapi, Retell, or even ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, you know how good these voice agents are today. The use cases are far bigger than just driving. I know firsthand - It took me experiencing nerve damage in my arms to realize how much we still rely on keyboards for even the most basic tasks.

And email just might be the perfect starting place to build the most useful all-purpose assistant. Anyone with access to my inbox instantly knows my friends, my plans, my writing style, and so much more.

If you're an ambitious team interested in working on this, I'm interested in working with you.

### AI for Personal Finance
*By Gustaf Alströmer*

Most humans are not rational about their finances. But just being alive comes with a set of decisions you need to make about your finances. How much should I save for the future, where should I invest my money to take the right risk, and how should I think about debt and taxes? How you answer these questions today will impact your freedom to do the things you want in the future.

Until today, the answers have generally been asking friends, googling, hiring a financial advisor or maybe even asking your bank.

These options aren't great. They are filled with bias and don't have the full picture of your financial situation and goals. And hiring a great financial advisor is very expensive.

With LLMs, there is a unique opportunity to build software that gives every person access to personalized finance, investment, and tax advice at near-zero cost. They would use API's to access your complete financial situation and give completely personal unbiased advice.

### AI Personal Staff for Everyone
*By David Lieb*

Software is a proven way to bring to everyone what only the rich could afford before. As recently as 2009, only the world's richest people could afford a private driver, but today, Uber, and now Waymo, have brought that to everyone. Another example: when I first started working on what would become Google Photos, I was surprised to learn that rich people hired actual human beings to go through all their photos and edit, label, and organize them. We built AI to automate that for billions of people.

Despite the explosion of software in the last decade, wealthy people still employ lots of human staff to provide personal services. These are things like tax accountants, personal lawyers, and money managers, but also personal trainers, private tutors, and even personal doctors. The list goes on and on. Why can only the rich afford this? Because software hasn't been able to replace these types of personalized knowledge work tasks…until now.

Over the next few years, we expect AI to get good enough to do most of these jobs. So if you are working to bring a part of this "personal AI staff" to every human on the planet, we'd love to hear from you.

### The Future of Software Engineering
*By Pete Koomen*

Language models can already write code better than most humans. This is going to bring the cost of building software down to zero.

So will agents kill the job of software developer? No! We'll need more human software engineers in the future because software is going to run almost everything.

These humans won't write much code directly. Instead, they'll manage teams of agents that build software for them. In addition to writing code, agents will perform most of the other specialized tasks required to build software: QA, deployment, security & compliance audits, translations, operations, etc.

We'd like to fund startups that enable small groups of generalist software developers to manage large teams of agents working together to build and ship lots of software.

If you're interested in building tools for the future of software engineering, we'd love to hear from you.

### B2A: Software Where the Customers Will All Be Agents
*By Dalton Caldwell*

A significant percentage of internet traffic consists of non-humans scraping and looking for information. These programs often end up impersonating humans to fill out forms or look for changes, most people build websites with human users in mind rather than scrapers.

With the advent of AI and agents, it seems like it's a good idea to build software and services where agents as customers are actively supported and documented rather than an edge case.

For example, APIs to help agents pay for hosting credits, or book travel, or engage into contracts with other parties. In the stock market, it's well understood that humans and programs are trading together, and in the future, this will only increase.

If you want to build services specifically aimed at best serving agents, we want to hear from you.

### Vertical AI Agents
*By Jared Friedman*

From 2005-2020, the invention of the interactive web application enabled a massive wave of B2B SaaS companies. Over 100 B2B SaaS unicorns were started, and nearly half of all venture funding went to this category.

It seems likely that for the next decade, we will see a parallel wave of companies building vertical AI agents.

What is a vertical AI agent? It's software that's built on top of LLMs that's been carefully tuned to be able to automate some kind of real, important work. In recent batches, we've had YC companies build an AI tax accountant, an AI medical biller, an AI phone support agent, an AI compliance agent, an AI quality assurance tester.

Some people previously derided ideas like this as "ChatGPT wrappers" but no one who has tried to deploy a system like this to production thinks so. Building systems like this that work in real-world conditions requires real agentic architectures, integrations with legacy systems, and deep domain understanding.

It's hard to get systems like this working right, but once you do, the growth can be phenomenal. The value prop of B2B SaaS was to make human workers incrementally more efficient. The value prop of vertical AI agents is to automate the work entirely. Vertical AI agents that reach human-level performance grow extremely quickly.

It's entirely possible this opportunity is big enough to mint another 100 unicorns. For every category with a successful B2B SaaS company, you could imagine an ever larger vertical AI company being built.

While many founders are already working on these ideas in the most obvious categories, we think it's still relatively undiscovered compared to the size of the opportunity, and there are many large categories still untouched.

### Inference AI Infrastructure in the World of Test-Time Compute
*By Diana Hu*

Until recently compute spend went into pre-training foundation models. But now with Deepseek R1 and OpenAI o1 and o3, there is a new scaling trend that suggests we'll need far more compute at inference time when AI apps actually use these models.

As AI apps 10x or even 100x the number of API calls to complex reasoning models, the infrastructure costs will become a real problem.

That's where new startups come in. There's room to rebuild the stack here: better software at inference-layer tooling, cheaper ways to handle GPU workloads, and optimizations that let AI apps scale without bleeding money.

It's the kind of unsexy-but-critical problem that often creates big opportunities.

**Core Principle**: Enhance local AI capabilities through cloud-based RAG training using only anonymized, non-personal operational data while maintaining complete user privacy.

### Data Flow Architecture

```
📱 LOCAL DEVICE (Private Data - Never Shared):
  ├── Financial transactions and patterns
  ├── Educational learning progress  
  ├── Emotional conversation history
  ├── Cultural preferences and context
  └── Personal behavioral patterns

     ↓ (Only Anonymous Operational Data)

☁️ CLOUD RAG SYSTEM (Anonymous Data Only):
  ├── Usage patterns: "Feature X used Y times"
  ├── Performance metrics: "Response time: 2.3s"
  ├── Error logs: "Classification failed - Category Z"
  ├── Success patterns: "Method A preferred over B"
  └── System optimization data

     ↓ (Enhanced Model Updates)

📱 LOCAL AI ENHANCEMENT:
  ├── Improved categorization algorithms
  ├── Better response generation models
  ├── Enhanced cultural intelligence
  └── Optimized performance patterns
```

### Implementation Strategy

| Component | Local Processing | Cloud RAG Training | Privacy Protection |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Financial AI** | All transaction analysis local | Anonymous spending category success rates | Zero transaction content shared |

```

## 🎯 **SaaS Architecture Principles**

### **Multi-Tenancy Design**

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**: Shared Database, Isolated Schemas

```sql
-- Tenant isolation at database level
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_123456;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_789012;

-- All tables prefixed with tenant context
CREATE TABLE tenant_123456.user_conversations (...);
CREATE TABLE tenant_123456.financial_transactions (...);
```

**Benefits**:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure resources
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Maintenance**: Single codebase for all tenants
- **Compliance**: Tenant data isolation for privacy

### **API-First Design**

**RESTful API Architecture**:
```
/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/
├── /ai/chat                    # Soch AI interactions
├── /finance/transactions       # Mudra financial data
├── /education/sessions         # Sikshak learning data
├── /users/profiles             # User management
└── /analytics/insights         # Usage analytics
```

**GraphQL Layer** (Phase 2):
- Unified data access across all modules
- Tenant-aware query resolution
- Real-time subscriptions for AI interactions

## 🤖 **AI Platform Architecture (Soch Core)**

### **Unified AI Processing Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B{Input Type}
    B -->|Voice| C[Saarika STT]
    B -->|Text| D[Text Processing]
    C --> E[Sarvam AI Processing]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Context Management]
    F --> G[Response Generation]
    G --> H[Bulbul TTS]
    G --> I[Text Response]
    H --> J[Voice Output]
    I --> K[Module-Specific Action]
    J --> K
```

### **Cross-Module Intelligence**

**Shared Context Architecture**:
```typescript
interface AIContext {
  tenantId: string;
  userId: string;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  culturalProfile: CulturalContext;
  financialContext?: MudraContext;
  educationalContext?: SikshakContext;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Contextual Continuity**: AI remembers across modules
- **Cultural Consistency**: Same cultural intelligence everywhere
- **Resource Efficiency**: Single AI engine for all features

## 💰 **Module Architecture**

## 🔄 RAG-BASED CLOUD AI MODEL TRAINING ARCHITECTURE

### Privacy-Preserving Learning Framework

**Core Principle**: Enhance local AI capabilities through cloud-based RAG training using only anonymized, non-personal operational data while maintaining complete user privacy.

### Data Flow Architecture

```
📱 LOCAL DEVICE (Private Data - Never Shared):
  ├── Financial transactions and patterns
  ├── Educational learning progress  
  ├── Emotional conversation history
  ├── Cultural preferences and context
  └── Personal behavioral patterns

     ↓ (Only Anonymous Operational Data)

☁️ CLOUD RAG SYSTEM (Anonymous Data Only):
  ├── Usage patterns: "Feature X used Y times"
  ├── Performance metrics: "Response time: 2.3s"
  ├── Error logs: "Classification failed - Category Z"
  ├── Success patterns: "Method A preferred over B"
  └── System optimization data

     ↓ (Enhanced Model Updates)

📱 LOCAL AI ENHANCEMENT:
  ├── Improved categorization algorithms
  ├── Better response generation models
  ├── Enhanced cultural intelligence
  └── Optimized performance patterns
```

### Implementation Strategy

| Component | Local Processing | Cloud RAG Training | Privacy Protection |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Financial AI** | All transaction analysis local | Anonymous spending category success rates | Zero transaction content shared |
| **Educational AI** | All learning progress local | Anonymous learning effectiveness patterns | Zero personal learning data shared |
| **Conversational AI** | All emotional analysis local | Anonymous conversation flow optimization | Zero conversation content shared |
| **Voice Processing** | Progressive local transition | Anonymous accuracy improvement patterns | Zero voice data retention |

### Anonymous Data Examples

**What Gets Sent to Cloud RAG:**
- "SMS parsing accuracy: 94% for Indian banks"
- "User preferred categorization method B over A"
- "Response time improved from 3s to 2s after optimization"
- "Cultural adaptation successful in 87% of interactions"
- "Error: Unable to parse transaction format XYZ"

**What NEVER Gets Sent:**
- Transaction amounts, merchants, or details
- Personal conversation content or emotional states
- Individual learning progress or educational content
- Voice recordings or transcripts
- Personal preferences or behavioral patterns

// Custom metrics for AI processing
import prometheus from 'prom-client';

const aiProcessingTime = new prometheus.Histogram({
  name: 'ai_processing_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of AI processing requests',
  labelNames: ['tenant_id', 'model', 'language']
});

const culturalAccuracy = new prometheus.Gauge({
  name: 'cultural_context_accuracy',
  help: 'Accuracy of cultural context detection',
  labelNames: ['tenant_id', 'language', 'cultural_marker']
});

// Middleware for AI request monitoring
const monitorAIRequest = (req, res, next) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000;
    aiProcessingTime
      .labels(req.tenantId, req.body.model, req.body.language)
      .observe(duration);
  });
  
  next();
};
```

## 🔒 **Security & Privacy Architecture**

### **Zero-Trust Security Model**

```typescript
// Request authentication and authorization
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { RateLimiter } from 'rate-limiter-flexible';

const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
  keyGenerator: (req) => `${req.tenantId}:${req.ip}`,
  points: 100, // Number of requests
  duration: 60, // Per 60 seconds
});

const authenticateRequest = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Extract and verify JWT
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    
    // Tenant isolation
    req.tenantId = decoded.tenant_id;
    req.userId = decoded.user_id;
    
    // Rate limiting per tenant
    await rateLimiter.consume(`${req.tenantId}:${req.ip}`);
    
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
};
```

### **Data Encryption Strategy**

```typescript
// Client-side encryption for sensitive data
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';

class PrivacyManager {
  private static encryptionKey: string;
  
  static encryptSensitiveData(data: any): string {
    return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
      JSON.stringify(data), 
      this.encryptionKey
    ).toString();
  }
  
  static decryptSensitiveData(encryptedData: string): any {
    const bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, this.encryptionKey);
    return JSON.parse(bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));
  }
  
  // Financial data never leaves device unencrypted
  static storeFinancialData(transaction: Transaction): void {
    const encrypted = this.encryptSensitiveData(transaction);
    AsyncStorage.setItem(`tx_${transaction.id}`, encrypted);
  }
}
```

---

## 📊 **Performance & Scalability**

### **Caching Strategy**

```typescript
// Multi-layer caching for optimal performance
class CacheManager {
  private redis: Redis;
  private memoryCache: LRUCache;
  
  async getAIResponse(key: string): Promise<AIResponse | null> {
    // Level 1: Memory cache (fastest)
    let result = this.memoryCache.get(key);
    if (result) return result;
    
    // Level 2: Redis cache
    result = await this.redis.get(key);
    if (result) {
      this.memoryCache.set(key, result);
      return JSON.parse(result);
    }
    
    return null;
  }
  
  async cacheAIResponse(key: string, response: AIResponse): Promise<void> {
    // Cache with appropriate TTL based on content type
    const ttl = this.getTTL(response.type);
    
    this.memoryCache.set(key, response, ttl);
    await this.redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(response));
  }
}
```

### **Database Optimization**

```sql
-- Performance indexes for multi-tenant queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_conversations_tenant_user 
ON conversations (tenant_id, user_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_transactions_tenant_date 
ON financial_transactions (tenant_id, transaction_date DESC);

-- Partitioning for large datasets
CREATE TABLE conversations_2025_06 PARTITION OF conversations
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-06-01') TO ('2025-07-01');

-- Materialized views for analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW tenant_usage_stats AS
SELECT 
  tenant_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  AVG(processing_time) as avg_response_time,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour
FROM ai_requests
GROUP BY tenant_id, DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at);
```

---

## 🌍 **Global Scalability Features**

### **Internationalization Support**

```typescript
// Dynamic language loading for global expansion
class LocalizationManager {
  private static loadedLanguages = new Map<string, any>();
  
  static async loadLanguage(languageCode: string): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.loadedLanguages.has(languageCode)) {
      const translations = await import(`../locales/${languageCode}.json`);
      this.loadedLanguages.set(languageCode, translations);
    }
  }
  
  static translate(key: string, language: string, params?: any): string {
    const translations = this.loadedLanguages.get(language);
    let text = translations?.[key] || key;
    
    // Parameter substitution
    if (params) {
      Object.keys(params).forEach(param => {
        text = text.replace(`{{${param}}}`, params[param]);
      });
    }
    
    return text;
  }
}
```

### **Regional Deployment Strategy**

```yaml
# Terraform configuration for multi-region deployment
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "assistantpro" {
  for_each = toset(["us-west-2", "ap-south-1", "eu-west-1"])
  
  name = "assistantpro-${each.value}"

// Database migration with tenant awareness
class MigrationManager {
  async runMigration(migrationId: string): Promise<void> {
    const tenants = await this.getAllTenants();
    
    for (const tenant of tenants) {
      try {
        await this.runTenantMigration(tenant.id, migrationId);
        await this.recordMigration(tenant.id, migrationId);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Migration failed for tenant ${tenant.id}:`, error);
        // Rollback strategy
        await this.rollbackTenantMigration(tenant.id, migrationId);
      }
    }
  }
  
  private async runTenantMigration(tenantId: string, migrationId: string): Promise<void> {
    const schema = `tenant_${tenantId}`;

## 📚 Educational Vision

The idea of using computers to help people learn things has been a dream of computer nerds going back to the 1940's with Vannevar Bush's Memex idea, JCR Licklider's "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper in the 60's, and Alan Kay's Dynabook proposal in the 70's.

The holy grail has been to build a personalized learning experience for everyone but in practice, that's been hard to build. Most online education products deliver the same content to everyone who signs up for a course.

And today, with AI, we think it's finally possible to build a truly personal tutor for everyone. The latest reasoning capabilities let them break down complex topics step by step, in a way that should help explain even the most complicated subjects in a straightforward way.

With the latest foundation models being multimodal, they can now present these concepts by generating animations, manipulating 3D objects, and explaining concepts with voice.

We've already seen the impact that one great teacher, like Grant Sanderson and his 3blue1brown YouTube videos, can have on making it easy to understand complex ideas using beautiful visualizations and animations. Now imagine having that same quality of explanation available for every topic, personalized to each learner's needs, with an interactive AI tutor. This could really change the world.

## 📚 Educational Vision

The idea of using computers to help people learn things has been a dream of computer nerds going back to the 1940's with Vannevar Bush's Memex idea, JCR Licklider's "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper in the 60's, and Alan Kay's Dynabook proposal in the 70's.

The holy grail has been to build a personalized learning experience for everyone but in practice, that's been hard to build. Most online education products deliver the same content to everyone who signs up for a course.

And today, with AI, we think it's finally possible to build a truly personal tutor for everyone. The latest reasoning capabilities let them break down complex topics step by step, in a way that should help explain even the most complicated subjects in a straightforward way.

With the latest foundation models being multimodal, they can now present these concepts by generating animations, manipulating 3D objects, and explaining concepts with voice.

We've already seen the impact that one great teacher, like Grant Sanderson and his 3blue1brown YouTube videos, can have on making it easy to understand complex ideas using beautiful visualizations and animations. Now imagine having that same quality of explanation available for every topic, personalized to each learner's needs, with an interactive AI tutor. This could really change the world.

## Implementation

### Sarvam AI Technology Stack

**Sarvam-M Model Overview**

Sarvam-M, the flagship large language model (LLM) from Sarvam AI, is primarily a text-based AI model designed for advanced reasoning, chatbots, translation, and educational tools in Indian languages. While Sarvam AI as a platform offers robust speech technologies—including speech-to-text (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) APIs—the Sarvam-M model itself does not natively perform direct speech-to-speech (voice-to-voice) responses. However, Sarvam-M can be integrated into a speech-to-speech pipeline using Sarvam AI's broader suite of tools.

### Details

**Sarvam-M Model Capabilities**

- Sarvam-M is a 24-billion-parameter hybrid language model focused on Indian languages, math, and programming
- Its primary functions are text-based: chatbots, translation, and reasoning tasks
- The model is accessible via API and Hugging Face for developers to build upon

**Sarvam AI Speech Technologies**

Sarvam AI offers specialized APIs for speech processing:

- **Saarika**: Speech-to-text (ASR) in multiple Indian languages
- **Bulbul**: Text-to-speech (TTS) with natural-sounding voices in Indian languages
- **Saaras**: ASR-Translate, which converts speech to text and translates it between Indian languages

These APIs enable developers to build voice-first applications, including call center bots and multilingual assistants. Sarvam AI's platform is described as "voice-enabled" and "voice-first," emphasizing its commitment to speech interfaces.

### Speech-to-Speech Response Workflow

While Sarvam-M itself does not process audio directly, a speech-to-speech response system can be constructed by chaining Sarvam AI's APIs:

1. **Speech Input**: User speaks; audio is converted to text using Saarika (ASR)
2. **Text Processing**: The transcribed text is fed to Sarvam-M for understanding, reasoning, or generating a response
3. **Speech Output**: Sarvam-M's text response is converted back to speech using Bulbul (TTS)

This modular approach allows for a seamless speech-to-speech user experience, even though Sarvam-M's core function is text-based.

### Multilingual and Natural Voice Support

- Sarvam AI supports natural, familiar speech in 11 Indian languages, with authentic accents
- The speech APIs are designed to sound "just like India," not robotic

### Implementation Conclusion

- Sarvam-M does not natively support direct speech-to-speech (voice-to-voice) response
- However, Sarvam AI's platform provides all the necessary components—high-quality speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs—so developers can easily build a speech-to-speech pipeline using Sarvam-M for the core language understanding and generation step
- This enables applications such as voice bots, call center agents, and multilingual conversational assistants for Indian languages

## 📊 **Performance Optimization**

### **Caching Strategy**

```typescript
// Intelligent caching for Sarvam AI responses
export class SarvamCacheManager {
  private cache: Redis;
  
  async getCachedTranslation(
    text: string, 
    sourceLang: string, 
    targetLang: string
  ): Promise<TranslationResult | null> {
    const key = `translation:${this.hashText(text)}:${sourceLang}:${targetLang}`;
    const cached = await this.cache.get(key);
    return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
  }
  
  async cacheTranslation(
    text: string,
    sourceLang: string,
    targetLang: string,
    result: TranslationResult
  ): Promise<void> {
    const key = `translation:${this.hashText(text)}:${sourceLang}:${targetLang}`;
    // Cache translations for 7 days
    await this.cache.setex(key, 604800, JSON.stringify(result));
  }
  
  // Smart caching based on content type
  private getCacheTTL(contentType: string): number {
    const ttlMap = {
      'translation': 604800,    // 7 days
      'tts': 86400,            // 1 day
      'chat_general': 3600,    // 1 hour
      'chat_personal': 300     // 5 minutes
    };
    return ttlMap[contentType] || 3600;
  }
}
```

// Robust rate limiting and error handling
export class SarvamRateLimiter {
  private limits = {
    'speech-to-text': { requests: 100, window: 60000 },
    'text-to-speech': { requests: 50, window: 60000 },
    'translation': { requests: 200, window: 60000 },
    'chat': { requests: 30, window: 60000 }
  };
  
  async checkRateLimit(endpoint: string, tenantId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const key = `rate_limit:${endpoint}:${tenantId}`;
    const current = await this.redis.incr(key);
    
    if (current === 1) {
      await this.redis.expire(key, this.limits[endpoint].window / 1000);
    }
    
    return current <= this.limits[endpoint].requests;
  }
  
  // Exponential backoff for retries
  async withRetry<T>(
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    maxRetries: number = 3
  ): Promise<T> {
    let lastError: Error;
    
    for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
      try {
        return await operation();
      } catch (error) {
        lastError = error;
        
        if (attempt < maxRetries - 1) {
          const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
        }
      }
    }
    
    throw lastError;

## Implementation

### Sarvam AI Technology Stack

**Sarvam-M Model Overview**

Sarvam-M, the flagship large language model (LLM) from Sarvam AI, is primarily a text-based AI model designed for advanced reasoning, chatbots, translation, and educational tools in Indian languages. While Sarvam AI as a platform offers robust speech technologies—including speech-to-text (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) APIs—the Sarvam-M model itself does not natively perform direct speech-to-speech (voice-to-voice) responses. However, Sarvam-M can be integrated into a speech-to-speech pipeline using Sarvam AI's broader suite of tools.

### Details

**Sarvam-M Model Capabilities**

- Sarvam-M is a 24-billion-parameter hybrid language model focused on Indian languages, math, and programming
- Its primary functions are text-based: chatbots, translation, and reasoning tasks
- The model is accessible via API and Hugging Face for developers to build upon

**Sarvam AI Speech Technologies**

Sarvam AI offers specialized APIs for speech processing:

- **Saarika**: Speech-to-text (ASR) in multiple Indian languages
- **Bulbul**: Text-to-speech (TTS) with natural-sounding voices in Indian languages
- **Saaras**: ASR-Translate, which converts speech to text and translates it between Indian languages

These APIs enable developers to build voice-first applications, including call center bots and multilingual assistants. Sarvam AI's platform is described as "voice-enabled" and "voice-first," emphasizing its commitment to speech interfaces.

### Speech-to-Speech Response Workflow

While Sarvam-M itself does not process audio directly, a speech-to-speech response system can be constructed by chaining Sarvam AI's APIs:

1. **Speech Input**: User speaks; audio is converted to text using Saarika (ASR)
2. **Text Processing**: The transcribed text is fed to Sarvam-M for understanding, reasoning, or generating a response
3. **Speech Output**: Sarvam-M's text response is converted back to speech using Bulbul (TTS)

This modular approach allows for a seamless speech-to-speech user experience, even though Sarvam-M's core function is text-based.

### Multilingual and Natural Voice Support

- Sarvam AI supports natural, familiar speech in 11 Indian languages, with authentic accents
- The speech APIs are designed to sound "just like India," not robotic

### Implementation Conclusion

- Sarvam-M does not natively support direct speech-to-speech (voice-to-voice) response
- However, Sarvam AI's platform provides all the necessary components—high-quality speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs—so developers can easily build a speech-to-speech pipeline using Sarvam-M for the core language understanding and generation step
- This enables applications such as voice bots, call center agents, and multilingual conversational assistants for Indian languages

```

## 🎯 **SaaS Architecture Principles**

### **Multi-Tenancy Design**

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**: Shared Database, Isolated Schemas

```sql
-- Tenant isolation at database level
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_123456;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_789012;

-- All tables prefixed with tenant context
CREATE TABLE tenant_123456.user_conversations (...);
CREATE TABLE tenant_123456.financial_transactions (...);
```

**Benefits**:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure resources
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Maintenance**: Single codebase for all tenants
- **Compliance**: Tenant data isolation for privacy

### **API-First Design**

**RESTful API Architecture**:
```
/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/
├── /ai/chat                    # Soch AI interactions
├── /finance/transactions       # Mudra financial data
├── /education/sessions         # Sikshak learning data
├── /users/profiles             # User management
└── /analytics/insights         # Usage analytics
```

**GraphQL Layer** (Phase 2):
- Unified data access across all modules
- Tenant-aware query resolution
- Real-time subscriptions for AI interactions

## 🤖 **AI Platform Architecture (Soch Core)**

### **Unified AI Processing Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B{Input Type}
    B -->|Voice| C[Saarika STT]
    B -->|Text| D[Text Processing]
    C --> E[Sarvam AI Processing]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Context Management]
    F --> G[Response Generation]
    G --> H[Bulbul TTS]
    G --> I[Text Response]
    H --> J[Voice Output]
    I --> K[Module-Specific Action]
    J --> K
```

### **Cross-Module Intelligence**

**Shared Context Architecture**:
```typescript
interface AIContext {
  tenantId: string;
  userId: string;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  culturalProfile: CulturalContext;
  financialContext?: MudraContext;
  educationalContext?: SikshakContext;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Contextual Continuity**: AI remembers across modules
- **Cultural Consistency**: Same cultural intelligence everywhere
- **Resource Efficiency**: Single AI engine for all features

### API Security Configuration
```javascript
// Express.js security middleware
const helmet = require('helmet');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

// Security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.sarvam.ai"]
    }
  }
}));

// Rate limiting adjusted for Indian usage patterns
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Development Environment
```bash
# Development deployment (staging)
export NODE_ENV=development
export API_URL=https://staging-api.assistantpro.in
export SARVAM_API_KEY=staging_key
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
export ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Production deployment
export NODE_ENV=production
export API_URL=https://api.assistantpro.in
export SARVAM_API_KEY=production_key
export LOG_LEVEL=error
export ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
export PRIVACY_MODE=strict
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback
```yaml
# Automated rollback on failure
rollback_conditions:
  - error_rate > 5%
  - response_time > 3000ms
  - user_complaints > 10/hour
  - security_alert: critical

rollback_process:
  1. Automatic traffic routing to previous version
  2. Database migration rollback (if needed)
  3. CDN cache invalidation
  4. Monitoring alert to team
  5. Post-incident analysis trigger
```

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Emergency rollback commands
# Mobile Apps
expo publish --release-channel production-rollback

# Web Platform
vercel --prod --target production-1.0.0

# Database
mysql -u admin -p assistantpro_prod < backup_pre_deployment.sql

# CDN Cache Clear
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/purge_cache" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"purge_everything":true}'
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
```javascript
// Automated health check endpoints
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  const health = {
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    checks: {
      database: checkDatabase(),
      sarvamAI: checkSarvamAI(),
      cache: checkRedis(),
      storage: checkFileSystem()
    }
  };
  
  const isHealthy = Object.values(health.checks).every(check => check.status === 'ok');
  res.status(isHealthy ? 200 : 503).json(health);
});
```

### Smoke Tests
```bash
# Post-deployment smoke tests
curl -f https://api.assistantpro.in/health
curl -f https://assistantpro.in/manifest.json
curl -f -H "Authorization: Bearer test_token" https://api.assistantpro.in/api/v1/soch/status
```

## 🎯 **SaaS Architecture Principles**

### **Multi-Tenancy Design**

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**: Shared Database, Isolated Schemas

```sql
-- Tenant isolation at database level
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_123456;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_789012;

-- All tables prefixed with tenant context
CREATE TABLE tenant_123456.user_conversations (...);
CREATE TABLE tenant_123456.financial_transactions (...);
```

**Benefits**:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure resources
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Maintenance**: Single codebase for all tenants
- **Compliance**: Tenant data isolation for privacy

### **API-First Design**

**RESTful API Architecture**:
```
/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/
├── /ai/chat                    # Soch AI interactions
├── /finance/transactions       # Mudra financial data
├── /education/sessions         # Sikshak learning data
├── /users/profiles             # User management
└── /analytics/insights         # Usage analytics
```

**GraphQL Layer** (Phase 2):
- Unified data access across all modules
- Tenant-aware query resolution
- Real-time subscriptions for AI interactions

## 🤖 **AI Platform Architecture (Soch Core)**

### **Unified AI Processing Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B{Input Type}
    B -->|Voice| C[Saarika STT]
    B -->|Text| D[Text Processing]
    C --> E[Sarvam AI Processing]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Context Management]
    F --> G[Response Generation]
    G --> H[Bulbul TTS]
    G --> I[Text Response]
    H --> J[Voice Output]
    I --> K[Module-Specific Action]
    J --> K
```

### **Cross-Module Intelligence**

**Shared Context Architecture**:
```typescript
interface AIContext {
  tenantId: string;
  userId: string;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  culturalProfile: CulturalContext;
  financialContext?: MudraContext;
  educationalContext?: SikshakContext;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Contextual Continuity**: AI remembers across modules
- **Cultural Consistency**: Same cultural intelligence everywhere
- **Resource Efficiency**: Single AI engine for all features

## 💰 **Module Architecture**

### **Mudra (Finance) - Microservice Design**
