# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Prototyping Plan
## AssistantPro - AI Personal Assistant for India

---

## üìã Core Problem and App Goal

### **Core Problem**
Indian smartphone users lack a culturally-aware, privacy-first AI personal assistant that can effectively manage their digital lives while understanding Indian communication patterns and cultural nuances. Existing AI assistants are designed for Western markets and require cloud data processing, compromising user privacy and failing to address India-specific needs.

### **App Goal**
Create a revolutionary privacy-first, mobile-first AI personal assistant specifically engineered for the Indian market that integrates three core AI modules:
- **AI Personal Finance (AI-PF)**: Automatic transaction analysis via SMS/email 
- **Conversational AI with Emotional Intelligence (C-AI)**: Culturally-aware AI companion

**MVP Success Target**: Validate core financial tracking and conversational AI features with 100+ active users in the Indian market within 3 months.
