## AI Agents & Automation

### Voice AI
*By Gustaf Alströmer*

Humans interact with businesses in many ways, but one way hasn't changed much in almost 100 years—and that's phone calls. You probably have experienced long wait times, voice trees, the press star or pound. In the end, we always want to talk to a human agent because the alternatives are just not that great.

But the new voice models and conversational LLMs are now incredibly good. And startups who take advantage of them are are now making voice AI bots that are indistinguishable from humans. It's pretty amazing and the unlock was the quality of these models.

Today, over a trillion calls exist between a business and a customer. What we like to do at YC is to peek into the future, and talking to a voice AI bot feels like experiencing the future - similar to how it felt to ride an autonomous car for the first time - it just works.

### AI Personal Assistant
*By Tom Blomfield*

Despite decades of productivity apps, emails still pile up, calendars get full, and tasks remain undone. Even the best organizational tools only help us keep track of what needs to get done—they don't actually do it. With recent advances in LLMs, we now have the potential to go from "to-do" lists to "done" lists"

I'd love to work with startups building the next generation of AI personal assistant: an LLM-powered system that deeply understands your work, routines, communication history, and personal preferences. Imagine an AI that has perfect memory of your personal correspondence, projects, and scheduling preferences— and can take action on your behalf.

Think of an assistant that knows how you typically respond to certain kinds of emails and can draft those responses for you—or even send them with your approval. It understands which meetings you usually accept and which you decline, and that can auto-schedule your week in a way that optimises your productivity and minimises travel. It keeps track of tasks you've completed in the past and how you approach new ones, so it can handle recurring processes without your constant input.

This is more than just filtering messages or auto-filling your calendar. I want to see a system that truly does the tasks a human personal assistant or chief of staff might otherwise do, allowing you to focus on the work that matters most.

### AI Personal Tutor for Everyone
*By Harj Taggar*

The idea of using computers to help people learn things has been a dream of computer nerds going back to the 1940's with Vannevar Bush's Memex idea, JCR Licklider's "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper in the 60's, and Alan Kay's Dynabook proposal in the 70's.

The holy grail has been to build a personalized learning experience for everyone but in practice, that's been hard to build. Most online education products deliver the same content to everyone who signs up for a course.

And today, with AI, we think it's finally possible to build a truly personal tutor for everyone. The latest reasoning capabilities let them break down complex topics step by step, in a way that should help explain even the most complicated subjects in a straightforward way.

With the latest foundation models being multimodal, they can now present these concepts by generating animations, manipulating 3D objects, and explaining concepts with voice.

We've already seen the impact that one great teacher, like Grant Sanderson and his 3blue1brown YouTube videos, can have on making it easy to understand complex ideas using beautiful visualizations and animations. Now imagine having that same quality of explanation available for every topic, personalized to each learner's needs, with an interactive AI tutor. This could really change the world.

If you're working on using AI to create personalized learning tools for anything, we'd love to hear from you.

### The Future of Education
*By Tom Blomfield*

Education is one of the world's largest and most important industries, yet it's also one of the most difficult to disrupt. About 100 million people are employed in education today, and about 1.5bn students are being educated every year. Traditional ways of teaching and learning have remained largely unchanged for decades, but things might be starting to shift.

The rise of AI—particularly large language models—promises to reshape how we teach, learn, and measure outcomes. These technologies have the potential to significantly improve educational access, personalize instruction, and free both teachers and learners from drudgery.

We're just starting to see new personalized study tools for students and grading platforms for teachers, but we're still very early in figuring out what AI can truly achieve here. One big challenge is figuring out the business model - while more than a billion people are engaged in education, budgets are notoriously tight, and purchasing cycles are horrendously slow.

If you fast-forward 10 or 20 years, it's impossible to believe that education is still going to be done in the same way it is today.

### AI Voice Assistants for Email
*By Tyler Bosmeny*

I want to meet teams who can help me process my inbox – with just my voice.

You see, every day I drive to work for 20 minutes, and every day I wish I could be using that time to triage emails, draft replies, delegate scheduling. What if we could all arrive at work each day already at Inbox Zero?

If you've used things like Vapi, Retell, or even ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, you know how good these voice agents are today. The use cases are far bigger than just driving. I know firsthand - It took me experiencing nerve damage in my arms to realize how much we still rely on keyboards for even the most basic tasks.

And email just might be the perfect starting place to build the most useful all-purpose assistant. Anyone with access to my inbox instantly knows my friends, my plans, my writing style, and so much more.

If you're an ambitious team interested in working on this, I'm interested in working with you.

### AI for Personal Finance
*By Gustaf Alströmer*

Most humans are not rational about their finances. But just being alive comes with a set of decisions you need to make about your finances. How much should I save for the future, where should I invest my money to take the right risk, and how should I think about debt and taxes? How you answer these questions today will impact your freedom to do the things you want in the future.

Until today, the answers have generally been asking friends, googling, hiring a financial advisor or maybe even asking your bank.

These options aren't great. They are filled with bias and don't have the full picture of your financial situation and goals. And hiring a great financial advisor is very expensive.

With LLMs, there is a unique opportunity to build software that gives every person access to personalized finance, investment, and tax advice at near-zero cost. They would use API's to access your complete financial situation and give completely personal unbiased advice.

If his is something you are thinking about building, you should consider applying to the YC Summer batch.

### A Secure AI App Store
*By Garry Tan*

We want a new kind of AI App Store and OS layer that sits on your computer or phone. It should:

1. **Protect User Data**  
    Users control what info each app can see—like your calendar, files, or browsing—but only if the user says so.

2. **Offer One Shared Memory**  
    All your personal details (preferences, past actions, context) stay in this layer, not scattered across a dozen apps.

3. **Help users find the best AI apps**  
    This App Store reviews and vets each AI tool so users can discover and install them safely.

4. **Help Developers Build**  
    Developers get infrastructure that help them avoid reinventing the wheel provided in simple APIs (like computer use, local LLaMA versioning, and app-level access control).

5. **Handle Payments**  
    Make it easy to pay for paid apps or services.

Imagine a travel AI that's great at finding flights that knows you usually travel with your nine-year-old who loves staring out the window, or an AI helper that recommends the original text an idea appeared in when you're reading essays or books. Apps built on this app store would have just a sliver of data you, the user, allows.

We need a system like this so AI can be both powerful and private. Some might say the major big tech companies will build this, but there is a time right now where instead, it might be you.

Done right, this will create more opportunity for startups and founders: their apps will be smarter with shared memory, and this will turn into a new marketplace that solves both distribution and monetization. If you're building it, please apply. We'd love to help you do it right.

### Browser & Computer Automation
*By Jared Friedman*

AI agents can now browse the web and use desktop applications. OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Computer Use showed this is possible, and there are a number of great open-source options too.

Letting AI agents use the web is like taking a brain in a jar and giving it hands. It can now do things.

It means that every website and every app now effectively has an API. It means that any workflow that people can do on a computer can be automated.

This probably 10x's the addressable use cases for AI agents. We can't wait to see what people build with it.

### AI Personal Staff for Everyone
*By David Lieb*

Software is a proven way to bring to everyone what only the rich could afford before. As recently as 2009, only the world's richest people could afford a private driver, but today, Uber, and now Waymo, have brought that to everyone. Another example: when I first started working on what would become Google Photos, I was surprised to learn that rich people hired actual human beings to go through all their photos and edit, label, and organize them. We built AI to automate that for billions of people.

Despite the explosion of software in the last decade, wealthy people still employ lots of human staff to provide personal services. These are things like tax accountants, personal lawyers, and money managers, but also personal trainers, private tutors, and even personal doctors. The list goes on and on. Why can only the rich afford this? Because software hasn't been able to replace these types of personalized knowledge work tasks…until now.

Over the next few years, we expect AI to get good enough to do most of these jobs. So if you are working to bring a part of this "personal AI staff" to every human on the planet, we'd love to hear from you.

### The Future of Software Engineering
*By Pete Koomen*

Language models can already write code better than most humans. This is going to bring the cost of building software down to zero.

So will agents kill the job of software developer? No! We'll need more human software engineers in the future because software is going to run almost everything.

These humans won't write much code directly. Instead, they'll manage teams of agents that build software for them. In addition to writing code, agents will perform most of the other specialized tasks required to build software: QA, deployment, security & compliance audits, translations, operations, etc.

We'd like to fund startups that enable small groups of generalist software developers to manage large teams of agents working together to build and ship lots of software.

If you're interested in building tools for the future of software engineering, we'd love to hear from you.

### B2A: Software Where the Customers Will All Be Agents
*By Dalton Caldwell*

A significant percentage of internet traffic consists of non-humans scraping and looking for information. These programs often end up impersonating humans to fill out forms or look for changes, most people build websites with human users in mind rather than scrapers.

With the advent of AI and agents, it seems like it's a good idea to build software and services where agents as customers are actively supported and documented rather than an edge case.

For example, APIs to help agents pay for hosting credits, or book travel, or engage into contracts with other parties. In the stock market, it's well understood that humans and programs are trading together, and in the future, this will only increase.

If you want to build services specifically aimed at best serving agents, we want to hear from you.

### Vertical AI Agents
*By Jared Friedman*

From 2005-2020, the invention of the interactive web application enabled a massive wave of B2B SaaS companies. Over 100 B2B SaaS unicorns were started, and nearly half of all venture funding went to this category.

It seems likely that for the next decade, we will see a parallel wave of companies building vertical AI agents.

What is a vertical AI agent? It's software that's built on top of LLMs that's been carefully tuned to be able to automate some kind of real, important work. In recent batches, we've had YC companies build an AI tax accountant, an AI medical biller, an AI phone support agent, an AI compliance agent, an AI quality assurance tester.

Some people previously derided ideas like this as "ChatGPT wrappers" but no one who has tried to deploy a system like this to production thinks so. Building systems like this that work in real-world conditions requires real agentic architectures, integrations with legacy systems, and deep domain understanding.

It's hard to get systems like this working right, but once you do, the growth can be phenomenal. The value prop of B2B SaaS was to make human workers incrementally more efficient. The value prop of vertical AI agents is to automate the work entirely. Vertical AI agents that reach human-level performance grow extremely quickly.

It's entirely possible this opportunity is big enough to mint another 100 unicorns. For every category with a successful B2B SaaS company, you could imagine an ever larger vertical AI company being built.

While many founders are already working on these ideas in the most obvious categories, we think it's still relatively undiscovered compared to the size of the opportunity, and there are many large categories still untouched.

### Inference AI Infrastructure in the World of Test-Time Compute
*By Diana Hu*

Until recently compute spend went into pre-training foundation models. But now with Deepseek R1 and OpenAI o1 and o3, there is a new scaling trend that suggests we'll need far more compute at inference time when AI apps actually use these models.

As AI apps 10x or even 100x the number of API calls to complex reasoning models, the infrastructure costs will become a real problem.

That's where new startups come in. There's room to rebuild the stack here: better software at inference-layer tooling, cheaper ways to handle GPU workloads, and optimizations that let AI apps scale without bleeding money.

It's the kind of unsexy-but-critical problem that often creates big opportunities.

## Winter 2025: The Golden Age of Building

Now is the best time in history to be a builder. We just watched giant robotic chopsticks pluck a falling skyscraper out of the sky. AI is transforming how we all work — particularly builders — faster than any technology in history. It feels like we are entering a golden age of building and we can use it to build things to make the country better. Below are some of the ideas we think will be especially cool to build in this golden age.

### Government Software
*By Harj Taggar*

Selling software to the government is notoriously hard and not something most builders would even think about doing. Still, the prize is huge if you can figure it out. Palantir is one of the only startups that managed to figure it out and their market cap today is $125 billion.

Now might be a uniquely good moment to give it a shot. The deficit is running high and there is hope the government will find ways to reduce spending and operate more efficiently. At the same time, AI is now powerful enough to automate many types of administrative work the government spends billions of dollars per year on.

If you combine those ideas, building AI software to automate work done by the government would both reduce spending and make the government more efficient. In particular, we've seen that LLMs are especially good at automating rote repetitive admin tasks like filling out forms, reviewing applications or summarizing documents. As consumers of government services, we'd all benefit from more efficiency, imagine never having to wait in line at the DMV again.

It's hard to think of something that sounds less appealing as a place to look for startup ideas than the government but if you're up for digging in that space we'd love to hear from you.

### Public Safety Technology
*By Garry Tan*

We all deserve to be safe in our homes, and while walking around on our streets. This is a basic thing civilization should afford its citizens. Startups are already on the case. License plate cameras built by Flock Safety (YC S17) now help solve 10% of reported crimes in the USA and they're aiming to get to 25% of all crime by next year. Abel Police (YC S24) cuts the amount of time police officers spend filling out paperwork from hours to minutes, giving them up to 25% more hours per day to do real police work.

Public safety tech can and will make a real difference. We are especially interested in hearing from you if you're working on these ideas:

- **Advanced Computer Vision:** Your startup could develop technology that uses computer vision to enhance safety—identifying suspicious activities or people in distress from video feeds, without compromising individual privacy.
- **Emergency Response Enhancements:** Technologies that improve the speed and coordination of emergency responses are lifesavers. If you have an idea that can get help to where it's needed faster, we want to help you make it happen.
- **Community Safety Tools:** We are looking for tools that improve how communities and law enforcement interact. Your solution could make it easier for neighbors to watch out for each other and stay informed about their safety.
- **Efficient Law Enforcement Technologies:** We're interested in technologies that help law enforcement do their jobs more effectively and fairly, from workload management to increasing accuracy in their operations.

If your startup is ready to be part of this movement, we want to hear from you.

### Fintech 2.0
*By Dalton Caldwell*

The last two years have been a rough time for fintech startups. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to regulators clamping down on new startups and investors fled the space. We're optimistic this is about to change and now is a great time to start a fintech startup.

Historically the hardest thing about starting a new financial startup was the difficulty of getting a deal with a bank or other regulated partner. We are now in a new era where this keeps becoming easier with the advent of providers like Stripe and new core technologies like stablecoins.

AI tools will inevitably cause the financial industry to change rapidly and we believe there could be a structural advantage for a small startup without any legacy systems or processes to quickly build global financial products of the future.

We believe this is the perfect time to start a new generation of financial technology companies built on top of the infrastructure now available. We would like to see ideas around insurance, investment banking, wealth management, international payments and more.

### One Million Jobs 2.0
*By Dalton Caldwell*

We would like to fund startups that have a useful need to employ a million workers in a way that uniquely needs humans to do the job and there will be no structural need for the job to be done with AI.

In the past, when massive technological change came about, people have ended up doing different types of work than they did in the past. For example, a lot of people used to be farmers, and then because of machinery a lot fewer people were farmers. The same goes for careers like elevator operators and typists.

Often the types of new careers that are created have better working conditions and are more helpful to humanity. In this new AI driven world, these might be tools for more people to run their own local businesses, or be able to earn a living by providing services to other humans either online or offline.
