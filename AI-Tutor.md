### AI Personal Tutor for Everyone
*By Harj Taggar*

The idea of using computers to help people learn things has been a dream of computer nerds going back to the 1940's with Vannevar Bush's Memex idea, JCR Licklider's "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper in the 60's, and Alan Kay's Dynabook proposal in the 70's.

The holy grail has been to build a personalized learning experience for everyone but in practice, that's been hard to build. Most online education products deliver the same content to everyone who signs up for a course.

And today, with AI, we think it's finally possible to build a truly personal tutor for everyone. The latest reasoning capabilities let them break down complex topics step by step, in a way that should help explain even the most complicated subjects in a straightforward way.

With the latest foundation models being multimodal, they can now present these concepts by generating animations, manipulating 3D objects, and explaining concepts with voice.

We've already seen the impact that one great teacher, like Grant Sanderson and his 3blue1brown YouTube videos, can have on making it easy to understand complex ideas using beautiful visualizations and animations. Now imagine having that same quality of explanation available for every topic, personalized to each learner's needs, with an interactive AI tutor. This could really change the world.
